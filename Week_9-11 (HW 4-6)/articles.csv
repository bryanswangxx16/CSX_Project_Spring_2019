0,UPDATE 1-Investors return to euro zone havens as Trump resumes pressure on China - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:51 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago","3 Min Read* Core euro zone bond yields fall as Trump threatens China * Final PMI shows stronger Germany, though slow growth in bloc * Italy hit by renewed coalition stability concerns (Adds quote, and euro zone data, updates pricing) By Virginia Furness LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Core euro zone bonds yields fell on Monday as investors sought safe havens after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, while PMI data pointed to anaemic growth in the euro zone. Trump’s move marked an escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Global equity markets fell, with China’s main indexes down 5 percent. Treasuries rallied after Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would rise on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, went negative for the first time since April 30, down 2.4 basis points on the day to -0.002 percent before rising to 0.014 percent. “Everyone was quite optimistic that they were close to a deal … “ said Daniel Lenz, rates strategist at DZ Bankit. Trump’s threat “may cause the opposite action, talks might come to a stop, which is the fear everyone has.” Most other core 10-year yields in the bloc fell around two basis points,. Data on Monday painted a mixed picture of euro zone economic growth. Germany’s services stood out among a gloomier bloc-wide report from research firm Markit’s final purchasing manager data for April. German services created jobs in April at the fastest rate in more than a decade, offsetting deteriorating manufacturing, the data showed. But overall, weakness in euro zone manufacturing increasingly affected the dominant services industry. IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dipped to 51.5 in April from March’s 51.6. However, overall investor improved for the third month in a row, reaching its highest since November 2018, the Sentix research group said on Monday. ITALY IN FOCUS Italian government bonds underperformed the rest of the periphery. Concerns about the stability of the Italian government added to worries about global trade. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said on Monday a graft case involving a junior minister from the ruling League party would trigger a government crisis only if the League itself pushed for it. Italy’s short-dated bonds were up to six basis points higher before pulling back. The spread of its 10-year debt over Germany’s widened to nearly 260 basis points for the first time since April 30.

1,UPDATE 1-Malaysia sends ex-Goldman banker to U.S. for 10 months to face 1MDB charges - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:34 AM / in 2 minutes","3 Min Read(Changes sourcing, adds attorney general’s statement) KUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Reuters) - Malaysia has extradited a former Goldman Sachs banker to the United States for 10 months to face criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, its attorney general said on Monday. Malaysian Roger Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds diverted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund. He left Goldman Sachs in 2014. Ng had agreed to be sent to the United States, but the proceedings were delayed after Malaysia’s home minister said he should first face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation. Following negotiations, the two countries have now agreed for Ng to be temporarily surrendered to the United States for ten months and for the U.S. case against him to proceed first, Malaysia’s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement. Ng was sent to the United States on May 3 and will be returned to Malaysia to face charges as soon as the U.S. proceedings are concluded. “The period of temporary surrender may be extended upon mutual agreement by Malaysia and the U.S.,” Thomas added. Goldman Sachs is under scrutiny for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. The DoJ has estimated that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used. Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales. He was also charged in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law targeting official bribery abroad. Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB funds. Leissner has pleaded guilty. Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak. Najib, who lost a general election last year, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

2,US STOCKS-Futures sink after Trump escalates China tariff threat - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:36 AM / in a few seconds","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Futures fall: Dow 1.92%, S&P 1.81%, Nasdaq 2.29% By Amy Caren Daniel May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures plunged on Monday after President Donald Trump shocked investors by threatening to hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, raising fears of a global slowdown and halting a relative period of calm in the markets. S&P futures lost more than 2% overnight after the Wall Street Journal reported China was considering canceling a round of U.S. talks set for this week in the wake of Trump’s comments. However, China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States for trade talks. Trump said tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate thanks to progress between the two sides. Investors pulled back from riskier bets on fears the trade war between the world’s biggest economies was escalating, especially as hopes of a deal have helped stocks surge this year, with the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq indexes hitting record highs last week. All the 28 Dow components that were trading premarket were in the red. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 3.3%, while Caterpillar Inc also declined 3.3%. “The risk-off sentiment has been the response to this swerve from Trump,” said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. “While it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will press ahead with the added tariffs, it’s already evident that markets are taking some risk off the table, undermining the base case that investors had been pricing in: a formalized US-China trade deal in the near future.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked to its highest level since Jan. 30. Chipmakers, which get a good portion of their revenue from China, tumbled. Shares of Nvidia Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Intel Corp fell between 2.4% and 5.3%. At 6:09 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 508 points, or 1.92%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 53.25 points, or 1.81% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 179.75 points, or 2.29%. Marquee names such as Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Netflix Inc fell between 1.9% and 3.4%. Tesla Inc fell 2.3% after U.S. trade officials rejected the company’s bid for relief from Trump’s tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot “brain” of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles.

3,Boeing 737 slides off runway in Russia's Norilsk - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:31 AM / in 16 minutes","1 Min ReadMOSCOW, May 6 (Reuters) - A Boeing 737-800 passenger jet operated by Russia’s NordStar carrier slid off a runway as it landed on Monday in a heavy snowstorm in the Russian city of Norilsk with 101 passengers and 6 crew members on board, NordStar said. No one was hurt and the plane did not sustain any damage, the carrier said in a statement, adding that passengers were able to disembark from the plane themselves. NordStar blamed the incident on the poor weather conditions. It is the second such incident involving a Boeing 737-800 in a matter of days. On Friday night, a jetliner chartered by the U.S. military carrying 143 people slid into a shallow river while landing in Florida during a thunderstorm, injuring 22 people. U.S. federal investigators on Saturday began investigating the reason for the incident.

4,PRECIOUS-Gold gains as Trump's tariff threat dampens risk taking - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:16 AM / Updated 33 minutes ago","3 Min Read* Trump says he will hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week * SPDR gold holdings fall to lowest since Oct. 11 * Asian, European stocks tumble (Updates prices, adds fresh comments) By Harshith Aranya May 6 (Reuters) - Gold prices climbed on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions, which prompted investors to sell riskier assets and boost safe-haven bullion. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,281.63 per ounce, as of 0930 GMT. U.S. gold futures also gained 0.2 percent to $1,283.20 an ounce. U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday announced he would hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported into the United States from China. “We are seeing the markets reacting to uncertainty about trade talks. It is creating some nervousness in the markets. The dollar is a tad stronger, countering some of the potential moves we would have seen otherwise in gold,” said Ole Hansen, commodity strategist at Saxo Bank. Trump’s comments dented global shares and oil prices, while boosting the yen, which like the yellow metal, is considered a safe haven during times of a geopolitical or global economic turmoil. “The hedge fund community is extremely confused, flipping long and short positions. $1,290 is the key level for gold, and if prices break above that we could see quite an addition on the long side,” Hansen said. Hedge funds and money managers switched to a net long position in COMEX gold in the week to April 30, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. Last week, the mood among gold investors had turned gloomy, pushing the metal to a four-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a rate cut this year. “Despite the increase in gold prices (on Monday), technical analysis suggests that downward pressure on the yellow metal continues to manifest,” OCBC analysts said in a research note, adding that most of the intra-day move was likely related to covering short positions and hedging against market risks. “The medium term still suggests a large range-bound consolidation of $1,270 to $1,300.” Meanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold backed exchange, were at their lowest since Oct. 11. Holdings fell 0.6 percent on Friday. However, physical demand for the metal had been robust last week with India and Singapore leveraging the correction in prices ahead of a key gold-buying festival. Elsewhere, silver slipped 0.5 percent to $14.85 per ounce, while platinum fell 0.6 percent to $863.94 per ounce. Palladium dropped 0.6 percent to $1,363.40 an ounce.

6,"Stronger shekel a challenge for Israeli inflation, rate hikes - MPC member - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  9:14 AM / in 2 hours","2 Min ReadJERUSALEM, May 6 (Reuters) - A strengthening shekel has become a concern for the Bank of Israel and could help to delay further interest rate increases, a voting member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee said on Monday. Andrew Abir, head of market operations at the Bank of Israel, said the exchange rate was another challenge that would affect future monetary policy in addition to weakening global growth and trade that have helped to lower expectations for tightening in the United States and Europe. “The depreciation of the shekel in 2018 has been partly reversed, and if the appreciation continues, as the monetary committee has emphasised, it may delay the increase of inflation toward the midpoint of the target range,” he told a conference. The shekel has appreciated some 4 percent so far this year versus the dollar after an 8 percent depreciation in 2018. Against a basket of currencies of Israel’s main trading partners, the shekel stands near a six-month high. After a surprise rate increase in November, policymakers have held the benchmark lending rate at 0.25 percent at the subsequent three meetings. The central bank has said future hikes would be gradual and cautious and depended on inflation moving near the midpoint of the target - or around 2 percent. The rate stood at 1.4 percent in March. The next decision is May 20 but an increase is not widely expected until later in 2019. The bank’s own economists project a quarter-point increase towards the end of the third quarter.

7,UPDATE 1-European shares slide as U.S.-China trade tensions return - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:09 AM / a minute ago","4 Min Read* All sectors fall, auto stocks decline the most * Country indexes underperform STOXX 600 * Telenor rises on merger plans for its Asian arm * Stabilus cuts FY outlook (Adds details, quote; Updates prices) By Medha Singh May 6 (Reuters) - European shares were deep in the red on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly ratcheted up trade tensions between the world’s largest economies by vowing to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by this week, prompting investors to flee riskier bets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index had shed 1.4 percent by 0845 GMT, its steepest fall in six weeks. Sharper selling was seen in regional bourses with Germany , France, Italy and Spain down between 1.6 percent and 2.2 percent. Markets in Britain remained shut for a bank holiday. The narrower Euro Stoxx index slipped 2.2 percent, on pace for its worst day since early December. Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal have partly been the reason for the strong rally in equities this year, with most country indices recovering from a major rout last year and hitting multi-month highs. Oil prices slumped and Asian shares took a beating after Trump, in an unexpected move to mount pressure on China, said on Sunday that trade talks were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods and target hundreds of billions more soon. China’s foreign ministry still said a Chinese delegation is preparing to go to United States for trade talks. “Optimism had only just been picking up on hopes that China’s economy was finding stability and this threat from Trump risks derailing that train in a hurry,” said Han Tan, Market Analyst at FXTM. “Ailing demand would prove another thorn in the side for Germany’s manufacturing sector.” Latest survey showed the euro zone economy limped into the second quarter with lacklustre growth as weakness in the manufacturing sector is increasingly affecting the bloc’s dominant services industry. Auto stocks’ - sensitive to trade news - tumbled 3.5 percent, leading broad-based declines among European sectors. Luxembourg-based Stabilus slipped after the auto supplier cut its full-year guidance on account of the ongoing weakness in the global auto industry. Chipmaker stocks AMS, STMicro and Siltronic , which are highly sensitive to trade war news, lost between 2.7 to 5 percent. In a relatively light day for earnings, dealmaking was in focus. French energy major Total said it had reached a binding agreement with Occidental to acquire Anadarko assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa for a consideration of $8.8 billion. Telecoms, a defensive sector, outperformed. Shares in Norway’s Telenor rose 3.5 percent after the company and Malaysia’s Axiata Group said they are in talks to form a jointly-owned Asian telecoms company. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday stepped up calls for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a cross-party deal to leave the European Union, following poor results for both parties in local elections on Thursday.

8,EXPLAINER-Counting the cost of the U.S.-China trade war so far - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:06 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","6 Min ReadHONG KONG, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh threats of tariff hikes on Chinese imports this week marked a new escalation in the trade dispute between the world’s top two economies and a reversal of months of apparent progress in negotiations. The trade war formally kicked off in July last year with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, which were followed by tariffs on an extra $16 billion in August and another $200 billion in September. China has retaliated on each of these measures with its own set of tariffs. A subsequent threat to raise tariffs on the September list of products to 25 percent from 10 percent in March was suspended, pending trade talks. In the latest development, Trump on Sunday said those increases could now take effect on Friday and that he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods “shortly”. All up, the tariffs would effectively cover all imports of Chinese goods into the United States. Here is a look at the impact the U.S.-China trade war has had so far on the two economies and the rest of the world. China’s customs data shows exports to the United States in March fell 47 percent from June 2018, which was the last month before the first round of tariffs kicked in. Imports from the United States in March were 17 percent lower. Cumulatively, in the first quarter of 2019, Chinese imports fell almost a third year-on-year, while exports fell almost a tenth. In dollar terms, a decline in two-way trade of $25 billion accounts for around 0.5 percent of global trade. Compounding the decline in imports into China was a broader weakening in domestic demand following Beijing’s campaign against financial risk taking. The bulk of the decline in U.S. exports to China is in raw materials and food. They represent about a third of the total and have more than halved, according to Oxford Economics. But U.S. firms in other sectors, including Caterpillar and Apple, have also issued China sales warnings. Of all Chinese exports to the United States, machinery and electrical equipment have taken the biggest hit. Most analysts estimate direct U.S. losses so far of 0.1-0.2 percent of gross domestic product, while for China the damage could be 0.3-0.6 percent of GDP. These could grow with more, and higher tariffs. Theses estimates, however, do not take into account how the trade war impacts investment and spending decisions by firms and consumers while domestic policy measures also muddy the waters considerably. Partly reacting to external headwinds, the U.S. Federal Reserve has put monetary policy tightening on hold with markets now actually forecasting a rate cut this year. China has also responded with cuts in bank reserve requirement ratios, which have boosted domestic lending to a record 5.81 trillion yuan ($862.8 billion) in the first quarter. Tax cuts are estimated to unleash an extra 2 trillion yuan, while local governments are also allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects. China’s economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter. In the last pre-tariff quarter, April-June 2018, the economy grew 6.7 percent, but the difference accounts for some domestically-inflicted slowdown, U.S. import frontloading, domestic policy moves, and other seasonal factors. The U.S. economy grew 3.2 percent in the first quarter, faster than the 2.9 percent in the last pre-tariff quarter. CROSS-BORDER TRADE IMPACT S&P Global Market Intelligence’s trade data firm Panjiva says U.S. import flows are being re-routed. U.S. imports of furniture from China fell 13.5 percent in the first quarter, which compares with a 37.2 percent increase in imports from Vietnam and a 19.3 percent rise from Taiwan. For refrigerators, imports from China fell 24.1 percent, but South Korea and Mexico each saw 32 percent jumps. Tire imports from China fell 28.6 percent, while those from Vietnam surged 141.7 percent. A DBS analysis of Asian supply chains for U.S.-bound products shows the biggest risks in machinery and electrical equipment in South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan. South Korea’s minerals and petrochemicals exports were also exposed, as well as Indonesia’s transportation industry, according to the DBS report. A study by think-tank Centre for Economic Policy Research showed about $165 billion in trade has been lost or redirected in order to avoid tariffs. Since last July, the S&P 500 index has risen 8 percent while Shanghai stocks are up 5 percent, though this is a reflection of looser-than-expected monetary policy globally and in China, as well as hopes for a trade deal this year. The yuan took a hit last year, falling 5.3 percent against the U.S. dollar, before stabilising in 2019. UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele estimates more tit-for-tat tariffs could shrink U.S. earnings by 5 percent, which, coupled with falling valuations could result in a 10-15 percent decline in U.S. equities. Chinese equities could also fall 15-20 percent, while the yuan might breach 7.0 per dollar. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore;

9,China trade team still preparing to go for talks after Trump cranks up pressure - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:02 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","6 Min ReadBEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China said on Monday that a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States for trade talks, after U.S. President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on Beijing to reach a deal, saying he would hike tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Trump’s comments on Sunday marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies, and a shift in tone from the president, who as recently as Friday had cited progress toward a deal. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled on his remarks, as negotiations to end the months-long trade war were thrown into doubt. [MKTS/GLOB] “We are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation. What I can tell you is that China’s team is preparing to go to the United States for the discussions,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing.  But Geng did not say if Vice Premier Liu He, who is China’s lead official in the negotiations, was to be part of the delegation as originally planned.  “What is of vital importance is that we still hope the United States can work hard with China to meet each other half way, and strive to reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement on the basis of mutual respect,” Geng said.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that China was considering cancelling this week’s meetings in Washington in light of Trump’s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise. A less than rosy update from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some previous commitments, prompted Trump’s decision. “The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Trump said in a tweet. Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate thanks to progress between the two sides. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly,” essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. U.S. officials did not weigh in on whether they expected talks to go ahead this week. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The atmosphere of the negotiations has changed,” said a Chinese official with knowledge of the situation.  Whether the talks proceed and how they proceed are issues that are now being re-evaluated, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  “All that depends on the attitude of the United States,” the official said. Chinese media outlets have been told not to independently report on Trump’s tweets, and instead adhere to any report from the official Xinhua news agency, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.  Global financial markets, which had been expecting news of a trade deal soon, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled, with China’s main indexes plunging 5 percent. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets.” Mindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump had also suggested the duties were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. “The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,” he tweeted. Tariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by the companies importing the goods, and most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while supportive of Trump’s crackdown on China’s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded. “Raising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,” said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Nevertheless, the president’s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to “hang tough” in a tweet: “Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.” One Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence.  “The urgency is gone. So, it’s likely to see a longer trade war,” the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the topic. The trade war resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including autos, technology - and above all, agriculture, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. On Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the round in Beijing “productive,” and one White House official told Reuters that dates were being looked at for a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in June. Last week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, but a Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained. The increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday would be the first since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year.  Negotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be removed, while Trump wants to keep some, if not all, of them as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.

10,Trump's former lawyer Cohen to report to prison for hush payments - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:04 AM / in 31 minutes","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, the lawyer who once vowed to “take a bullet” for President Donald Trump but now calls him a “con man,” on Monday will begin serving a three-year prison sentence for arranging hush payments to two women who said they had sexual encounters with the president and lying to the U.S. Congress. Cohen, Trump’s longtime former personal attorney, must report by 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) to the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, New York, about 70 miles (110 km) northwest of New York City. He is expected to stay at the prison’s minimum security camp. Cohen’s prison term completes a stunning fall for the 52-year-old native of New York’s Long Island whose career was tethered to Trump as he evolved from wealthy real estate developer to reality TV personality to politician. For more than a decade, Cohen served as Trump’s personal lawyer and self-described “fixer.” The relationship began to sour after FBI agents raided Cohen’s Rockefeller Center office and Park Avenue hotel room in April 2018 as part of an investigation that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The information gathered in the raids contributed to a series of criminal charges against Cohen that caused his dramatic split with Trump. Cohen publicly broke with Trump in July 2018, telling ABC News he intended to put family and loyalty to his country ahead of the president. Cohen and his wife, Laura Shusterman, 49, have two adult children, Samantha and Jake. In congressional testimony in February in Washington, Cohen said, “I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat.” During his sentencing in December in New York, Cohen said, “My weakness can be characterized as a blind loyalty to Donald Trump, and I was weak for not having the strength to question and to refuse his demands. I have already spent years living a personal and mental incarceration.” Cohen said during his sentencing he would provide as much information as he could to prosecutors about his former boss. Trump, for this part, has blasted Cohen on Twitter, calling him a “weak person” as well as a “bad lawyer and fraudster.”  Cohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to violating campaign finance law, bank fraud and tax evasion in a case handled by federal prosecutors in New York. Prosecutors said Trump himself directed illegal payments orchestrated by Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal to avert a scandal shortly before the 2016 election. Cohen told the court Trump ordered a $130,000 payment to Daniels and a $150,000 payment to McDougal to keep them quiet. Trump has denied sexual relationships with the women and said he never directed Cohen to do anything illegal. Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump tower project in Russia that was being negotiated at the same time he was running for president. Prosecutors said Cohen provided false statements in closed-door testimony to lawmakers to create the impression the project had ended by the time the state-by-state Republican presidential nomination race began, when in fact talks had continued well beyond that point. U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan sentenced Cohen to three years in prison in both cases. “Each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition,” Pauley said at the sentencing hearing. Cohen’s prison time could be reduced by about 15 percent for good behavior.

11,"Factbox: Tweets tell story of souring Trump, Cohen relationship - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  10:24 AM / in 33 minutes","5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, have both used Twitter to spar with enemies over the last decade. Cohen, 52, is due to report to federal prison in New York state on Monday to begin serving a three-year sentence for crimes including illegal hush payments to women on Trump’s behalf. The two men’s Twitter histories trace the deterioration of their relationship, from pledges of loyalty and admiration to open hostility, over the last year as the criminal case against Cohen unfolded. “Good article: ‘What Happened to American Men’ from @Newsmax by Michael Cohen” - Trump on Aug. 1, 2012, promoting an article Cohen wrote endorsing Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. “Did my duty, stood on a 2 plus hour line and voted for @realDonaldTrump! #MAGA #TrumpPence16” -Cohen on Nov. 8, 2016 - Election Day - captioning a photo of himself. “Thank you @nytimes for front page profile and using good pictures of me. I will always proudly and fiercely defend my boss, friend and our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump against those who raise false accusations against him and the family. #PresidentsDay2018” - Cohen on Feb. 19, 2018, linking to a New York Times profile describing him as Trump’s “fixer” and “loyal defender.” “I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA” - Cohen on April 8, 2018, the day before authorities raided his office and hotel room. “The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will ‘flip.’ They use non-existent ‘sources’ and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family.” “Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories.” “Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!” - Trump on April 21, 2018, in a series of three tweets posted the day after the New York Times published an article about the “strong possibility” that Cohen would cooperate with prosecutors. “If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!” - Trump on Aug. 22, 2018, the day after Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes implicating Trump. “I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. ‘Justice’ took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’ - make up stories in order to get a ‘deal.’ Such respect for a brave man! - Trump, the same day, contrasting Cohen with his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who had not yet pleaded guilty to federal charges. “Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!” - Trump on Dec. 13, 2018, the day after Cohen was sentenced. “As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it.” - Michael Cohen on Jan. 17, the day the Wall Street Journal reported that Cohen hired a technology firm to rig early polls in the Republican nominating contest to favor Trump. “Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!” - Trump on March 8, the day after reports that Cohen had sought a pardon after he was raided. “Just another set of lies by @POTUS @realdonaldtrump. Mr. President...let me remind you that today is #InternationalWomensDay. You may want use today to apologize for your own #lies and #DirtyDeeds to women like Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford.” - Cohen, half an hour later, referring to the two women he said he paid off at Trump’s direction.

12,Showdown looms between Congress and attorney general over Mueller report deadline - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  5:02 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr is headed for a showdown on Monday with Democrats in Congress, as lawmakers prepared to begin contempt proceedings against the top U.S. law enforcement officer if he fails to hand over the full, unredacted Mueller report. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler gave Barr until 9 a.m. EDT to produce the full report and underlying evidence from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation into Russian election meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Nadler has subpoenaed the material but Barr missed an initial deadline to provide it last week. Nadler’s committee views the full Mueller report as vital to its own corruption and obstruction of justice investigation of President Donald Trump. The chairs of five other House committees investigating the president have also called for its release.  The Mueller report details extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Moscow, and the campaign’s expectation that it would benefit from Russian hacking and propaganda. It also describes actions Trump took to try to impede Mueller’s investigation. Barr released a redacted version of the report on April 18. Some Democrats have called on Barr to resign, accusing him of protecting Trump by clearing the president of criminal obstruction and excusing actions that many view as evidence of misconduct. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi even charged that the attorney general lied to Congress, adding: “That’s a crime.” In a letter to the attorney general setting out the Monday morning deadline, Nadler put Barr on notice that “the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse” unless the Justice Department complies with the subpoena. The Justice Department declined to comment on the letter. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat on Nadler’s panel, said on Sunday that Barr could avoid contempt proceedings by assuring lawmakers that he would provide the material. “If Mr. Barr agrees to turn over what we’ve requested in a reasonable way, no one on the committee is interested in moving forward,” Cicilline told Fox News Sunday.   Republicans have rejected Nadler’s efforts as political theater, which they say is intended to satisfy a progressive voter base that helped give Democrats control of the House of Representatives in last year’s midterm election. But unless Barr complies, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to begin moving forward on Monday with a contempt citation that could lead to a civil court case against Barr, raising the possibility of fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. Cicilline and others also say lawmakers could exercise  their little-used authority to act outside the court system and fine or even imprison officials who do not comply with congressional subpoenas. “We have to take this in a deadly serious way,” said Cicilline, who warned that the Trump administration could “extinguish our oversight function” by refusing to provide testimony and evidence.   After missing the initial subpoena deadline for turning over the Mueller material, Barr skipped a hearing before Nadler’s committee on Thursday after Democrats adopted an aggressive format that would have subjected the attorney general to questions from staff attorneys.

14,Altice Europe to save 110 million euros annually via debt deal - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  6:16 AM / in 2 hours","2 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - Telecoms and cable company Altice Europe will save more than 110 million euros ($123 million) annually after refinancing debt in a deal that it said would strengthen its financial position. The company, whose brands include SFR in France, said it had successfully priced and allocated 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion) worth of new 8-year senior bond notes at its Altice Luxembourg SA unit following an offering that was oversubscribed. Altice Europe, founded by billionaire Patrick Drahi, has been selling assets and restructuring to reduce its debt burden. It announced last month that profits at its main French business had improved in the first quarter. In the past year, Amsterdam-listed Altice Europe has shifted its focus from cost-cutting towards gaining clients while selling infrastructure assets to reassure investors, after making heavy investments in broadcasting rights. [nL8N1XW5OZ] Altice Europe had net debts of around 29 billion euros at the end of 2018. The company has a current stock market capitalization of around 5.2 billion euros. “This refinancing transaction demonstrates Altice Europe’s commitment to proactively managing its liabilities across its capital structure, significantly improving its maturity schedule, reducing its gross leverage and moving closer to its leverage target while reducing its annual cash cost,” said Altice Europe chief financial officer Malo Corbin. “We continue to receive strong support from the debt capital markets to execute on our strategy and achieve our revenue and cash flow growth targets for 2019,” added Corbin. Shares in Altice Europe dipped 1.1 percent, tracking a broader decline on global markets after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations.

15,"WRAPUP 4-China stocks fall most in over 3 years on tariff threats, yuan tumbles - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  8:59 AM / in 2 minutes","6 Min Read(Updates with Hong Kong stocks, yuan domestic close) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes fell the most in more than three years. The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Around 1,000 mainland firms plummet the maximum allowed 10 percent daily limit. Market sentiment was lifted somewhat after China said its trade delegation is preparing to go to the United States. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ended down 2.9 percent, recouping some lost ground in the late afternoon session. “Afternoon trading was quieter. MOFCOM’s announcement helped, at least people know that the negotiations will carry on,” said Steven Leung, sales director at broker UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. The yuan’s losses also narrowed after the news, closing at 6.7666 per dollar in onshore trade. In earlier trade, the yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it would cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily but is not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilise the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares have surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it would cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung. $1 = 6.7886 Chinese yuan

16,"EMERGING MARKETS-Stocks wilt, currencies slide on Trump tariff threat - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  8:39 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","2 Min ReadMay 6 (Reuters) - Emerging-market shares fell on Monday on trade conflict re-emerged  between the United States and China when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if an agreement was not reached soon. MSCI’s index for emerging-market stocks fell 1.5 percent as investors ran to safety of bonds, gold and other less-risky assets. The Chinese yuan led declines by emerging-market currencies, heading for its biggest drop in 10 months. Trump ramped up pressure on China on Sunday to reach a trade deal, saying he would raise U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. China’s foreign ministry said it still hoped the United States would meet China halfway and said a Chinese delegation was preparing to go to the U.S. The Wall Street Journal had reported that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. Equities fell across the developing world, particularly in Asia, as negotiations to end a trade war between the world’s largest economies were thrown into doubt. Mainland China shares plunged almost 6 percent, their worst one-day fall since February 2016. The yuan was set for its biggest drop in 10 months. Oil prices slumped taking a toll on currencies of net exporters like Russia’s rouble. Turkey’s lira weakened against the dollar but was off a low of 6.02, which it reached amid concern over legal challenges to local election results in Istanbul. The lira has slumped 11 percent so far this year. South Africa’s rand fell as worries grew over elections on Wednesday.

17,Global stocks reel as Trump tweets on China unnerve markets - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:36 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled to a one-month low and German bond yields slipped back into negative territory on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, triggering a global rout in risky assets. In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, signaling a major shift. Trump had earlier cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Global investors were caught off guard as they had been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon. “The market was caught on the wrong foot as everyone expected talks were heading in the right direction and almost close to finishing,” said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at Commerzbank. “This was totally out of the blue and the reaction is that we have more risk aversion today.” The latest episode in the trade war comes on the back of weeks of low market volatility across asset classes and a growing swathe of tepid but steady economic data with little negative surprises lulling investors into a sense of calm. Chinese shares plunged more than 6 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 1.6 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan fell to a 10-month low.  MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell half a percent. Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. The tweets stirred up the hitherto calm market mood arising from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday a delegation was preparing to go to United States for trade talks. While many market watchers including ING regard the latest episode as a negotiating tactic by Trump, investors pared their positions in risky assets after recent gains. European stock markets were a sea of red while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent, signaling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. Germany’s main stock index was down 1.8 percent while a broader index of European shares declined 2 percent to its lowest level since early April. Moves were slightly exaggerated, with Japanese markets still on holidays while London markets were shut for a local holiday. Losses in equities translated into gains for bonds with benchmark government bond yields in Germany retreating to a shade below zero and not far from a 2-1/2-year low of minus 0.09 percent hit in late March. Emerging market currencies and commodity-linked currencies were the hardest hit with the Australian dollar falling half a percent against the greenback while the offshore yuan swooned nearly a percent In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices.  U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.69 per barrel - still off 1.3 percent on the day. Brent crude LCOc1 was 1.8 percent lower at $69.59 per barrel. The selloff in risky assets burnished the lure of gold with spot gold up 0.25 percent to trade at $1,282.20 per ounce.

18,Euro zone investor morale rises in May as recession fears fade - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  8:37 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","2 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - Investor morale in the euro zone improved in May for the third month in a row to hit its highest level since November 2018, helped by a buoyant global environment and the danger of a disorderly Brexit being averted until October. The Sentix research group said on Monday its investor sentiment index for the euro zone rose to 5.3 in May from -0.3 in April. Analysts had expected a reading of 1.4. “In May, the economic situation continued to improve globally, but also in Europe. Fears of a recession are thus receding into the background,” Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner said in a statement. A sub-index on euro zone expectations improved for the fourth month in a row, reaching -0.3, its highest level since March last year. A current situation index rose to 11.0 from 3.8. Investor morale also improved in Germany, with an investor sentiment index for Europe’s largest economy rising to 7.9 - its highest since November 2018 - from 2.1 in April. “Apparently, the spark from the Chinese economy, which has recovered significantly since the start of the year, is increasingly jumping over to the export-dependent German economy,” Huebner said.

19,China gives modest boost to economy with RRR cut amid renewed trade tensions - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  1:56 AM / in 3 hours","5 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) to release about 280 billion yuan ($41 billion) for some small and medium-sized banks, in a targeted move to help companies struggling amid an economic slowdown. The cut in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves would be the smallest since January 2018, when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) started its latest round of policy easing to support the world’s second-largest economy.  The cut, while widely expected at some point, was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump sharply escalated trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The PBOC said in a statement that the reduction will come into effect on May 15. The funds will be used for loans to small and private companies. The central bank said it will cut the RRR for about 1,000 rural commercial banks operating in counties to 8 percent, equal to the RRR for smaller rural credit cooperatives. The move will help lower funding costs for small and micro firms, the PBOC said. Small and medium-sized banks currently have RRRs ranging from 10 percent to 11.5 percent. The PBOC has already delivered five RRR cuts since early 2018, lowering the ratio to 13.5 percent for big banks and 11.5 percent for small-to medium-sized lenders. The central bank pumped out 3.35 trillion yuan in net liquidity through the five reserve cuts, according to Reuters calculations based on PBOC data and analyst estimates. Analysts believe PBOC has less room to ease policy after it cut RRRs and interest rates aggressively during the global financial crisis, and delivered more cuts in 2012 and 2015 -  a year marked by a stock market crash and a slide in the yuan. The government, which is relying more on increased infrastructure spending and tax cuts to support economic growth this year, has repeated said it will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus. Previous policy announcements usually fell on non-trading times after the market closed, analysts from Citic Securities noted, making the timing of this announcement intriguing. Just hours earlier, Trump issued a series tweets in which he complained that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. His comments upended markets that had been enjoying a period of calm thanks to signs of robust growth in China and the United States, and from previous comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well.      Some analysts believed the PBOC was seeking to reassure investors unnerved by Trump’s latest comments. “I think it is a move to calm the market, to offset the impact from the trade talks, telling you that ‘I can give some stimulus during the most difficult times, but I will not give too much’,” said Zhou Hao, analyst at Commerzbank in Singapore, adding that the PBOC’s targeted cut showed Beijing’s resolve to keep its debt level in check. Despite the policy boost, China’s major stock indexes still extended heavy losses.  The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent.     China’s currency, the yuan, dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. “Beijing has been sounding less dovish over the past two weeks. We believe a worsening of the trade conflict between the US and China will evoke another dovish turn by Beijing, especially on its monetary easing stance,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. Economists had expected further targeted cuts on the RRR this year as Beijing seeks to underpin growth. The State Council, or cabinet, said on April 17 that a policy framework would be set up to implement relatively low RRRs for small- and medium-sized banks. The PBOC is likely to cut RRRs for small banks to encourage more lending to small and private firms - which are vital for economic growth and job creation - policy insiders told Reuters previously, who penciled in at least one such “targeted” RRR cut this year. China’s Vice Premier Liu He, who was scheduled to meet U.S. officials in Washington for further trade talks this week, is “very unlikely” to go after Trump’s tariff “threat”, editor-in-chief of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Monday. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday a Chinese delegation is preparing to go to the United States for trade talks, although it did not say if Vice Premier Liu would be part of the delegation.

20,Malaysia sends ex-Goldman banker to U.S. to face 1MDB charges -report - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:54 AM / Updated 3 hours ago","3 Min ReadKUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Reuters) - Malaysia has extradited a former Goldman Sachs banker to the United States to face criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, The Edge financial daily reported on Monday, citing an unidentified source. Malaysian Roger Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds diverted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund. He left Goldman Sachs in 2014. Ng had agreed to be sent to the United States, but the proceedings were delayed after Malaysia’s home minister said he should first face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation. Malaysian and U.S. authorities, however, agreed last week to extradite Ng to the United States, The Edge reported. “I can confirm that he left last Friday and is now in the U.S. under the watch of the DoJ,” the daily quoted the source as saying. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. Ng’s lawyer was unavailable for comment. A prosecutor working on Ng’s case, who asked not to be identified as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said the attorney general would release a statement on Ng’s status soon. Goldman Sachs is under scrutiny for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. The DoJ has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used. Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales. He was also charged in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law targeting official bribery abroad. Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB funds. Leissner has pleaded guilty. Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak.

21,"RPT-WRAPUP 3-China stocks fall most in over 3 years on tariff threats, yuan tumbles - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  7:39 AM / in 3 hours","6 Min Read(Repeats to additional codes. No change to text.) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes fell the most in more than three years. The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Around 1,000 mainland firms plummet the maximum allowed 10 percent daily limit. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. The yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilise the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares have surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike in 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung.

22,Exclusive: Trump administration proposal would make it easier to deport immigrants who use public benefits - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:47 PM / 2 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering reversing long-standing policy to make it easier to deport U.S. legal permanent residents who have used public benefits, part of an effort to restrict immigration by low-income people. A Department of Justice draft regulation, seen by Reuters, dramatically expands the category of people who could be subject to deportation on the grounds that they use benefits.  Currently, those legal permanent residents who are declared to be a “public charge,” or primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, can be deported - but in practice, this is very rare.  The draft regulation would use a more expansive definition to include some immigrants who have used an array of public benefits, including cash welfare, food stamps, housing aid, or Medicaid. While the plan is at an early stage, might not become official government policy, and is likely to attract lawsuits, it is one part of efforts by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, in addition to its efforts to reduce illegal immigration to the United States.     The full possible impact is not known, but the change in policy could affect permanent residents - also known as “green card” holders - who are legally entitled to use public benefits soon after their arrival in the United States, such as refugees.     Department of Justice spokesman Alexei Woltornist said the agency “does not comment on or confirm draft regulations.” U.S. law allows for the deportation of immigrants who have become “public charges” within five years of admission if their reason for seeking help preceded their entry to the United States - for example, if they had a chronic health condition that was not disclosed. But due to a 1948 ruling, the deportation of immigrants for using public benefits has been strictly limited to cases in which the government has demanded payment for public services, and the person has failed to pay. Immigration lawyers said they have rarely if ever heard of someone being deported for using public benefits. The draft rule indicates the government would override that precedent to allow for deportation of some permanent residents who have used certain public benefits within five years of admission.  For the plan to go into effect, it would be subject to public comment, after which it could be revised. Attorney General William Barr would then have to sign off on it. The public benefits in question include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), given to disabled and older people; the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps; Section 8 housing vouchers; many Medicaid benefits; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a cash assistance program. According to federal policy, many permanent residents do not qualify for public benefits unless they have had a green card for five years, making it unlikely they could be targeted for deportation on the basis of “public charge” even under the draft rule. But dozens of states have looser rules - for instance, allowing pregnant women and children who are permanent residents to access Medicaid without a waiting period. And the effort to tighten the rules could affect thousands of immigrant veterans, refugees and asylees, who are eligible to receive many benefits without time restrictions. Active members of the military would not be affected. Administration officials had earlier indicated that the Justice Department, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, planned to issue a regulation on who can be deported for using public benefits, but its details were not previously known.      Immigrant advocates said the impact of the possible change is unclear, because it would be such a departure from long-standing practice. “We’re in new territory here because this has never been tested,” said Charles Wheeler, an attorney with the Catholic Legal Immigration Network non-profit group. “I’m concerned that it’s going to be targeted at permanent resident aliens who otherwise thought they were free and clear to receive SSI and other public benefit programs.”     The change, if implemented, fits with broader Trump administration efforts to squelch legal immigration by transforming public-charge rules. The administration has also slashed refugee admissions and imposed a broad travel ban on citizens of several mostly Muslim countries. The Justice Department’s draft proposal is based on a similar plan by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to significantly broaden the definition of what it means to be a public charge. While DHS can decide whether to grant or deny immigration benefits, DOJ’s immigration judges can also decide whether a resident ought to be deported. The DHS is expected soon to tighten regulations so that a “public charge” would be any foreigner “who receives one or more public benefits,” including an array of cash and non-cash benefits, such as food stamps, housing vouchers, and Medicaid.      The DOJ’s draft proposal mirrors that and also directs immigration judges to consider the use of public benefits as a heavily weighted negative factor when determining whether to admit a foreigner to the United States.     The State Department is also trying to restrict entry to the United States of people it suspects might use public benefits. Last year, it gave U.S. consular officers more discretion to reject visas for people they believe may become public charges. The number of people refused immigrant visas on public-charge grounds was four times higher in 2018 than in 2017, and the highest total since 2004. In addition to considering new standards for deporting legal residents, the DOJ is also looking at requiring foreigners seeking permanent residency status to submit a declaration to an immigration judge that demonstrates their self-sufficiency. The form asks for a detailed listing of assets, income, and debts, among other information.     Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Alistair BellAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Trump, in a series of tweets, also appeared to say that the two leaders had discussed U.S. investigations into alleged Russian interference in the American political system, including the 2016 presidential election, saying they had discussed “the ‘Russian Hoax’.” “Had a long and very good conversation with President Putin of Russia.

24,"Trump, Democrats cross swords over powers as 2020 election looms - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  5:22 PM / 2 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump are locked in a constitutional showdown over their powers to investigate him, exchanging threats that present risks for both sides as they head into the 2020 election. In a clash over the balance of power between the government’s legislative and executive branches, the Trump administration is stonewalling congressional investigators and asserting that it is within its rights to do so. On Capitol Hill, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, one of several senior Democrats leading probes of Trump, his presidency and his businesses, issued a dire warning: “The challenge we face is that the president of the United States wants desperately to prevent Congress, a co-equal branch of government, from providing any check whatsoever on even his most reckless decisions,” Nadler said in a hearing on Thursday.  “The very system of government in the United States, the system of limited power, the system of not having a president as a dictator is very much at stake.” His remarks came after Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, refused to attend the same hearing before Nadler’s committee, which is examining Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump’s efforts to stifle the probe.  In an unprecedented approach, Trump in recent days has filed lawsuits meant to block congressional subpoenas that were sent to two banks and an accounting firm that have worked with his businesses, which he did not divest when he took office. The subpoenas seek access to past financial records for Trump. A businessman-turned-politician, Trump also still refuses to disclose any of his annual tax returns, rejecting decades of practice by recent presidents. Standing by their president, Republicans in Congress dismissed as hollow Nadler’s rhetoric about Trump’s defiance and played down Barr’s refusal to attend the House hearing. The Republicans complained that Nadler wanted committee staff lawyers to be able to question Barr, a departure from the standard hearing format where lawmakers do the questioning.  They stressed Barr’s readiness to defend his handling of the Mueller report before a Republican-controlled Senate panel on the day before he skipped the House hearing. On Nadler’s comments, Republican Representative Tom Cole said, “It’s over the top. The attorney general showed up before the Senate committee and took every question.” The partisan shouting match in Washington is intensifying as a platoon of Democratic presidential hopefuls hit the campaign trail, with Trump lobbing Twitter insults at the front-runners. Both sides run risks in ramping up their confrontation. The Democrats could turn off voters if they push too hard to investigate, and perhaps ultimately try to impeach Trump, allowing him to play the victim, a role he excels in. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democrat in opinion polls, said this week that Trump’s stonewalling left no alternative but impeachment, which other Democrats have urged. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed the public split evenly over impeachment, with 40 percent in favor and 42 percent against it. On the other hand, Trump’s behavior may already be worrying Americans. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Trump with a 37 percent approval rating after the Mueller report’s release, his lowest of the year. [L1N2210EG] Any further erosion will likely be muted by the economy, which is churning along in its 10th year of expansion. But if economic growth were to falter, the stand-off in Washington could become a bigger issue ahead of the November 2020 election.   Mueller’s 448-page report, almost two years in the making, unearthed numerous links between Russians and Trump’s campaign, but concluded there was not enough evidence to establish that the campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow. It described attempts by Trump to obstruct Mueller’s probe, but stopped short of declaring that Trump had committed a crime. House Democrats are treating the report as a guide book for  more investigations. Shortly after its release in redacted form on April 18, Nadler subpoenaed an unredacted version, as well as the underlying evidence that informed it. Barr’s Justice Department has refused to comply and Nadler is weighing a contempt citation against Barr over the matter. In response to Nadler’s and other inquiries, Trump has dug in. In a letter obtained by Reuters, the White House argued that Trump is within his rights to order his advisers not to testify before Congress, even though he allowed them to cooperate with the Mueller investigation.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, accused Barr of lying to lawmakers about his interactions with Mueller. “That’s a crime,” she said. A Justice Department spokeswoman called Pelosi’s allegation “reckless, irresponsible and false.” Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on Nadler’s panel, said Democrats are resorting to hyperbole because the Mueller report did not land a knock-out legal blow on Trump. “If you don’t have the facts and you don’t have the law, the old joke is that you stand on the table and yell. Well, he’s just standing on the table and yelling now,” Collins said, referring to Nadler. Additional reporting by Sarah N.

26,European shares dive as U.S.-China tensions escalate - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:34 AM / in 3 hours","3 Min Read(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) May 6 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly ratcheted up trade tensions between the world’s largest economies by vowing to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by this week, prompting investors to flee riskier assets. Germany’s DAX – the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - and France’s CAC led declines, down 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. The pan-European STOXX 600 index shed 1.2 percent by 0720 GMT, its steepest fall in six weeks. Bourses in Italy, Spain and France also fell more than 1 percent while markets in Britain remained shut for a bank holiday. Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal have partly been the reason for the strong rally in equities this year, with most country indices recovering from a major rout last year and hitting multi-month highs. Oil prices slumped and Asian shares took a beating after Trump, in an unexpected move to mount pressure on China, said on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. Auto stocks’ 3 percent slump led broad based declines among European sectors. In a relatively light day for earnings, dealmaking was in focus. French energy major Total said it had reached a binding agreement with Occidental to acquire Anadarko assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa for a consideration of $8.8 billion. Telecom was another sector of interest as Norway’s Telenor said it is in negotiations with Malaysia’s Axiata Group to form a telecoms holding company. Telenor shares rose 3.8 percent. ThyssenKrupp lost 3.3 percent after the company said it still saw scope for agreement with European antitrust regulators on a planned joint venture with Tata Steel despite a report that Brussels was likely to block the deal. Chipmaker stocks AMS, STMicro and Siltronic , which are highly sensitive to trade war news, lost between 3.2 to 6.4 percent. Luxembourg-based auto supplier Stabilus slid after the company cut its full-year guidance on account of the ongoing weakness in the global auto industry. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday stepped up calls for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a cross-party deal to leave the European Union, following poor results for both parties in local elections on Thursday.

27,Yuan leads losers as global risk appetite sours - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:50 PM / Updated 3 hours ago","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan was set for its biggest drop in 10 months on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China while perceived safe-haven currencies such as the yen surged amid a broad-based rout for risky assets. In a surprise twist, Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, marking a big shift in tone from him. Trump had cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. That caught markets off guard, especially coming during a time of low market volatility across asset classes and a recent swathe of economic data that has indicated tepid but steady expansion of the global economy. “This has the potential to upset the global risk applecart especially after the recent calm in markets,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX & EM research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The Chinese currency led losers, falling nearly a percent to near its lowest levels this year around the 6.80 per dollar line. Both the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira fell by more than half a percent each. Other currencies, whose fortunes are closely linked to the Chinese economy, such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, declined between 0.3 to 0.5 percent. The selloff wasn’t limited to currencies alone, with a gauge of European equities down nearly 2 percent in early trading.  Moves were exaggerated with London markets out for a local holiday while Japanese markets remained shut. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. Away from the weakness in the Chinese yuan and other emerging market currencies such as the Turkish lira, the dollar was broadly stable against a basket of currencies. Investors weighed the prospects of a likely inflationary boost to the U.S. economy if Trump pressed ahead with higher tariffs on imported goods coinciding with growing expectations of a U.S. interest rate later in the year.

Some losses were recouped when the South China Morning Post reported China Vice-Premier Liu He would travel to Washington on Thursday after a delay, rather than cancelling planned talks altogether. However, the SCMP later said no decision had been made on the trip and it might indeed be cancelled, leaving the market guessing. In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump announced he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The Twitter message marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to the Middle East to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.720 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China was back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen before steadying to 123.93. The single currency was calm against the dollar at $1.1190, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.567. The dollar climbed 0.8 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.7825 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 5.8 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960 before steadying to $0.6994. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets,” he added. As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.5 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.2 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Simon Cameron-Moore)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday, and renewed the bid for safe haven assets. Global equity markets fell, with China’s main indexes down five percent, while Treasuries rallied after Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would rise on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, went negative for the first time since April 30, down 2.4 basis points on the day to -0.002 percent.

Italian government bonds underperformed the rest of the periphery with renewed concerns about the stability of the Italian government adding to worries about global trade. Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement raised pressure on its government partner, the League, on Sunday to dump a junior minister under investigation for corruption - a case that could pull the coalition apart. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said on Monday a graft case involving a junior minister from the ruling League party would trigger a government crisis only if the League itself pushed for it. Italy’s short-dated bonds were up to six basis points higher in early trade before pulling back as the session wore on, while the spread of its 10-year debt over Germany widened to nearly 260 basis points for the first time since April 30. The euro zone will report final service PMI numbers for April later in the session. March data showed business activity across the bloc to be lethargic, dipping to 51.6. A Reuters poll expects the April reading to come in at 51.3. On Friday the U.S. economy showed signs of sustained strength with job growth surging in April, while unemployment fell to the lowest in nearly 50 years. However, wage gains did not accelerate, and the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by people leaving the labour force. The report was supportive of the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon.

31,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares, oil drop after Trump tariff threat - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  6:20 AM / Updated 4 hours ago","6 Min Read* MSCI Asia ex-Japan sinks 1.9 pct * European shares seen following suit; London closed * Trump tweets tariff hike on Chinese goods due Friday * China blue-chips drop more than 6 pct despite targeted RRR cut * Safe-haven yen jumps, China’s yuan plummets * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Global financial markets reeled on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Equity markets, which have been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon, fell sharply as further talks to end their bruising trade war were thrown into doubt. The trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Chinese shares plunged more than 6 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 1.6 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan weakened sharply. The rout is set to continue in Europe. Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt’s DAX to open 1.7 percent lower at 12,207, and Paris’ CAC to open down 1.6 percent at 5,462. London is closed for a bank holiday. Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. Conflicting later reports on Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s travel plans added to market confusion. “I think this has got the potential to be a real game-changer,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets,” he said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.9 percent in afternoon trade as markets across the region fell deep into the red. Chinese blue-chips were down more than 6 percent, having closed higher before a three-day national holiday amid expectations that pressures on China’s economy were easing. The drop in Chinese shares came despite a move on Monday by China’s central bank to cut reserve requirements for small banks to help boost lending to small and private firms. Australian shares were off 0.8 percent. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures were down 1.9 percent at 22,075, off the day’s lows. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.6 percent, erasing memories of gains on Friday after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street, and signalling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. “The risk for (Trump) is that the Chinese don’t play ball and don’t go ahead with the negotiation,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. “It’s not in his interest for shares to go down as it would hit U.S. business confidence and investment, and that would shoot up unemployment. And that would be a risk for his re-election, too,” he said. But economists at Citi painted a brighter picture of the outlook for Chinese markets following the recent stabilisation of the Chinese economy. “Should trade tensions resume, we expect a speedy reaction by China’s policy-makers, with policy implementation made more effective. Given the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus is large in the near term, we believe the negative impact from additional tariffs will likely be managed better this time,” they said in a note. The flight from riskier assets boosted interest in safe havens, pushing U.S. Treasury futures up 16 ticks. Data from CME Group showed the market now sees a nearly 56 percent chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut by the end of the year. Chinese 10-year treasury futures also jumped, with the most-traded contract, for June delivery rising as much as  0.5 percent. They were last up 0.27 percent at 96.855. “The intensified trade and geopolitical risks are likely to prompt the regional central banks for more stimulatory policies,” analysts at ING said in a note. “We expect the majority of Asian central banks meeting this week to cut their policy rates.” As investors flocked to the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.3 percent against the Japanese currency to 110.78 . But China’s yuan plunged, with the offshore unit weakening to 6.8215 per dollar, its weakest level since January 10, before paring some losses. The onshore yuan weakened nearly 1 percent to 6.7980 per dollar before bouncing back to 6.7805. In contrast to the sharp moves in Asian currencies, the euro was down less than 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1193, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.06 percent at 97.579. In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.51 per barrel - still off 2.3 percent on the day. Brent crude was 2.2 percent lower at $69.28 per barrel. The tweets have compounded pressure on prices amid signs of a rise in U.S. output, which has surged by more than 2 million barrels per day since early 2018. Spot gold jumped 0.25 percent to trade at $1,282.20 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Additional reporting by Swati

33,"Trump ratchets up pressure on China, threatens tariff hikes - Reuters","May 5, 2019 /  4:57 PM / in 3 hours","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on China on Sunday to reach a trade deal, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon.  The move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled as negotiations were thrown into doubt. The Wall Street Journal reported that China was considering cancelling this week’s trade talks in Washington in light of Trump’s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise. A less than rosy update from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some previous commitments, prompted Trump’s decision. “The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Trump said in a tweet. U.S. officials did not weigh in on whether China would attend this week’s talks. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The atmosphere of the negotiations has changed,” said a Chinese official with knowledge of the situation.  Whether the talks would proceed and how they would proceed are issues that are now being re-evaluated, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  “All that depends on the attitude of the United States,” the official said.  The editor of an influential, Chinese state-run newspaper said Vice Premier Liu He was unlikely to go. “Let Trump raise tariffs. Let’s see when trade talks can resume,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the tabloid the Global Times, tweeted.  The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, but it is not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese media outlets have been told not to independently report on Trump’s overnight tweets or tweet about them, and instead adhere to any report from the official Xinhua news agency, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.  Global financial markets, which had been expecting news of a trade deal soon, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled, with China’s main indexes plunging 5 percent. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets.” Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate thanks to progress between the two sides. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly,” essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Mindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump suggested the measures were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. “The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,” he tweeted. Tariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by the companies importing the goods, and most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while supportive of Trump’s crackdown on China’s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded. “Raising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,” said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Nevertheless, the president’s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to “hang tough” in a tweet: “Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.” One Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence.  “The urgency is gone. So, it’s likely to see a longer trade war,” the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the topic. The trade war resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including autos, technology - and above all, agriculture, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Trump’s move could backfire, said Tai Hui, Asia-Pacific chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.  “As we learnt a year ago, Beijing could be willing to walk away if the U.S. applies negotiation tactics that they don’t agree with. That said, both sides have invested significant time and resources to come this far...” On Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the round in Beijing “productive,” and one White House official told Reuters that dates were being looked at for a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in June. Last week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, but a Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained. The increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday would be the first since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year.  Negotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be lifted, while Trump wants to keep some, if not all, of them as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.

34,"WRAPUP 2-China stocks, yuan tumble on Trump's fresh tariff threats - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  3:45 AM / Updated 5 hours ago","5 Min Read(Updates prices, add background) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes were heading for their worst daily loss in three years, with the blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index tumbling more than 5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. The yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar in early onshore trade, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilize the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co Ltd and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares had surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike in 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung.

35,Cracks appear in U.S. bipartisan unity on Venezuela - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  9:45 PM / in 3 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tough approach to Venezuela has won broad support from both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress, but this rare display of bipartisan consensus is starting to show signs of strain as the crisis in the OPEC nation drags on. Members of both parties remain in agreement that Venezuela’s socialist president Nicolas Maduro must go. They credit the Trump administration for helping to forge an international coalition that recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s interim president. But after Guaido’s latest calls for a military uprising and street protests failed to oust Maduro this week, some Democrats urged the administration to work more closely with foreign allies to choke off Maduro’s cash flow and to tone down its rhetoric, particularly threats of military action. Cracks in bipartisan cooperation on Venezuela - a rare bright spot for the Republican president, who has seldom drawn support for his policies from across the aisle - came amid signs of disappointment within the administration over what many had hoped would be a turning point in the crisis. More than three months after throwing U.S. support behind Guaido, head of the opposition-led National Assembly, Trump now has fewer levers to help pressure Venezuela’s military to abandon Maduro. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senator Bob Menendez, top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said Washington must work harder to convince foreign partners to back multilateral sanctions against Maduro. Few countries have matched harsh U.S. punitive measures against Venezuela’s vital oil sector and its banks. “The sanctions that we have are unilateral. They’re important,” Menendez told reporters. But the United States should “internationalize” those sanctions, he said. “Isolating Russia and Cuba, the bad actors, in Venezuela. I think that would have changed the dynamics significantly.” Most Western countries have backed Guaido, but Maduro retains the support of Venezuela’s major creditors Russia and China, as well as leftist regional allies like Cuba and Bolivia. Democratic Representative David Cicilline urged legislation to bar Trump from any military action without congressional approval. Under current laws, a U.S. president has broad powers to order military action. With Republicans controlling the Senate, new legislation to curb that power is unlikely in the short-term.  Cicilline also said administration officials should stop making statements that could be used as “propaganda” by Maduro’s supporters. The administration should “sort of dial back that kind of rhetoric,” he said at the House of Representatives. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States was prepared to act militarily in Venezuela “if that’s what’s required.” Just hours later, the Pentagon appeared to downplay any active preparations for military intervention, but acknowledged detailed contingency planning. A few Republicans see a role for the U.S. military. Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida said U.S. forces should be put in a position to help move aid convoys into Venezuela. However, there is deep skepticism whether Trump, who is trying to extract the United States from Syria and Afghanistan, is ready to commit to new foreign conflict. Most Latin American partners have already made clear they oppose the idea. “The United States is at its strongest and most legitimate when we are standing shoulder to shoulder with our Latin American and European allies,” said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski, a former State Department official. “So whatever we do going forward, stick with that approach.” He also called on the administration to temper its public pronouncements. “This is a genuine popular democratic uprising,” Malinowski told Reuters. “It’s not led by the United States. But we should not be saying things from Washington that create even the slightest impression to the contrary.” Guaido invoked the constitution in January to assume the interim presidency, arguing that Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking a coup. Venezuelans heeded a call from Guaido to take to the streets on Wednesday in a bid to force Maduro from power, but there was little indication of any change in what looks increasingly like a political stalemate. Asked whether he was disappointed with the outcome, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who has played a key role in pushing Trump’s anti-Maduro approach, told Reuters: “No, because I think it’s a mistake to view it as a one-day event.” U.S. officials said on Tuesday that three top Maduro loyalists purportedly had been in negotiations with the opposition to turn against Maduro but then reneged. Maduro and key military figures made a show of unity in a television broadcast on Thursday.

36,Democrat Inslee tries to separate from pack with campaign climate plan - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:23 PM / in 3 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington Governor Jay Inslee on Friday outlined a plan to achieve 100% clean electricity, zero-emission new vehicles and zero-carbon buildings and retire the U.S. coal power plant fleet by 2030, aiming to position himself as the most aggressive Democratic candidate on climate change. Inslee, who has focused his 2020 presidential bid on combating climate change, laid out his ambitious platform on Friday just days after campaign rival Beto O’Rourke unveiled his own climate policy, which calls for net-zero emissions by 2050. Inslee said he modeled his plan after some of the policies he has implemented as governor of Washington state. He described it as a 10-year mobilization to take on an urgent crisis. “We can and must build an economy free from fossil fuels, and that is what I’m proposing today,” Inslee said in a statement. The plan would begin with a series of executive actions that would set aggressive targets to achieve in 2030. Inslee said he would implement the steps from his first day in office. The targets include requiring all new light and medium duty vehicles and buses and all commercial and residential buildings to be zero-emission. By 2035, Inslee said electricity generation would be sourced entirely from renewable and zero emission sources.  This would include the retirement of the U.S. coal fleet by 2030, similar to the policy he implemented in Washington state. Large renewable energy projects would be deployed on federal lands. The plan reflects many principles of the Green New Deal, a bold set of policy goals introduced by congressional Democrats and pushed for by youth activists. The goal is to transform the U.S. energy economy to 100 percent renewable sources by 2030 with a boost from federal investments modern infrastructure and green job programs. Green New Deal activists and authors on Friday embraced Inslee’s proposal, and were more wary of the proposal O’Rourke unveiled earlier in the week. Inslee’s plan “rightly acknowledges the scale and urgency of the climate crisis and puts forth aggressive sector specific targets and implementation mechanisms to meet it, including the plainly stated commitment to end the era of coal,” said Greg Carlock, an author who works for think tank Data for Progress.  Most of the Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have embraced some goals of the Green New Deal. Republicans have attacked the plan, calling it unfeasible. Reporting by Valerie  Volcovici; Editing by David GregorioAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

37,Maine Senate rejects ending religious exemptions for vaccinations - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  8:57 PM / 3 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - An effort to end all non-medical exemptions for childhood vaccinations in Maine was in limbo on Thursday after the state Senate voted to amend it to allow parents to keep opting out on religious grounds. The bill had passed the Democratic-controlled state House of Representatives last month, making Maine one of at least seven states considering ending non-medical exemptions amid the worst outbreak of measles in the United States in 25 years.  In a close vote, 18 lawmakers in the Democratic-led state Senate supported an amendment to the House bill to retain the religious exemption that exists in state law, while 17 voted against. The senators approved ending exemptions for children whose parents oppose vaccination for “philosophical reasons.” Several senators who had trained and worked as doctors argued at length ahead of the vote to allow an exemption only if a healthcare provider deemed it medically necessary. Others noted no major U.S. religion opposes vaccinations. Senator Linda Sanborn, a Democrat who has practiced family medicine, said the bill was to prevent “an impending disaster” in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Five percent of Maine’s kindergarten students have non-medical exemptions from vaccination, compared with a national average of 2 percent. She said other fatal diseases could follow the fate of smallpox, which was globally eradicated through vaccination efforts, adding: “It takes a community caring about not just ourselves but our neighbors to make this happen.” Senate Republicans, including Scott Cyrway, opposed the bill as government overreach into the private sphere. “We’re forcing someone to do something when we don’t really have to,” Cyrway said. In neighboring Vermont, lawmakers voted in 2015 to remove philosophical exemptions while leaving in place religious ones. As a result, more parents sought and received those exemptions - 3.9 percent in 2017, up from 0.9 percent in 2015, according to the state’s Department of Health. In Maine, the amended bill will go back to the House, which can vote either to accept or reject the amendment. If both chambers cannot agree, the bill dies. A spokeswoman for the House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. There have been no measles cases in Maine since 2007, but officials have worried about recent outbreaks of whooping cough, another childhood disease for which there is a mandatory vaccination. Only three states have outlawed any non-medical exemptions for vaccinations - California, Mississippi and West Virginia.

38,"FOREX-Yen gains, yuan skids as Trump springs China trade shock - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  5:30 AM / Updated 5 hours ago","4 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading, yuan slips * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * SCMP reports China’s He will go to Washington on Thursday * U.S. and Nikkei stock futures skid, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen climbed and the yuan slid on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, sending stocks and commodities into a tailspin. Some losses were recouped when the South China Morning Post reported China Vice-Premier Liu He would travel to Washington on Thursday after a delay, rather than cancelling planned talks altogether. However, the SCMP later said no decision had been made on the trip and it might indeed be cancelled, leaving the market guessing. In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump announced he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The Twitter message marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to the Middle East to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.81 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China was back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen before steadying to 123.96. The single currency was calm against the dollar at $1.1191, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.549. The dollar climbed 0.9 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.7921 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 5.7 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960 before steadying to $0.6986. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets,” he added. As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.1 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Simon Cameron-Moore)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

39,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares, oil plunge after Trump vows China tariff hike - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  5:00 AM / in 6 hours","6 Min Read* MSCI Asia ex-Japan sinks 2 pct * Trump tweets tariff hike on Chinese goods due Friday * China blue-chips drop more than 6 pct despite targeted RRR cut * Safe-haven yen jumps, China’s yuan plummets * Markets see higher chance of further easing * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Global financial markets reeled on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Equity markets, which have been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon, fell sharply as further talks to end their bruising trade war were thrown into doubt. The trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Chinese shares plunged more than 5 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 2 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan weakened sharply. Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. “I think this has got the potential to be a real game-changer,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets,” he said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 2 percent as markets across the region fell deep into the red. Chinese blue-chips lost more than 6 percent at one point in the morning session, having closed higher before a three-day national holiday amid expectations that pressures on China’s economy were easing. They later clawed back some losses, and finished the morning session down 5.5 percent. The drop in Chinese shares came despite a move on Monday by China’s central bank to cut reserve requirements for small banks to help boost lending to small and private firms. Australian shares were off 0.9 percent. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures were down 2.3 percent at 21,965. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.9 percent, erasing memories of gains on Friday after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street and signalling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. “The risk for (Trump) is that the Chinese don’t play ball and don’t go ahead with the negotiation,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. “It’s not in his interest for shares to go down as it would hit U.S. business confidence and investment, and that would shoot up unemployment. And that would be a risk for his re-election, too,” he said. But economists at Citi painted a brighter picture of the outlook for Chinese markets following the recent stabilisation of the Chinese economy. “Should trade tensions resume, we expect a speedy reaction by China’s policy-makers, with policy implementation made more effective. Given the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus is large in the near term, we believe the negative impact from additional tariffs will likely be managed better this time,” they said in a note. The flight from riskier assets boosted interest in safe havens, pushing U.S. Treasury futures up 22 ticks. Data from CME Group showed the market now sees a nearly 59 percent chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut by the end of the year. Chinese 10-year treasury futures also jumped, with the most-traded contract, for June delivery rising as much as  0.5 percent. They were last up 0.26 percent at 96.850. “The intensified trade and geopolitical risks are likely to prompt the regional central banks for more stimulatory policies,” analysts at ING said in a note. “We expect the majority of Asian central banks meeting this week to cut their policy rates.” As investors flocked to the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.4 percent against the Japanese currency to 110.61 . But China’s yuan plunged, with the offshore unit weakening to 6.8215 per dollar, its weakest level since January 10, before paring some losses. The onshore yuan weakened nearly 1 percent to 6.7980 per dollar before bouncing back to 6.7832. In contrast to the sharp moves in Asian currencies, the euro was down less than 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1193, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 97.519. In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.44 per barrel - still off 2.4 percent on the day. Brent crude was 2.2 percent lower at $69.26 per barrel The tweets have compounded pressure on prices amid signs of a rise in U.S. output, which has surged by more than 2 million barrels per day since early 2018.

40,"Funds dig deeper into bearish CBOT bets as heavy stocks, trade war weigh: Braun - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  4:32 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","6 Min ReadFORT COLLINS, Colo. (Reuters) - Heavy world stocks, trade conflicts, and demand disruptions have led speculators to end April on a record bearish note across Chicago-traded grains and oilseeds, and a sharp reversal in investor attitude anytime soon seems unlikely.  When combining money managers' net positions in CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, along with Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat, the overall net short reached 683,501 futures and options contracts as of April 30, up from 656,078 a week prior, which was the previous record. (tmsnrt.rs/2LqH2DO)  The agriculture market has been grappling with record U.S. soybean stocks and rising corn stocks, an excellent U.S. wheat crop, and strong export competition among major world suppliers for all three products. Feed demand in China, which imports massive quantities of soybeans for its hog herd, has recently been disappointing as the country is battling an outbreak of deadly African swine fever.  Market participants have been hopeful that a potential trade resolution between the United States and China might be able to cure tumbling CBOT futures, but those hopes were blasted on Sunday as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions by saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. This comes after many months of headlines saying the trade talks were going well and that a resolution could be reached soon. Beijing was unimpressed with Trump’s ideas and as of late Sunday night, China’s Vice Premier Liu He was considering cancelling his planned trip to the United States this week to continue trade talks.  Markets reacted harshly to this news. Early in overnight trade from Sunday to Monday, July corn futures were down as much as 15 cents per bushel and July soybeans dropped up to 20 cents.  Drier forecasts for the U.S. Corn Belt heading into mid-month also weighed on futures overnight. Heavy, persistent rains have halted a large portion of U.S. fieldwork, causing concerns that the corn crop may not get planted to full intentions.  In the week ended April 30, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short position in CBOT corn futures and options to 306,699 contracts from a record 322,215 in the prior week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPjxhe)  On the other end of the spectrum, producers cut their net long in corn to 12,527 futures and options contracts from a record 47,097 a week earlier. This is only the fourth week ever, and fourth in a row, that producers held a bullish stance in the yellow grain, and this continues to cap rally potential should funds decide to cover their short positions.  Wet weather across the U.S. Corn Belt has delayed the planting of the crop in many key states such as Illinois. This led to a modest rise in CBOT corn futures from Wednesday through Friday, and commodity funds were presumed to be straight buyers of the grain during that time.  Meanwhile, funds were likely straight sellers of CBOT soybean futures over the last three sessions. Significant planting delays for U.S. corn can often lead to a rise in soybean plantings, which along with the U.S.-China trade war and record stockpiles did not create positive sentiments among investors. Through April 30, money managers' net short in soybeans hit a new record of 148,526 futures and options contracts. That compares with 129,566 contracts in the previous week, and that was a record at the time. (tmsnrt.rs/2DQMhq2) Similar to corn, producers are loaded up on soybeans, which would not be supportive of a drastic futures rally should fundamentals unexpectedly turn positive. Producers’ net long in soybean futures and options rose to 69,145 contracts from 63,510 a week earlier. The new position is about 10,000 contracts below producers’ record net long.  Funds also hit new record bearish bets in Kansas City wheat futures and options through April 30. The net short of 58,494 contracts is up from 53,673 in the previous week and tops the old record of 54,295 contracts set two weeks earlier. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPk2I8)  K.C. July wheat futures rose nearly 2 percent over the last three sessions after Tuesday’s contract lows, but they had fallen back down near those lows early in Sunday night’s trading.  Money managers extended their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 83,502 contracts through April 30, their most bearish wheat view in 15 months. They also added 43 futures and options contracts to their net short in Minneapolis wheat, which hit 12,609 contracts. That is funds’ most bearish spring wheat stance since July.  Speculators’ moves in the soy complex through April 30 were not very dramatic. Money managers extended their net short in soybean oil to 58,072 futures and options contracts from 50,637 in the previous week, and they cut their net short in soybean meal to 15,599 contracts from 19,429 a week earlier. Trade sources predict that commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT wheat, net sellers of soybean meal, and straight sellers of soybean oil between Wednesday and Friday.

41,Occidental tweaks $38 billion Anadarko bid to remove shareholder vote - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  6:59 PM / Updated 7 hours ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Sunday, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. The move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid, including T Rowe Price, will not get an opportunity to vote it down. It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko, but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Anadarko confirmed that it received the revised bid from Occidental and said its board will review the proposal. The merger agreement with Chevron remains in effect, Anadarko said and reaffirmed its existing recommendation of the deal with Chevron at this time. Earlier on Sunday, France’s Total SA said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion, should the two U.S. oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine. This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non-core to the deal. On Tuesday, Occidental also secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko. The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors.  Occidental submitted a new $76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, as opposed to an even cash/stock split in its $76 per share offer previously.  This brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders. Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal. The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques. “The financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms. However, a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko’s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted, Occidental added. Should Occidental’s bid be declared superior by Anadarko, Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental’s offer, according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko. Should Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee. The proposed sale of Anadarko’s African assets to Total includes a 26.5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which is moving closer to a final investment decision, and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana. Occidental said this does not impact the planned $2 billion of annual cost savings and $1.5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko. Total’s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal, the French company said in a separate statement. Chevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its $65-a-share bid. Separately, Occidental said its first-quarter adjusted profit fell 10.9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue. Adjusted profit fell to $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $708 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Production rose 18 percent to 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, Occidental said. Its Permian Resources unit saw output rising 47 percent year-over-year to 261,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

45,"FOREX-Yen firms, yuan falls as Trump escalates China trade war - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  2:13 AM / in 9 hours","4 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading, yuan skids * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * Reports China considering cancelling talks in Washington * U.S. and Nikkei stock futures skid, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen climbed and the yuan slid on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China and Beijing was reported to be considering cancelling talks planned for this week, sending riskier assets into a spin. Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Beijing might cancel talks with their U.S. counterparts in Washington planned for Wednesday. CNBC followed with a report that China would “likely” cancel the trip. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.53 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China is back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen and was last at 123.56. The single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.1191, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.519. The dollar climbed 1 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.8007 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 4 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last down at $0.6982. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.9 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 20 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.2 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Sam Holmes)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

46,Fed faces tough sell on inflation framework - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  9:02 PM / Updated 9 hours ago","6 Min ReadPALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers fear they are ill-equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation-targeting approach, and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs. But for the U.S. central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in Palo Alto Friday to discuss available options, the challenge was clear: not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits, figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge. Indeed, just to explain their ideas to each other, Fed policymakers and academics at the Hoover Institution’s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations, lengthy bullet points, and nearly indecipherable charts. And while most of the PhD economists in the audience presumably understood the theories, “I think where people disagree is, do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life?” Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. In other words, what will really work? When central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they thought they were facing once-in-a-lifetime conditions.  But a decade on from the end of the Great Recession, it’s clear the Fed is dealing with a new economic norm. Neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with U.S. unemployment at a near 50-year low.  That leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had.  So this year, with the U.S. economy on an even keel, interest rate policy on pause, and an expansion set to reach record length this summer, Fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along.  Among the ideas: commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above-target inflation; target economic output, rather than inflation directly; and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns.  All would, their advocates say, act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions.  Each would differ, to greater or lesser degrees, from the Fed’s current approach, by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment. And all would depend critically on households, businesses and financial markets understanding the framework, and reacting accordingly. Average inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far. The idea, New York Fed President John Williams explained, is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period - say, a year and a half.  When inflation falls during periods of economic stress, the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time.  If households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future, they will borrow and spend more during recessions, which would theoretically speed the economy’s return to health. But for the plan to work, spenders will have to believe the Fed really will drive inflation higher in the future. By contrast, negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy; if they just keep their money at the bank, they’ll end up paying for the privilege. For such a regime to be accepted, however, ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn’t be punished as well.  Fed policymakers have largely rejected negative rates, but some central banks have tried it and academics like Harvard University professor Kenneth Rogoff, who presented his work at the Hoover conference, maintain it is a viable option. Not everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework, not even the Fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas.   “The bar for change is high,” San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly said. “It can be costly to make mistakes in this space.” St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard has long advocated a framework known as nominal GDP targeting where the Fed would target a specific level of economic output rather than prices directly.  But even as he gave a new pitch for the idea, he expressed trepidation with such a radical change: experimenting with the way the world’s biggest central bank does business, he said, could “unleash chaos” in global financial markets.   One of the challenges of selling a new framework is that for the past 10 years, central banks globally have failed to deliver on their current 2-percent inflation targets, the prevailing international standard.  To Cleveland Fed’s Mester, having a set of rules, whatever they may be, could make policy more effective by making it easier for people to understand the aims, and limits, of Fed actions. And Fed policymakers in Palo Alto seemed keen on exploring new ideas. The Fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year. Most in the audience gave the Fed credit for tackling the issue.

48,"Facebook bans Alex Jones, other extremist figures - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  11:05 PM / in 3 days","4 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Thursday it was banning Alex Jones and other controversial U.S. political personalities for violating the social media company’s policies on “dangerous individuals and organizations.” Most of the individuals whose accounts are being removed are popular figures on the far right, including commentators Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer and Paul Joseph Watson. Facebook also said it is banning Paul Nehlen, an avowed white supremacist who ran for Congress in 2018, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has preached black separatism and referred to Jews as “termites.” The company will remove any accounts, pages, groups and events associated with the banned individuals, both on its core social network and its photo-sharing app Instagram. It says it bans any users who promote violence or hate. However, Facebook stopped short of prohibiting other users from praising or supporting the banned individuals on its platforms, as it has done for militant groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the past. Hours after his account disappeared, videos of Louis Farrakhan were still visible on Instagram among the 17,000 posts with the hashtag #louisfarrakhan, including a video where he defends his descriptions of Jews. “If it is truth, then it is not anti-Semitic,” he says in the clip. Facebook announced the ban before removing the affected accounts, giving the account owners time to redirect their thousands of followers to other channels before the accounts disappeared, as captured in screen shots by BuzzFeed journalist Ryan Mac. Alex Jones, who has promoted conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook school shooting and hosted Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes on his show, quickly opened a new account and live-streamed himself talking about the ban, CNBC reported. Infowars, the website run by Jones, posted a response saying that the ban “... amounts to editorial control over user content - and a donation in kind to the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate.” Social media companies have an uneasy history with voices on the far right, struggling for years to decide how to handle extremist content even as its purveyors used the services to amass followers and catapult themselves into the mainstream. The result has often been haphazard enforcement of policies: Facebook removed pages associated with Jones and his Infowars website starting last year, but left up his personal profile, for example. Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Twitter also banned Infowars last year. The companies have faced backlash over their suspensions of accounts from conservatives, who accuse them of censorship and bias. Civil rights groups say social media giants have failed to confront extremism. Facebook says it enforces its rules without prejudice. It tightened those policies further last month with a decision to ban praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism. “We’ve always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today,” the company said in a statement. Liberal media watchdog group Media Matters for America praised the move, saying it inspired “some optimism that [Facebook] might be capable of taking responsibility for the ways its platforms have empowered extremists.” Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

53,Rice Energy founder to drop lawsuit against energy producer EQT - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:35 PM / in 10 hours","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Toby Rice, the co-founder of Rice Energy, which was acquired by EQT Corp in 2017, said in a statement on Sunday he would drop his lawsuit against EQT after the U.S. oil and gas producer said it was not seeking to manipulate the outcome of his board challenge. Rice and his brother Derek have put forward a slate of nominees to challenge EQT’s board in a shareholder vote in July, arguing EQT has mismanaged the $6.7 billion acquisition of their company to the detriment of EQT investors. In a lawsuit last month, Rice also accused EQT of seeking to mislead its shareholders by portraying his board nominees as endorsing EQT’s existing board, and presenting their election as triggering covenants that would require EQT to repay early or refinance its debt. In a letter on Sunday to its management, EQT said the lawsuit was a distraction without merit, calling it “a tactic intended to distract focus from the company’s strong first quarter financial results and outstanding recent operational performance.” EQT said the Rice team had misinterpreted a “standard form director and officer questionnaire” and that it would not seek to conflate its board directors with the Rice nominees. It added it had no intention of triggering change of control provisions that would have required a debt refinancing or early repayment. In response, the Rice team said in its statement it was pleased “EQT has conceded that it must withdraw its unreasonable requirements” and that it was “deeply disappointed” that a lawsuit was needed to address the issue. The Rice team is continuing with its effort to overthrow EQT’s board. Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy. Despite its new scale, EQT’s share price has lagged since the merger, spurring the Rice brothers to call for changes. How the company develops its assets is at the heart of the dispute. The Rice brothers insist the current management has not fulfilled EQT’s potential, while the company insists the siblings’ projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions.

55,UPDATE 1-Wall St futures plunge after Trump threatens China with further tariffs - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:55 AM / in 10 hours","3 Min Read(Updates prices, adds commentary) By Sinéad Carew May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock index futures fell sharply in a volatile session on Sunday evening after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and soon target hundreds of billions more. After easing losses for a while, U.S. futures lost more ground and hit a fresh session low after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was considering canceling a round of U.S. talks set for this week because of Trump’s comments. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” Investors pulled back from riskier bets on fears the trade battle between the world’s biggest economies was escalating, especially since recent gains in U.S. equities were at least partly due to optimism they would reach a deal. “I think the president feels China is dragging its feet,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “He’s trying to pressure China into a deal. It’s a stupid move. The Chinese are going to be thinking this is negotiating in a bad faith way.” After falling as much as 1.92% on the prospect that China would cancel meetings, S&P futures then steadied slightly. S&P 500 e-minis were down 54.75 points, or 1.86%, with 175,429 contracts changing hands. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 168 points, or 2.14%, in volume of 46,116 contracts and Dow e-minis were down 484 points, or 1.83%, with 26,617 contracts changing hands. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut said China’s reaction to Trump’s would be the next big catalyst for investors who may see the President’s comments as a negotiating tactic. “The next important thing is the reaction from China. Should China cancel the trip that becomes a bigger problem. People came into this weekend expecting there was a good chance we’d have a trade deal next Friday,” said O’Rourke. “A deal with China has already been essentially priced in, if not fully. A large portion of the market will give the situation the benefit of the doubt to see what China’s reaction is. If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.” The S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. “I do think it’s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,” said Rick Meckler, Partner, Cherry Lane Investments,  New Vernon, New Jersey.

U.S. President Donald Trump sharply escalated trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that talks toward a trade deal with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of robust growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. “President Trump just killed the trade deal for a while and that has implications for Chinese and global growth, it also has implications for a number of assets,” Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro said in a morning note to clients. In early Asian trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent. Australian shares were 0.6 percent lower in early trade. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures dropped 1.8 percent to 22,085. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street stocks on Friday. Investors around Asia will be keeping an eye on Chinese markets, which open at 0130 following a three-day national holiday last week. With an imminent trade deal on hold, Treasury futures jumped 14 ticks. Data from CME Group showed the market sees a nearly 58 percent chance of a Fed rate cut by the end of the year. As investors flocked to the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.4 percent against the Japanese currency to 110.67 . But China’s offshore yuan plunged, weakening to 6.8108 per dollar, its weakest level since January 23. The single currency was down 0.18 percent on the day at $1.1180. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up at 97.574. In commodity markets, U.S. crude plunged 2.15 percent at $60.61 a barrel and Brent crude fell 1.78 percent to $69.59 per barrel. Spot gold jumped 0.4 percent to trade at $1,283.65 per ounce.

57,"FOREX-Yen firms, yuan falls as Trump China tariff threat jolts markets - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  12:19 AM / Updated 11 hours ago","4 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading, yuan skids * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * Report China considering cancelling talks in Washington * U.S. and Nikkei stock futures slip, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen climbed and the yuan slid on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China, sending riskier assets into a spin and slamming stock futures. Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he will hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Beijing might cancel talks with their U.S. counterparts in Washington planned for Wednesday. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.65 yen on the WSJ report. Earlier it touched a five-week trough at 110.53 on Reuters dealing, after ending Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China is back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.44 yen and was last at 123.75. The single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.1185, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 97.548. The dollar climbed 1 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.8038 . The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last down at $0.6972. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2 percent at 22,050, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings was seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared to the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Andrea Ricci & Kim Coghill)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

59,"FOREX-Yen firms, yuan falls as Trump China tariff threat jolts risk assets - Reuters","May 5, 2019 /  11:48 PM / in 11 hours","3 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * U.S. and Nikkei stock futures slip, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen climbed in Asia on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China, sending riskier assets into a spin and slamming stock futures. Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he will hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chinese officials are scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” Investors responded by bidding up the yen which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar initially fell to a five-week trough at 110.53 on Reuters dealing, having ended Friday around 111.12. It was last at 110.83, with the market again thin as Japan remains on holiday. The euro hit its lowest since January at 123.44 yen , before steadying around 124.00. The single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.1192, while the dollar index was a fraction softer at 97.502. The dollar did gain on the Chinese yuan, firming 0.75 percent to 6.7830. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last holding at $0.6992. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.4 percent in early trade and Treasury futures jumped 14 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2 percent at 22,035, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings was seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.230 percent by December compared to the current effective rate of 2.40 percent.

60,UPDATE 1-U.S. stock futures tumble after Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  11:24 PM / in 12 hours","3 Min Read(Updates with price update, commentary, background) By Sinéad Carew May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock index futures fell sharply on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and soon target hundreds of billions more. Trump’s announcement came ahead of another round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Washington scheduled for this week. White House officials were unaware on Sunday afternoon if Trump’s tweet would affect those talks. The Chinese delegation could decide not to come because of what is likely to be seen as an escalation by the president. Investors were taking risk off the table on concerns that Trump’s threat would halt progress in talks between the world’s biggest economies, especially since some recent gains in U.S. equities were due to optimism they would reach a deal. “It’s obviously not good news for the market. The administration had sent signals an agreement was close before. This causes us to question how close we are,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. While S&P futures eased their losses they were still down on as the evening wore on. After falling as much as 1.8%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 40 points, or 1.36%, with 93,139 contracts changing hands. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 119 points, or 1.51%, in volume of 21,736 contracts and Dow e-minis were down 358 points, or 1.35%, with 14,154 contracts changing hands. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut said investors may not panic completely yet as they could see Trump’s comments as a negotiating tactic. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we catch a bounce between now and tomorrow morning. With the president it could be a negotiating tactic,” said O’Rourke. If this week’s scheduled meetings were canceled, pressure on equities could ramp up, he said. “The next important thing is the reaction from China. Should China cancel the trip that becomes a bigger problem. People came into this weekend expecting there was a good chance we’d have a trade deal next Friday,” said O’Rourke. “A deal with China has already been essentially priced in, if not fully. A large portion of the market will give the situation the benefit of the doubt to see what China’s reaction is. If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.” The S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. “I do think it’s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,” said Cherry Lane’s Meckler.

61,"With a wing and a drumstick, Democrat uses poultry props to chide Barr - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  2:30 PM / in 4 days","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Attorney General William Barr refused to appear at a hearing in the U.S. Congress on Thursday, one Democrat decided it was thigh time to act against what he saw as fowl behavior.  Congressman Steve Cohen arrived at a hearing of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee carrying a bucket of fried chicken and a poultry figurine. He said the props represented the nation’s top law enforcement official, who canceled his planned testimony amid a dispute over the hearing format. “The chicken Barr should have shown up today and answered questions,” the Tennessee Democrat told reporters, after he handed out pieces of fried chicken to other committee members. After the hearing concluded, committee staffers wiped up chicken grease from the area around Cohen’s seat.  Democrats accuse Barr and other administration officials of stonewalling their investigations into Trump’s taxes, his businesses and other topics. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said on Thursday that he may hold Barr in contempt of Congress if the attorney general does not turn over an unredacted copy of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

62,Congress displays political art of the empty chair after Barr no-show - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  3:18 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Political theater sometimes calls for props. On Thursday Democrats on the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee pulled out a classic: the empty chair.  When U.S. Attorney General William Barr failed to show up for a committee hearing to testify about his handling of the Mueller report, Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler convened the hearing anyway. At the center of the room was a long witness table with a folded placard bearing Barr’s name. Behind that was a single empty chair, all neatly arranged for the cameras.   Barr canceled his scheduled appearance after clashing with Nadler over the format of the hearing. Democrats are now weighing whether to hold Barr in contempt. It wasn’t the first time - nor likely the last - that politicians rolled out a vacant chair to try to make a point.  In 2018, the Senate Intelligence Committee convened a hearing on election meddling by foreign state-sponsored agents and Google opted not participate. The committee set out an empty chair In 2017, Trump convened a meeting with then-House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that set out an empty seat for Nancy Pelosi, who was then the House minority leader.  “His empty chair photo opp showed he’s more interested in stunts than in addressing the needs of the American people. Poor Ryan and McConnell relegated to props,” Pelosi wrote on Twitter at the time. Actor and director Clint Eastwood famously bombed with his attempt at an empty chair routine during the 2012 Republican National Convention.  Eastwood, who backed Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s bid for president, brought an empty chair on stage for an imagined conversation with then Democratic President Barack Obama. Critics at the time said the routine made little sense and only generated confusion.  At other times, lawmakers have opted to skip the empty chair and go straight to contempt. In 2012, House Republicans voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for refusing to comply with their investigation to the botched “Fast and Furious” weapons program.  In that fight, Obama invoked executive privilege and ultimately Holder’s Justice Department opted not to prosecute him in response to Congress’s contempt vote.

Parties that had initially expressed interest in Jet, which is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of debt, have so far failed to come forward with firm bids to bail it out, increasing odds that it could soon face bankruptcy proceedings. “There is little scope in the revival of Jet,” said one official, adding that if a bidder emerged, the government was still willing to restore slots to the private airline that had been temporarily given to rivals. The second official said it was only a matter of time before someone dragged the carrier to the National Company Law Tribunal - India’s bankruptcy court - for recovery of dues.

66,Turkey says it will not bow to U.S. sanctions over S-400 deal - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:47 AM / Updated 18 hours ago","3 Min ReadANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will never bow to U.S. sanctions over its agreement to purchase Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense systems, Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Sunday regarding a deal that has strained ties between the NATO allies. Washington says the systems are not compatible with NATO equipment and may compromise its Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets. It has warned of possible U.S. sanctions if Ankara pushes on with the Russian deal.  Turkey, a prospective buyer and a partner in the production of the F-35s, has said the S-400s and jets would not impact each other and that it will not abandon its deal with Russia.  It has proposed forming a working group with Washington to assess the impact of the S-400s, but says it has not received a response yet. Speaking to broadcaster Kanal 7, Oktay said the U.S. concerns are unreasonable and that the planned July delivery date for the S-400s remained unchanged. “When Turkey signs an agreement, Turkey keeps its promise. We signed this agreement and certain payments were made,” Oktay said. “I don’t think the arguments and concerns here have a lot to lean on,” he said. The United States has also offered to sell Turkey its rival Raytheon Co. Patriot defense systems, which Turkey’s Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara was still evaluating. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will visit Turkey next week, told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency on Sunday that decisions about defense procurement were up to individual countries. “The issue of procuring military materiel is a national decision for countries, but the ability of allied armies to work together is a fundamental issue for NATO to run its operations and missions,” Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. He said he welcomed talks between Ankara and Washington on the procurement of the Patriot systems and talks between Turkey and the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium on its SAMP-T systems. In March Reuters reported Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, angered by Ankara’s refusal to back down from its planned purchase of the Russian missile system. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that the F-35 project would collapse if Turkey did not participate. Turkey has said it expected U.S. President Donald Trump to use a waiver to protect it against penalties over the S-400s, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ankara could face retribution for the deal under the U.S. Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

67,Turkey board to rule on Istanbul election re-run appeal -AKP candidate - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:22 AM / a day ago","2 Min ReadANKARA, May 5 (Reuters) - A ruling on an appeal by Turkey’s AK Party (AKP) calling for a re-run of the Istanbul mayoral election will be made on Monday by the High Election Board (YSK), the AKP’s candidate said. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) won control of the capital Ankara and Istanbul, the country’s biggest city, for the first time in 25 years in March 31 local elections. President Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP and their nationalist MHP allies have called for the results in Istanbul to be annulled and re-run citing what they say are irregularities. The YSK has ordered recounts across Istanbul and in its interim ruling it ordered district electoral officials to inspect their respective polling station officials. “The YSK has examined our party’s and the MHP’s objections to the Istanbul election results. I believe it will make a decision tomorrow,” said AKP candidate Binali Yildirim, a former prime minister. He spoke to reporters after morning prayers on Sunday, the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. On Saturday, Erdogan signalled he favours a re-run of the Istanbul elections, which he said were marred by controversy and irregularities, adding that renewing the vote would allow the YSK to “clear its name”. Istanbul’s new CHP mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said on Saturday that the objections were unreasonable and that they could “only laugh at this”. CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has said the Istanbul elections had turned into a test for Turkish democracy. Erdogan had accused the opposition of supporting “terrorism” and labeled the local election a “matter of survival” for Turkey during his campaign, which was held amid growing disenchantment among voters over economic woes. The uncertainty over the results in Istanbul, which accounts for around a third of the country’s economy, has kept financial markets on edge, as Turkey tries to recover from a currency crisis that saw the lira lose more than 30 percent of its value last year.

68,Egypt non-oil private-sector activity expands for first time in 8 months -PMI - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  4:16 AM / in a day","3 Min ReadCAIRO, May 5 (Reuters) - Egypt’s non-oil private-sector activity expanded for the first time in eight months in April, and saw its highest reading since August 2015, a survey showed on Sunday. The Emirates NBD Egypt Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the non-oil private sector strengthened to 50.8 in April from 49.9 in March, breaching the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time since August last year. The April reading was the highest in over three-and-a-half years, and only the sixth reading in positive territory since. Analysts linked the improved overall business conditions largely to “greater market movement and an increase in demand,” the PMI report said. A sub-index for output also returned to expansion, rising to 51.1 in April from 49.9 in March. The upswing came after last month’s significant rise of over three points, reaching its highest since August. “The improvement from the first quarter – the PMI index averaged just 48.9 over January to March – was broad-based, with most of the index’s subcomponents returning positive 50-plus readings,” said Daniel Richards, MENA economist at Emirates NBD. The output sub-index was positive for the first time since November 2017 “as firms noticed stronger demand, and a positive reading for new orders for the second month in a row bodes well for this continuing over subsequent readings,” Richards said. New exports orders remained in contractionary territory, though rose to 48.9 in April from 46.8 in March. It was the slowest contraction since December. “Some firms noted a lack of new foreign contracts and a shift in focus towards domestic sales,” the report said, while “others saw higher demand from new markets such as Italy, Turkey and Japan.” Future output sentiment improved from March, and saw its second-highest reading in 12 months. Companies said “new projects, increased tourism and expansion into new foreign markets are likely to boost business activity,” the report said. “With input prices increasing at a faster rate than seen in March, firms’ margins will be squeezed by ongoing price discounting,” Richards said. “Nevertheless, they appear to be more confident with regards (to) future conditions”. “This greater optimism is reflected in their hiring, as employment returned a reading above 50.0 – albeit marginally – for the first time since 2015.” (Reporting by Yousef Saba Editing by Ros Russell)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

69,Elliott wants Whitbread to offload chunks of its property portfolio: Sunday Telegraph - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  10:31 PM / 2 days ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Elliott Advisors has become increasingly frustrated with Whitbread Plc’s strategy of owning Premier Inn hotels outright and wants the company to offload chunks of its 5.8 billion pound ($7.64 billion) property portfolio, the Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the report on Saturday, the activist investor believes Whitbread’s strategy is “depressing” the company’s share price and is leaving it open to a cut-price hostile takeover. Citing city sources, the newspaper said Elliott wanted Whitbread to sell 10 to 15 percent of its hotel portfolio and “continue to be open minded about the rest”. The shareholder is also keen for Whitbread to bolster its board with directors having hotel industry experience, the Sunday Telegraph reported, adding that the company was searching for board members with experience of operating hotels in continental Europe. Last August, Whitbread agreed to sell its almost 4,000 Costa coffee shops to Coca-Cola Co for $5.1 billion after pressure from hedge funds, including activist investor Elliott, which said the coffee chain was held back by being grouped with the Premier Inn hotel chain.

70,"Warren Buffett defends Kraft, says Wells Fargo made 'big mistakes' - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  5:13 AM / 2 days ago","6 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled his commitment to Kraft Heinz Co and defended his actions toward Wells Fargo & Co, two of the largest investments at his Berkshire Hathaway Inc, despite mistakes at both that have caused many investors to sour on them. Buffett, 88, spoke before tens of thousands of people in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Berkshire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, fielded more than 50 shareholder and analyst questions for six hours at the centerpiece of a weekend of events. Kraft Heinz has been a thorn for Berkshire, which in February took a $3 billion writedown on its 26.7 percent stake, because of the packaged food company’s inability to keep up with changing consumer tastes and reliance on older brands such as Oscar Mayer and Jell-O. The company was created from the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, the latter of which had been owned by Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital, which runs Kraft Heinz day-to-day. Buffett defended 3G’s management, saying the combined company is doing well operationally, and that its current problems cannot be blamed on a lack of investment. But he also maintained that “we paid too much money” for Kraft. “You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much,” he said, while adding it was “not inconceivable” Berkshire could partner with 3G again on a transaction. He said 3G had more willingness to take on leverage and “pay up,” but in many cases also had “way better operators.” Buffett, who became famous in 1991 for criticizing Salomon Inc’s practices and becoming interim chairman to right the mess, also faced a question about his relative silence about Wells Fargo, where Berkshire owns a nearly 10-percent stake. Wells Fargo has spent more than 2-1/2 years addressing fallout from mistreating its customers, including by creating fake accounts, losing two chief executives in the process, including Tim Sloan in March. Buffett repeated that Wells Fargo “made some big mistakes” in its sales practices, and that “when you find a problem, you have to do something about it.” He also said chief executives who make big mistakes shouldn’t walk away with their wealth. But many questionable Wells Fargo practices long predated Sloan’s becoming chief executive, and Buffett and Munger have defended him. “I don’t think people ought to go to jail for honest errors of judgment,” Munger said, calling Sloan an “accidental casualty.” Berkshire also reported on Saturday that operating income, a measure of Berkshire’s business performance, rose 5 percent, helped by the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, though it fell just shy of analyst forecasts. Results excluded Kraft Heinz because that company has not released its own quarterly results, Buffett said. Berkshire also repurchased $1.7 billion of stock, reflecting Buffett’s difficulty in finding better uses for the company’s $114.2 billion cash hoard. Buffett acknowledged he would be willing to repurchase $100 billion of stock if it became cheap enough, and Munger predicted Berkshire would become “more liberal” with buybacks. “This much cash is certainly a drag” for Buffett, said Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners LLC in Memphis. “He and Charlie are certainly open that they missed it on several great businesses for many years. The purchases of Apple and Amazon are a good sign.” Berkshire owns more than $50 billion of Apple Inc stock, and Buffett said one of Berkshire’s portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, has invested in Amazon.com Inc. Munger also lamented Berkshire’s failure to invest in Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I feel like a horse’s ass for not identifying Google earlier.” Berkshire’s more than 90 businesses and roughly 389,000 employees make the company a barometer for the U.S. economy, and a report card for one of the world’s most revered investors. The shareholder weekend is not all business. Buffett on Saturday morning made his usual slow-motion crawl, with a crowd of photographers in tow, through an exhibit hall where shareholders could buy Berkshire-owned products, including 20,000 pounds of See’s candies and 28,752 Dairy Queen bars. “We love you Warren,” shareholders shouted as Buffett nibbled a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. People lined up before midnight to get early access to the best seats at the arena, which opened at 7 a.m. Daphne Kalir-Starr, 9, a fourth-grader from New York City, lined up with her father at 11 p.m. on Friday night, along with her sleeping bag. It’s her third time to see Buffett. “I really like hearing from great investors,” she said. “Even though he wasn’t really recognized at the beginning, he kept working at it.” Bela Chowdhury, 49, came from Kolkata, India, with other students from a nonprofit group that promotes financial literacy for women. “He is the ultimate guru,” she said. Meanwhile, Luke On, a University of Toronto finance undergraduate, said he lined up at 10 p.m. on Friday. “I have no place to stay and wanted to save money, but I wanted to see Warren and Charlie,” he said.

72,Warren Buffett: Berkshire discloses enough about itself - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  8:39 PM / 2 days ago","2 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb., May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday rejected a frequent criticism that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc does not disclose enough about its more than 90, often large operating businesses or its common stock investments. Buffett defended Berkshire’s disclosures in responding to three questions at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Meyer Shields, of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, is among the critics of Berkshire’s disclosures, saying in an April 28 report they leave investors “disproportionately reliant” on Buffett’s public persona and past investment successes rather than actual knowledge about the company. Berkshire owns or co-owns several companies, such as the BNSF railroad, large enough to be in the Fortune 500 on their own, yet which merit no more than a couple of pages in its quarterly and annual reports. Profit and revenue for many smaller units are not disclosed at all. Buffett said “I don’t think we actually provide less information” in periodic reports, but may present it in a different form. He insisted that overwhelming investors with technical information was the wrong idea, saying you can “lose people” in a 300-page report that says less than a 50-page report. Buffett also said Berkshire did not need to know the reasoning beyond its investments in stocks generally and foreign stocks, saying it might require the disclosure of proprietary strategies or would not be legally required.

74,"Defying Congress, U.S. Attorney General Barr to skip Mueller hearing - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  2:08 AM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defying the U.S. Congress, Attorney General William Barr will not attend a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday on his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation report, said panel Chairman Jerrold Nadler, accusing Barr of being afraid to testify. “Barr has just informed us that he will not attend tomorrow’s hearing,” Nadler, a Democrat, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday after a contentious Senate hearing earlier in the day where Barr defended his treatment of the report. The Justice Department also said on Wednesday it would not comply with a subpoena seeking Mueller’s full report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election and underlying investigative files from the probe.  Committee Democrats vowed to issue a subpoena to force Barr to testify, while Nadler held out hope that the attorney general would reconsider and show up when the hearing convenes at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday.  “We plan on subpoenaing him if he decides not to show up. He can run but he can’t hide,” Democratic Representative Hakeem Jeffries told reporters. A Justice Department spokeswoman said in a statement that the panel had placed “unprecedented and unnecessary” conditions on Barr’s testimony and called the questions posed by committee staff inappropriate. “The attorney general remains happy to engage directly with members,” the statement said.  Barr’s decision not to testify surfaced hours after the committee adopted a more aggressive format that would subject the attorney general to an extra hour of questions from committee lawyers, in addition to questions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the panel. Nadler insisted that it was not the administration’s place to determine the format for the hearing.  “He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney,” the chairman said of Barr. “Given how dishonest he has been ... I can understand why he’s afraid of facing more effective examination.” The House Judiciary chairman also said he would consider a contempt citation against the attorney general if the unredacted version of the report was not made available.  In a letter to Nadler on Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the requests made in the subpoena were “overbroad and extraordinarily burdensome.” The Justice Department has made available a version of the report that has fewer redactions than the one issued publicly, withholding only grand jury information that must be kept secret by law, he added. The department would be willing to seek an accommodation over more targeted requests for Mueller-related documents, Boyd said. Nadler issued the subpoena on April 19, a day after Barr released a redacted version of the report, which also looked at whether President Donald Trump attempted to obstruct investigations after the 2016 election. The Mueller report details a series of acts by Trump to impede the Russia probe but does not conclude whether those actions constitute the crime of obstruction. It found, however, that Trump and his campaign did not engage in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow. Democrats contend that Barr misrepresented the contents of the Mueller report in a March 24 summary and during a subsequent news conference. They also allege that he may have provided misleading testimony to Congress about criticism he received from Mueller.  Some Democrats including Senator Mazie Hirono said on Wednesday that Barr should resign. Asked if he agreed, Nadler told reporters: “He’s going to have to answer for apparently testifying untruthfully in both the Senate and the House, and that’s certainly one option.” Reporting by David Morgan; Additional reporting by Sarah N.

76,Trump seeks huge boost in emergency funds for migrant surge - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  4:20 PM / 5 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Wednesday asked Congress for $4.5 billion in immediate emergency funding, saying a surge in Central American children and families claiming asylum at the U.S. southern border had drained government resources. The money would come on top of the funding President Donald Trump has redirected to make good on a central pledge of his 2016 election campaign - to build a border wall to stop illegal immigrants - ahead of his looming 2020 presidential race. Trump’s top aides also are quietly courting members of Congress to get behind legislation being drafted to toughen the treatment of young undocumented immigrants detained at the U.S. border with Mexico, while also placing new limits on immigrants who could apply for asylum in the United States. The emergency funding request would represent a 44% increase in spending for programs that house, feed, transport and oversee record numbers of Central American families seeking asylum and straining capacity at migrant shelters in border cities such as El Paso, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico. “The situation has become more dire,” a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Agencies are literally running out of funds.” Trump earlier this year declared the immigration influx a national emergency, which allowed him to circumvent Congress to redirect more than $6 billion in funding to start building his border wall. His move has been challenged in courts. Asked why the administration did not redirect wall funding to the pressing humanitarian issues at the border, a second official told reporters that would not be allowed under budget rules. Trump threatened to shut down the border last month to stop the surge of migrants, and later raised the specter of a tariff on car imports from Mexico, but later backed off the threats. He fired several top Department of Homeland Security officials, including Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Now, Trump is considering a new proposal from his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner that includes border security provisions as well as measures to increase visas for skilled workers and seasonal labor for farms. To gain traction on immigration legislation, the White House would need the support of more than a handful of Senate Democrats for it to clear procedural hurdles in the Republican-controlled chamber. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is likely push back strongly against the still-to-be unveiled initiatives. Kevin McAleenan, Trump’s acting secretary of Homeland Security, met on Tuesday with a small group of Democratic senators in hopes of winning the support of at least some of the politically moderate ones. It was a follow-up to a meeting that Trump’s acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney held a few weeks ago with the senators, who has expressed concerns about the number of migrants arriving at the border. “They talked about what they want to do,” said Senator Jon Tester, who attended Tuesday’s meeting in fellow Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein’s office. Tester said he was awaiting a detailed proposal from the White House - which could come as early as this week - before taking a position. But Tester expressed reservations. Referring to White House attempts to end a long-standing court settlement known as Flores, which limits the duration immigrants under 18 can be detained by the government, Tester said: “I think it’s going to be very tough to change Flores.” “I think that there may some opportunity to send some kids back (to their native countries) if in fact we can determine they’re going to safe conditions ... but that’s got to be rock-solid,” Tester added. Many of the children seeking U.S. asylum come from Central American countries plagued by high murder rates, gang activity and illicit drug trade. Meanwhile, the House is expected to advance much different immigration legislation in coming weeks: a bill that would protect from deportation “dreamers,” or immigrants brought illegally into the United States by their parents at a young age. The measure would put them on a path to U.S. citizenship if they met certain requirements and could garner significant support from Republicans.

78,"HIGHLIGHTS-Wit and wisdom of Warren Buffett, the 'Oracle of Omaha' - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  3:29 PM / 2 days ago","5 Min Read(Adds comments on Apple, 3G Capital and Google) NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the 88-year-old chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, is taking hours of questions from investors, analysts and journalists at the conglomerate’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. Buffett’s marathon Q&A session is part of what the billionaire investor calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” the annual shareholder weekend for his company. Below are some of Buffett’s comments, and those of Berkshire’s Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, on a wide range of topics. “I like our Apple holdings very much,” Buffett said on Apple being Berkshire’s largest holding, declining to discuss expectations about the company. Munger added: “In my family, the people who have Apple phones, it’s the last thing they’ll give up.” “They have more of a taste of leverage than we do… but they also ... in certain types of situations ... would be way better operators,” Buffett said. Buffett called Jorge Paulo Lemann, co-founder of Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, “a good friend of mine and marvelous human being.” Munger said not buying shares of Google was a big mistake. “We just sat there sucking our thumbs,” Munger said. “We’re ashamed.” “Amazon itself has become a brand. Kirkland is now a brand doing $39 billion. Kirkland does more business than Coke does. Certain retail systems have gained some power, and particularly in the case of Amazon and Walmart and Costco, have gained in power relative to brands.” “Kraft-Heinz is still doing very well operationally, but we paid too much.” Buffett added: “You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much. What you can’t do is turn something into a good deal by paying little.” “I’m a card-carrying capitalist. I believe we wouldn’t be sitting here except for the market system and the rule of law ... that are embodied in this country. So you don’t have to worry about me changing in that manner.” “The people making the decision on (buying) Amazon are absolutely value investors. That has not changed. They are following value principles. They are smart. They are totally committed to Berkshire. I don’t second-guess them.” “The considerations are identical when you buy Amazon versus some bank stock that looks cheap statistically.” “The new GAAP rules .... require that we mark our securities to market and report any unrealized gains. The bottom line figures are going to be totally capricious. “I really regard these bottom line figures ... as potentially being harmful to our shareholders and really not being helpful. Focus on what we call our operating earnings, which were up a bit.” “The question whether we had a $100 billion or $200 would not make a difference in our approach to repurchase shares. We used to have a policy of tying to book value, but that became ... obsolete.” “We could do it (buy back $100 billion of Berkshire stock). We will spend a lot of money. We’ve been involved in companies where the number of shares has been reduced 70-80 percent over time. “If our stock gets cheap relative to intrinsic value, we will not hesitate. We would certainly be willing to spend $100 billion.” Berkshire will “probably be more liberal when it comes to repurchasing shares.” “Wells made some big mistakes in what they incentivized. The interesting thing is the extent to which they set up fake accounts, couple million of them that had no balance in them, that could not possibly have been profitable to Wells.” “When you find a problem, you have to do something about it. I think that’s probably where they made a mistake.” “Wells has become Exhibit One. Go back a few years, there’s quite a list of banks where people have behaved badly.” ON HIS 60-YEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH MUNGER “We make the big decisions jointly. It’s just that we haven’t had any big decisions.” Compiled by Nick Zieminski and Jennifer Ablan in New York;

80,Erdogan signals he backs re-run of contested Istanbul vote - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  12:53 PM / 2 days ago","4 Min ReadANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan signaled on Saturday he backs a re-run of mayoral elections in Istanbul which resulted in a narrow victory for the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) for the first time in 25 years. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party (AKP), which also lost control of the capital Ankara in the March 31 local elections, has already filed an appeal to Turkey’s High Election Board (YSK) to annul and re-run the election in Istanbul due to what it says were irregularities. The YSK is expected to rule on the AKP challenge on Monday, but it has ordered district electoral officials in Istanbul to investigate their respective ballot box officials in its interim rulings.  Prosecutors on Thursday launched probes into allegations of irregularities in Istanbul and summoned more than 100 polling station officials for questioning as suspects, in a move the opposition CHP said would not alter the results of the vote. Speaking to Turkish businesspeople in Istanbul, Erdogan said the Istanbul elections were marred by irregularities and called on the YSK to make a decision that would eliminate controversies and “clear its name”. “My people tell me the elections should be renewed. I have not spoken until now, I’ve been silent. But everyone else has spoken. Enough already,” Erdogan said. “There is a controversy here, it’s clear. There is an irregularity here, that’s clear too. Let’s go to the people and see what they say and whatever the outcome, we will accept it.”  Erdogan had accused the opposition of supporting “terrorism” and labeled the local election a “matter of survival” for Turkey during his campaign, which was held amid growing disenchantment among voters over economic woes. CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak told reporters later on Saturday that it was time for Erdogan and his AKP to accept defeat. “The real matter of survival here is those who put aside the people’s concerns about food prices, wages and focus instead on their own benefits,” Oztrak told a news conference in Ankara. “There is only one thing that can clear the YSK. That is for it to act in line with its regulations and previous rulings.” The uncertainty over the results in Istanbul, which accounts for around a third of the country’s economy, has kept financial markets on edge, as Turkey tries to recover from a currency crisis that saw the lira lose more than 30 percent of its value last year. On Friday, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said the Istanbul elections had become a test of democracy. He accused the AKP of exerting political pressure on the YSK to order a re-run of the vote. Erdogan said his party was only exercising its legal rights. “Claiming that Tayyip Erdogan is trying to steal an election he has no right to is the biggest insult,” Erdogan said. “We are not hurling threats, we’re just waiting.” While the CHP’s Ekrem Imamoglu took office as Istanbul’s new mayor last month, the AKP won 25 of the city’s 39 districts and the majority of seats in the municipal council. It has said that this proved irregularities had taken place. Speaking to his supporters on Saturday, Imamoglu said the AKP appeals were unreasonable. “So the 25 districts are all clean, the municipal council votes are perfect, but when it comes to the mayorship, there is an irregularity. We can only laugh at this,” Imamoglu said. Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Gareth Jones and Ros RussellAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that Prince’s “false statements” impaired the panel’s efforts to “fully understand” Russia’s meddling and develop remedies to “counter future malign operations.” Russia denies interfering in the election in which President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, defeated his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “We refer this matter to the (Justice) department to consider whether criminal charges should be brought,” Schiff wrote. “I believe there was very strong evidence that he (Prince) willingly misled the committee, made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told a Washington Post event earlier on Tuesday, citing a January 2017 meeting between Prince and a Russian banker in the Seychelles. “The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this.” The Department of Justice declined to comment. At issue are discrepancies between Prince’s testimony to Schiff’s committee in November 2017 and what Mueller’s report detailed about Prince’s contact with Kirill Dmitriev, who reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin as head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund.[nL1N2201TM] In the letter to Barr, Schiff said the committee identified “six different categories of materially false statements” by Prince. Those statements, he wrote, included Prince telling the panel that he and Dmitriev had one chance encounter when both were staying at the same Seychelles hotel, whereas the Mueller report said an adviser to the ruler of the United Arab Emirates arranged for them to meet and that they saw each other twice. Schiff charged that Prince also misled the panel about the topics of the pair’s discussions, including setting up a U.S.-Russia communications channel, and that Prince told lawmakers he did not brief former Trump aide Steve Bannon about the meetings with Dmitriev, whereas the Mueller report said he did. Matthew L. Schwartz, a lawyer for Prince, rejected Schiff’s allegations. There “is nothing new here for the Justice Department to consider, nor is there any reason to question the special counsel’s decision to credit Mr. Prince and rely on him in drafting its report,” he said in a statement. Prince “cooperated completely” with Mueller’s investigation, said Schwartz, a partner at the firm of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Separately, Prince has been pushing a plan to deploy a private army to help topple Venezuela’s socialist president, Nicholas Maduro, four sources with knowledge of the effort told Reuters. [nL1N228178] U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, head of House Republicans’ Freedom Caucus, separately told the Post event that Republicans were considering sending their own criminal referrals for two to three individuals. He declined to name them or give many details, but said two of them were linked to Fusion GPS. Fusion GPS is a research and intelligence consultancy that hired former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele to investigate Trump and Russia. “There are two or three individuals that we believe could have potentially given false testimony to Congress,” said Meadows, a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel. That committee and the Intelligence Committee are among several congressional panels examining Russian interference in American politics, including in the 2016 presidential election.  Meadows added that Trump had not personally encouraged House Republicans to make any referrals to the Justice Department over congressional misstatements, and that he had not spoken to the president about the issue “from a criminal referrals standpoint.” Reporting by Susan Heavey; Writing by Jonathan Oatis; Editing by Howard Goller and Tom BrownAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

84,Trump sets Twitter ablaze after firefighters union backs Biden - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  1:29 PM / 5 days ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump fired off dozens of retweets from purported firefighters, their families and acquaintances on Wednesday, in his latest assault on Joe Biden, the newest Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination. Trump’s response comes two days after the country’s largest union of firefighters endorsed Biden, the former vice president who shot to the top of opinion polls after entering the race last week. Trump began his tirade at dawn by quoting Fox News  personality Dan Bongino, who said he knew no firefighters who would vote for Biden.  “I’ve done more for Firefighters than this dues sucking union will ever do, and I get paid ZERO!” Trump wrote on Twitter, without elaborating.   He followed that post by retweeting nearly 60 accounts who responded to Bongino by either criticizing Biden or professing support for Trump. Biden did not respond to Wednesday’s tweetstorm but a campaign spokeswoman for Biden noted Trump’s disquiet with sarcasm. “No, he doesn’t seem concerned at all,” Kate Bedingfield wrote on Twitter. Though Trump, a Republican, has boasted he could handily beat any Democratic opponent, some of Biden’s supporters believe the former vice president may be able to capture votes from the same Midwestern states that steered Trump to victory in 2016. Biden announced his candidacy on Thursday with a direct attack on Trump, whom he called a “threat to this nation.”  In his third bid for president, Biden has surged in the public opinion polls, with a CNN poll giving him a 15 percentage point lead in a field of 20 Democratic candidates. Breaking with tradition, Trump has weighed in on a number of his would-be opponents, but reserved most of his barbs for Biden and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, another leading candidate.

86,U.S. court rules in favor of Dutch ASML in IP theft case against Xtal - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  10:54 AM / in 2 days","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Dutch chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV said on Saturday a U.S. court had issued its final judgment in favor of ASML in an intellectual property theft case against U.S. software maker Xtal. The Santa Clara County Superior Court in California awarded ASML $845 million along with an injunction, ASML said.  The Netherlands-based company said the judgment would be uncollectible as Xtal is in bankruptcy, but under a settlement arrangement ASML will end up owning most or all of Xtal’s intellectual property through the bankruptcy process. As part of the injunction, the court ordered Xtal not to conduct development activities on its software products that ASML says contain the Dutch company’s intellectual property. ASML said the injunction also bars Xtal from continuing to work in the same field of business as Brion, ASML’s computational lithography product, for a period of time. In April, ASML disclosed that former employees took company secrets to Xtal, which is funded by entities in South Korea and China and set up to sell a competing product to an existing ASML customer in South Korea.

Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives lost 1,332 seats on English local councils that were up for re-election, while the main opposition Labour Party, which would typically aim to gain hundreds of seats in a mid-term vote, instead lost 81. “If we thought yesterday’s results were a wake-up call, just wait for the European elections on the 23rd of May,” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told a party conference in Aberdeen. “So I say to the negotiating teams of our party and the Labour Party, who are currently locked in talks – get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on.” (Reporting by Elisabeth O’Leary, writing by David Milliken Editing by Gareth Jones)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

90,Puerto Rico announces deal to restructure power authority debt - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  1:44 AM / in 2 days","4 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power utility struck a deal with a group of creditors that seeks to allow the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to restructure more than $8 billion of bonds, according to an announcement by government authorities on Friday. A group of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bondholders, bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, along with the island’s government and federally created financial oversight board, reached a restructuring support agreement that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32.5 percent. The move paves the way for a plan of adjustment for PREPA, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in July 2017 after a previous restructuring deal fell apart. The latest agreement, which requires support from at least 67 percent of voting bondholders to materialize, would shed about $3 billion in debt service payments over the next decade.  The deal also requires the approval of a U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, as well as legislative action. Under the agreement, investors will exchange their PREPA bonds at 67.5 cents on the dollar for new Tranche A bonds and 10 cents on the dollar for new Tranche B bonds. The latter would be contingent on full payment of Tranche A bonds and future electricity demand on the island. PREPA will pay off the new bonds through a special charge levied on its customers. The new charge starts at approximately 1 cent per kilowatt hour prior to the deal’s closing, increasing to some 2.768 cents per kilowatt hour upon closing and gradually increasing to approximately 4.552 cents per kilowatt hour during the expected 40-year lifespan of the bonds. The deal still lacks the support of other PREPA creditors, most notably bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. A spokesman for National declined to comment. National Public Finance filed an objection last month when a deal in principle was announced, saying that “until very recently” it was excluded from negotiations even though it is PREPA’s largest creditor. National has also asked the court to appoint a receiver for PREPA, support among other creditor remains unclear following Friday’s announcement. According to government and board officials, the privatization of PREPA is under way, with transmission and distribution contracts with private companies expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2020. “Now with this agreement we take a monumental step to provide for the restructuring of the debts and obligations of PREPA and finally conclude the bankruptcy process,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement. If approved in federal court, PREPA’s restructuring would mark the third major deal in Puerto Rico’s efforts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Deals involving the island’s sales tax-backed bonds and Government Development Bank have been approved by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain. PREPA’s financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September 2017, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.

91,Ride-hailing drivers in New York to strike ahead of Uber IPO - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:02 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in New York will go on strike next week shortly before the ride-hailing company goes public to protest what they view as unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said on Friday. The protests underscore the challenge for Uber of finding a way to lower driver costs in order to become profitable and paying drivers enough to retain their services.  Drivers for Uber, as well Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing apps, will strike on Wednesday for two hours, beginning at 7 a.m. ET (1100 GMT). Uber currently expects to price its IPO on Thursday and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day.  The drivers join peers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., who are also planning to strike. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said the drivers are demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares.  “Uber claims that we are independent contractors even though they set our rates and control our work day,” Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015, said in a statement.  “Uber executives are getting rich off of our work. They should treat us with respect. We are striking to send a message that drivers will keep rising up,” Lama said. Uber cautioned in its IPO filing that its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors. The company hopes to be valued at between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. Uber has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2019.  “I voted to go on strike because drivers need job security,” said Henry Rolands, an NYTWA member and Lyft driver.  Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lyft said in an emailed statement that its drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the last two year. “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs. On average, drivers nationwide earn over $20 per hour,” Lyft said. Reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

95,Turkey's AK Party: U.S. move against Muslim Brotherhood would damage democracy in Middle East - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  8:25 PM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadISTANBUL (Reuters) - The spokesman for Turkey’s ruling AK Party said on Tuesday that if the United States designated the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization, it would hamper democratization efforts in the Middle East and serve militant groups like Islamic State. The White House said on Tuesday President Donald Trump was working to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a foreign terrorist organization, a step that would bring sanctions against Egypt’s oldest Islamist movement. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi asked Trump to make the designation, which Egypt has already done, in a private meeting during an April 9 visit to Washington, a senior U.S. official said, confirming a report in the New York Times. Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted AK Party, said such a decision by the United States would “undoubtedly yield extremely wrong results regarding stability, human rights, basic rights and freedoms in countries of the Islamic world”, he said. “At the same time, (Trump’s move) is the biggest support that can be given to the propaganda of Daesh,” he said, referring to Islamic State. Despite being NATO allies, Turkey and the United States are currently at loggerheads mainly over their opposing interests in Syria and Ankara’s plans to buy Russian missile defenses. Relations between Ankara and Cairo have been strained since the Egyptian military, then led by Sisi, ousted President Mohamed Mursi, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. The Muslim Brotherhood has close ties with Turkey’s AK Party and many of its members have fled there since its activities were banned in Egypt. It says it is an entirely peaceful organization. Egypt’s Brotherhood said on Tuesday it would continue to work in line with “our moderate and peaceful thinking” regardless of moves by the Trump administration. Egyptian authorities under Sisi have jailed thousands of its followers and much of its leadership, including Mursi. The Brotherhood says it is a non-violent movement and denies any relationship to violent insurgencies waged by al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

96,"As Fed meets, Trump calls for sharp rate cut, stimulus - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  6:20 PM / 6 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, in perhaps his most unorthodox statement yet on monetary policy, called for the U.S. Federal Reserve to act as if the country was back in the throes of recession, with sharp interest rate cuts and renewed “quantitative easing” to pump trillions of dollars into the economy. As Fed officials met in Washington for their latest policy discussion, Trump on Tuesday tweeted that it would send the U.S. economy “up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing.” It would also likely prove destabilizing to global and U.S. financial markets that would have to adjust to a seemingly capricious decision to cut U.S. interest rates nearly in half for no obvious reason and absorb an uncertain amount of new U.S. dollars. Much smaller, unexpected shifts in policy have led to large swings in the value of the dollar, and put developing countries and their financial institutions under stress. The Fed’s target interest rate currently is set at a range of between 2.25 and 2.5 percent. Reductions of a full percentage point last occurred during the onset of the 2007 to 2009 recession.   The Fed is unlikely to follow Trump’s advice. Policymakers are expected on Wednesday to hold rates steady and to pledge to be “patient” in deciding on any future rate changes. The Fed is also likely to allow the central bank’s asset holdings to continue to shrink - not expand as they would under quantitative easing. Many Republicans, and Trump himself, were critical of quantitative easing when it was introduced during the recession, suggesting it was likely to cause inflation.  But the remarks do show the ongoing tension between the White House and the Fed, even though four of the current five members of the central bank’s board of governors were chosen for their jobs by Trump. In recent weeks his efforts to name more overtly partisan supporters to the Fed have run into opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill, prompting potential nominee Herman Cain to withdraw from consideration and leaving potential nominee Stephen Moore’s fate in doubt.  Trump’s anger at the Fed comes despite recent data showing the economy continuing to grow, and despite the fact that equity markets have regained much of their value since a sharp drop last fall. Trump blamed that sell-off on the Fed’s December rate increase, its fourth of the year, and in effect has asked the Fed to take back all of its rate changes since 2017. Current growth of 3.2 percent is “doing very well...but with our wonderfully low inflation, we could be setting major records,” Trump said in a tweet.  Trump’s criticism of the Fed was prefaced by some admiring comments about China, where, unlike the United States, the central bank is not insulated from the government’s immediate demands.  “China is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low,” Trump said, referring to steps China took in recent months to fight a sharp economic slowdown.

97,"Senators blast 'insane' Trump plan for aid cuts, seek Venezuela plan - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  7:59 PM / 6 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators blasted President Donald Trump’s proposal for a 23 percent cut in the U.S. budget for foreign aid and diplomacy as “insane” and “short-sighted” on Tuesday, and said it would not pass. “We’re not going to approve this budget reduction. It’s insane. It makes no sense,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department and foreign aid budget. “I don’t know who writes these things over in the White House, but they clearly don’t understand the value of soft power,” the Republican senator, a close Trump ally on many issues, told a subcommittee hearing on the foreign aid budget. Graham also called the plan “short-sighted” and said the Appropriations panel would restore funding to previous levels, rather than enacting the 23 percent cut Trump proposed earlier this year. Graham also asked Mark Green, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, to send Congress a plan for how it would assist Venezuela in case of a change in government in the troubled South American state. [nL1N22C1PL] The hearing took place on Tuesday against a backdrop of upheaval in Venezuela, where Washington’s desire to ship in  millions of dollars in foreign aid has been a central theme of the Trump administration’s push for a change in government. [nL1N22C07O] The Senate subcommittee’s top Democrat, Senator Patrick Leahy, also opposed the cuts, citing the importance of “soft power” like foreign aid to U.S. influence around the world. “Our soft power should not be a partisan issue, it should be an American issue and we’re going to try to keep it that way,” Leahy said at the hearing, at which Green testified on Trump’s proposed budget. Graham asked if Trump’s administration had a plan in place to help the Venezuela people if President Nicolas Maduro’s government were to fall. Graham suggested that the administration submit an emergency funding request for Venezuela to his committee, including a plan. “I think most members of this committee would gladly help you with some resources to stabilize Venezuela when Maduro falls, not if. In that regard, we would very much appreciate any advice you give us about what a good response would look like,” Graham said.

98,US STOCKS-Wall St rises as jobs report supports upbeat economic outlook - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:18 PM / in 3 days","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. April job additions rise solidly above estimates * Amazon.com up as Berkshire Hathaway buys shares * Indexes up: Dow 0.8%, S&P 0.9%, Nasdaq 1.4% (Updates to late afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad-based rally on Friday as stronger-than-expected job growth in April with muted wage gains left investors upbeat about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. The data supports the Federal Reserve’s patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “As long as inflation is below trend, that’s good. So if you have the Fed in a box, you have strong labor force gains, that could portend for better earnings in the future for companies,” he said. Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.6 points, or 0.77%, to 26,510.39, the S&P 500 gained 26.62 points, or 0.91%, to 2,944.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 112.10 points, or 1.39%, to 8,148.87. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies reporting so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around the earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise compared with a 2% decline projected at the start of April. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc fell after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 28 new lows.

99,"Oil edges up after strong economic data, but ends week lower - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  1:46 AM / in 3 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Friday as strong U.S. economic data boosted demand sentiment and as production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela tightened the market. Still, oil futures recorded weekly declines after a jump in U.S. crude inventories reported this week. Brent crude oil futures settled at $70.85 a barrel, rising 10 cents. The global benchmark shed 2.6% for the week, breaking a five-week winning streak.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures closed at $61.94 a barrel, up 13 cents, while losing about 3% percent during the week, its second straight weekly decline. A U.S. jobs report that showed growth surging in April and the unemployment rate dropping to a more than 49-year low of 3.6% increased expectations that crude demand would stay strong. “If more people are going to work, they’re going to have to drive or take transportation to get there,” Phil Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “It’s a good indication we could expect to see gasoline demand, oil demand picking up into the summer.” Equities rallied and the U.S. dollar weakened following the report, which also supported oil futures, Streible said. Oil prices tend to follow moves in equities, and demand for the U.S. dollar-linked commodity often increases when the greenback slips.  Gains in the oil market, however, were capped by Wednesday’s report that showed U.S. crude inventories jumping to their highest since September 2017 and production hitting a record 12.3 million barrels per day last week.. Exports of U.S. crude broke through 3 million bpd in November for the first time and peaked at 3.6 million bpd earlier this year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.     This week’s U.S. rig count, an indicator of future output, showed energy firms adding crude drilling rigs for the first time in three weeks, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production link: tmsnrt.rs/2VFPX81). U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, helped to tighten the market and support prices. Russia, part of OPEC+, is cutting oil output by as much as 10 percent for several days as its exports suffered from disruptions due to contamination of crude in a major pipeline to Europe and at a key port for shipments, industry sources said. Production from Saudi Arabia could edge higher in June to meet domestic demand for power generation, though output will remain within its quota in the supply pact, sources familiar with the kingdom’s policy said. The world’s top crude exporter is expected to produce about 10 million bpd in May, slightly higher than in April but still below its 10.3 million bpd quota under the OPEC-led deal, industry sources said.

100,PG&E unable to strike deal over renewable power contracts -court documents - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:03 PM / 3 days ago","2 Min Read(Story follows a brief) May 3 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp was unable to reach a deal with NextEra Energy Inc and other companies with which it has billions of dollars in in power contracts in a jurisdictional dispute over the bankrupt utility’s ability to walk away from or amend those agreements, according to court documents. The matter will now be decided by the judge overseeing PG&E’s bankruptcy “in the coming weeks,” according to the documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday. Officials from PG&E and NextEra were not immediately available for comment. At issue is whether the bankruptcy court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over the power purchase contracts, which are worth up to $42 billion. San Francisco-headquartered PG&E wants the matter resolved in bankruptcy court, while NextEra and others want FERC involved. FERC has said it has “concurrent jurisdiction” with the bankruptcy court in such matters. The contracts have emerged as one of the most contentious issues in PG&E’s bankruptcy, which the company launched in January in the face of tens of billions of dollars in potential liability stemming from wildfires in California in recent years that may be traced to its equipment. The question of what will happen to the power contracts is critical for California’s goal to source 60 percent of its power from sources of renewable energy by 2030. Most of the power contracts in question are for solar or wind resources to fulfill the state mandate. Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali urged the companies and PG&E to try to reach an agreement by a May 3 deadline. In the court papers made public on Friday, they said they were unable to reach an agreement.

101,RPT-Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:03 PM / 3 days ago","2 Min Read(Repeats to attach to corrected alert, no change to content of story) By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview. “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the US economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said, adding that he would not view such a rate cut as taking out insurance against a possible bad outcome, as some analysts have suggested the Fed might do. Instead, he said, it would be a move that would build credibility and help the Fed fight future downturns. “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, despite an unemployment rate that has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent.

102,PRECIOUS-Gold eyes biggest daily gain in two months as dollar retreats - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:12 PM / in 3 days","3 Min Read* Gold down 0.5 pct so far this week * Platinum set for worst week in eight * SPDR gold holdings fall to lowest in nearly 7 months (Updates prices, adds fresh comments) By Brijesh Patel May 3 (Reuters) - Gold was headed for its biggest daily rise in two months on Friday, clawing away from a four-month low hit in the previous session, helped by a pullback in the dollar and as some investors covered their short positions. Spot gold rose 0.7% to $1,279.47 per ounce as of 2:22 p.m. EDT (1822 GMT), and was set for its biggest percentage gain since March 8. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% higher at $1,281.30 an ounce. The metal on Thursday dipped to $1,265.85, its lowest since the end of December. “We are seeing a short-covering rally after a sell-off during the week. We also saw some good physical demand at price levels below $1,270,” said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. “The dollar is weak, which is also helping gold,” he added. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report, the dollar was down 0.3%, as traders focused on the weaker aspects in the report. The U.S. wage gains did not accelerate as expected last month, holding at a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. A moderate pace of wage growth indicated that there would not be a rate hike anytime soon, in turn boosting appeal for the non-interest bearing metal, said an analyst based in New York. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the bullion. Despite the gains, gold is still on track to post a weekly decline of about 0.5% after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled little appetite to adjust interest rates in the near term. However, two Fed officials said on Friday they were increasingly worried about weak inflation, an indication that some U.S. central bankers see a growing case for a future interest rate cut even as others push for continued patience. Market participants were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a resolution to the year long tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the U.S.-China trade negotiations are going pretty well. Reflecting investor sentiment toward bullion, holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust, fell about 0.2% to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. Among other metals, silver rose 2.2% to $14.94 per ounce, after falling to a more than four-month low of $14.52 in the previous session. Platinum gained 2.6% to $869.75 per ounce, but has lost 3.3% for the week so far, its biggest weekly decline in eight. Palladium climbed 0.8% to $1,365.01 an ounce. (Reporting by Brijesh Patel and K.

103,MONEY MARKETS-U.S. fed funds rate slips after Fed's tweak on reserves - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:43 PM / in 3 days","3 Min Read* Fed funds rate falls to lowest since mid-April * Fed funds/IOER, however, hit a record 6 bps on Thursday * Repo facility seen best to control fed funds rate - BAML (Adds background, quotes, graphic) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The rate U.S. banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight fell on Thursday a day after the Federal Reserve adjusted what it pays banks on reserves they leave with the U.S. central bank, New York Federal Reserve data released on Friday showed. The average or effective federal funds rate fell to 2.41%, the lowest since April 16, from 2.45% on Wednesday. The fed funds rate’s premium above the Fed’s interest on excess reserves (IOER), however, grew to a record-high 6 basis points from 5 basis points the day before. A number of factors have led to the stubborn upward drift in the fed funds rate, including reduced bank reserves linked to the Fed’s balance sheet normalization, increased government borrowing, and less willingness by big banks to lend reserves due to tougher capital standards in response to the global credit crisis. On Wednesday, the Fed shrank the gap between the IOER and the bottom end of its target rate on interest rates for a third time since last June in a bid to prevent the fed funds rate reaching the top of the range. It trimmed IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35%, while holding its target range at 2.25-2.50%. “The Fed got its intended results,” said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California. “The IOER cuts are technical in nature.” Still the Fed’s control of the fed funds rate is critical to bolster investors’ confidence in its effectiveness to conduct monetary policy. Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists Mark Cabana and Olivia Lima said on Friday the latest IOER move “is only a Band-Aid” to keep a lid on upward pressure on the fed funds rate. They suggested the central bank should introduce a standing repo program that would allow banks to exchange their Treasury holdings for short-term cash as the best means to control the fed funds rate.

104,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb after U.S. payrolls data tops views; dollar falls with inflation comments - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:28 PM / in 3 days","4 Min Read* U.S. jobless rate falls to 49-year low * Global shares on track for sixth straight weekly gain * Dollar weakens after comments from Fed officials (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that blew past expectations, while the dollar weakened after several Federal Reserve officials voiced concerns about low inflation. U.S. job growth surged in April, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus recedes. Wall Street stocks rallied, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, putting both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on track for weekly gains. The strong jobs report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, when the Fed reiterated that it would remain patient on any changes in interest rates and indicated that no rate cuts were on tap for later this year, disappointing the expectations of some investors. “There was probably something in the report for everybody but to the extent the Fed wants to stay patient, they will focus most on that wage number,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “There is just not a lot of inflationary pressures that are out there.” U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 209.15 points, or 0.8%, to 26,516.94, the S&P 500 gained 27.94 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.46, and the Nasdaq Composite added 117.69 points, or 1.46%, to 8,154.46. European shares closed higher, helped by gains in Adidas and HSBC after strong quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.75%. The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects of the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, and following softer-than-expected data from an industry group on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low. New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that “raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates ‘lower for longer’ after periods of low inflation” can keep people’s expectations for prices at the right levels. The dollar index fell 0.31%, with the euro up 0.13% to $1.1191. Oil prices advanced but were still on pace for a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude rose 0.31% to $62.00 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.02, up 0.38% on the day. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.5305%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2-week high. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Dan Grebler and

However, average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. “The labor market appears to be very strong and there is no inflation. It’s a great number for risk assets,” said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “In terms of Fed policymakers, they don’t have to do much at all.” Falling unemployment is expected to put an upward pressure on inflation and supported the Federal Reserve’s decision to be patient with interest rate hikes.

109,"Escalating fight, Trump sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One over Democratic subpoenas - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  2:11 PM / 6 days ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization have sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp to try to block them from responding to U.S. congressional subpoenas issued by Democrats seeking financial records. The lawsuit filed late Monday opens a new front in Trump’s battle to stop the Democratic-led House of Representatives from probing the Republican president, his family, his businesses and his administration after Special Counsel Robert Mueller finished his inquiry into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The lawsuit said urgent action was necessary because both banks signaled they would begin responding to the subpoenas unless a court intervened by May 6. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, asked Capital One’s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump’s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests.   In the complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and the Trump Organization accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose, hoping they would “stumble upon something” they could use as a political weapon against Trump. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the complaint said. Only the banks were named as defendants. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. “The president will do anything and everything that he can to obstruct justice ... to shut down an investigation,” Waters told reporters on Capitol Hill. She also said Trump has “cast a gauntlet and he has said that he is going to fight,” referring to her investigation of Deutsche Bank. “We will fight him,” Waters added. Deutsche Bank said it was “committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Capital One was not immediately available for comment.    Lawyers for the plaintiffs were also not immediately available. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama. Michael Stern, who served as senior House counsel from 1996 to 2004, said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because judges do not like second-guessing lawmakers’ motivations in investigations. Stern also said Trump’s decision to sue only Deutsche Bank and Capital One appears to have been strategic because the banks would not try to pick sides and were less likely to contest an injunction blocking a subpoena. Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer under Obama now at the law firm K&L Gates, said: “Courts have been really reluctant to assess whether or not Congress has a legitimate interest or not. They have been very deferential in the past.”  Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and said “we’re fighting all the subpoenas” issued by the House. That battle could herald a major showdown between the executive and legislative branches testing the separation of powers spelled out in the U.S. Constitution. The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators. Waters and Schiff in a joint statement called the lawsuit part of Trump’s “unprecedented stonewalling” of congressional oversight. In the complaint, the plaintiffs said House leaders ignored constitutional limits on Congress’ power to investigate, and any probe needed to further some “legitimate legislative purpose” and could not be an end in itself. They also said the subpoenas violated the plaintiffs’ privacy rights, and the refusal of House committees to even provide copies of the subpoenas to the plaintiffs made it impossible to know, or negotiate, their scope or breadth. Deutsche Bank stood almost alone in extending credit and managing money for Trump before he became president, as other banks avoided him because of his poor track record in paying back loans. The German lender has extended a substantial amount of capital to the Trump Organization in the past decade, according to documents and media reports. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank. In March, the New York Times detailed other financial relationships, including more than $2 billion of property loans and private banking services.

110,Trump directs officials to toughen asylum rules - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:51 AM / in 6 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump directed officials to toughen rules for asylum seekers on Monday, including by introducing a fee for their applications and barring those who entered the country illegally from working until their claims are approved. The moves are the latest effort by the Trump administration to stem a growing number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border, many of whom then seek asylum in the United States. Many of the changes would be dramatic shifts in how asylum seekers are treated, but would also require time-intensive regulatory procedures before they go into effect, which will likely take months. Trump administration officials have repeatedly blamed U.S. laws protecting asylum seekers for encouraging fraudulent or non-deserving claims. But immigrant advocates say the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict asylum protections harms people legitimately seeking refuge from violence and persecution.  On Monday, Trump signed a presidential memorandum that directed the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security to, within 90 days, introduce a slew of new regulations tightening asylum policy, including one setting a fee for asylum applications, which are currently free to file. Even a small fee could be insurmountable for many asylum seekers, said Victoria Neilson, a former official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the government agency that accepts asylum applications. “The majority of people coming to the United States seeking asylum are coming with little more than the shirts on their back,” she said. Another regulation Trump ordered his officials to prepare would ensure asylum claims are adjudicated in immigration court within six months.  U.S. law already directs the Justice Department to finish asylum cases within six months, but with a backlog of more than 800,000 cases, asylum claims often take years to come to a conclusion. “The provision to process cases in 180 days has been on the books for over two decades,” said Ashley Tabaddor, president of the immigration judges’ union. “The problem is that we have never been given adequate resources to adjudicate those claims in a timely fashion.” Asylum cases are often complex and involve trauma, and judges should have discretion to provide more time depending on the case, Tabaddor said. Trump also ordered officials to introduce regulations that would disqualify asylum seekers who entered the country illegally from obtaining work permits while their claims are pending. Currently, asylum seekers who enter both legally and illegally are allowed to work while their claims wind through the courts. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials encountered some 100,000 people at the U.S.-Mexico border in March, the highest level in more than a decade, and one which officials say is pushing resources to the breaking point.  Under U.S. law, asylum seekers that have a credible fear of return can seek review in immigration courts. The large majority of asylum seekers eventually lose their cases but can live in and work in the United States for the months or years it takes to process their claims.  Monday’s memorandum is just Trump’s latest attempt to curb asylum protections. Other policy moves have been challenged in federal court.
