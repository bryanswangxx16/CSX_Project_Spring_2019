1,Fed's Clarida says there's no good case for rate hikes or cuts: Bloomberg - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  2:34 PM / in 3 minutes","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve does not see a good case for raising or lowering interest rates and its current policy stance could help inflation move toward the central bank’s 2 percent target, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Tuesday. “We don’t see a strong case to move rates in either direction,” Clarida told Bloomberg television, largely echoing comments made last week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “Monetary policy is in a good place right now.” The Fed held interest rates steady last week and policymakers have been stressing the central bank will be “patient” in making any changes to policy. A few policymakers, however, have recently expressed concern over persistently low inflation and have indicated that rate cuts might eventually be needed. Clarida, however, said there were signs the recent weakness in inflation was driven by temporary factors and over time prices would move in line with the Fed’s target. “It’s going to be an important priority of policy to get us to 2 percent inflation,” Clarida said, saying the Fed would adjust policy as needed to get to its objective.

5,"UPDATE 1-Sterling slides to day's low on Brexit nerves, pressure on PM May - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  2:27 PM / in a minute","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv (Recasts, adds details) By Tom Finn LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - Sterling slid nearly half a percent on Monday on rising concerns about the progress of Brexit negotiations and worries Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a mounting challenge to her leadership. May is set to meet Graham Brady, chairman of an influential committee representing members of parliament from her Conservative party, amid calls for her to set a date to step down, the BBC reported. “Currently Theresa May is walking on thin ice as the latest reports indicate a revolt against her could take place. MPs (Members of parliament) are probably not satisfied with cross-party talks so far. Therefore the pound is being dragged down as another dose of uncertainty hits the market,” said Marc-André Fongern of MAF Global Forex. The British currency was generally weak across the board, reserving some of its biggest losses against the dollar and the low yielding Japanese yen. Against the dollar, the pound slipped as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3040 before recovering slightly to trade 0.4 percent down at $1.3051. It also weakened a quarter of a percent against the euro at 85.69 pence and 0.7 percent against the yen at 144.21 yen. A dollar rising at the start of the U.S. trading session also hit the pound. “There is broad dollar strength across the board but it is being felt more acutely through sterling,” said Kamal Sharma, a director of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Britain’s Conservative government and the opposition Labour Party resumed Brexit talks to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament over the country’s departure from the European Union. May agreed a withdrawal deal with the EU last year, but it was rejected three times by a deeply divided British parliament. That delayed the exit date, a postponement that has weighed on the pound as investors fret about prolonged political uncertainty. Sterling has traded in a narrow range of $1.28-$1.31 since Britain pushed its scheduled departure from the European Union back from March until Oct. 31. There is still little clarity about when, how, or even if, Brexit will happen. Investors have been broadly impervious to tepid economic data recently and even relatively hawkish comments from the Bank of England last week failed to jolt the currency. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows and net positions by hedge funds in sterling have slipped back into negative territory.

7,Wall Street declines on U.S.-China trade tensions - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  11:08 AM / Updated 13 minutes ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted broad-based declines on Tuesday, led by tariff-sensitive industrial companies, as renewed worries over trade negotiations with China stoked global growth worries and kept investors away from risky assets.   Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States this week for trade talks, Beijing said on Tuesday, playing down a sharp increase in tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose new tariffs. Trump in a surprise move on Sunday said the higher levies would go into effect on Friday if a deal with China was not sealed, triggering a global selloff in equities and inflamed fears of a slowdown in global growth. “There is some uncertainty on what the ultimate result of the trade negotiations will be. If there is no deal that will be interpreted quite negatively by markets,” said Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. All the major S&P sectors were trading lower, with the industrial sector, posting the steepest decline of 1.6%. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, slipped 1.8% and Caterpillar Inc declined 1.3%. Boeing’s stock was also weighed by report of a Barclays downgrade to “equal weight”.     Trade tensions also pressured oil prices, pushed U.S. Treasury yields lower and halted a recent rally that propelled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs.  Interest rate sensitive banking stocks dropped 1.49% and the broader financial sector fell 1.18%. Adding to growth worries, the European Commission revised down euro area growth forecasts and cut its already gloomy outlook on Italy. At 9:53 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 284.00 points, or 1.07%, at 26,154.48. The S&P 500 was down 32.81 points, or 1.12%, at 2,899.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 94.62 points, or 1.16%, at 8,028.67. High growth companies including Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc fell more than 1% and weighed on markets. The earnings season has now reached its homestretch. Of the 392 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, about 75% have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimates for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise, a huge improvement from the 2.3% decline expected at the start of the earnings season. American International Group Inc jumped 7.7%, the most among S&P companies, after the insurer reported a quarterly profit that blew past expectations. Among decliners, Mylan NV tumbled 10.8% after the drugmaker missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue, hurt partly by manufacturing problems at its Morgantown plant in West Virginia. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc fell 6% after the drugmaker missed quarterly profit estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 4.31-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.85-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 29 new highs and 15 new lows.

10,Senate's McConnell to declare 'case closed' on Mueller report as Democrats eye contempt - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  1:25 PM / in an hour","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The divided U.S. Congress’ fight over the Mueller report intensified on Tuesday as the U.S. Senate’s top Republican sought to shut the door on congressional probes while House Democrats pushed ahead with efforts to gather testimony from top administration officials.  U.S. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, in a speech set for later Tuesday, planned to declare the ""case closed"" after Special Counsel Robert Mueller here released his findings on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.  “This investigation went on for two years. It’s finally over,” McConnell said in prepared remarks. He called Mueller’s work “exhaustive” and chided elected officials for failing to unify in its aftermath.  “Would we finally be able to move on from partisan paralysis and breathless conspiracy theorizing? Or would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship,” McConnell said in excerpts of his planned speech. “Regrettably, I think the answer is obvious.” Meanwhile, House Democrats prepared to meet with Justice Department officials on Tuesday over Attorney General William Barr’s failure to release the full unredacted Mueller report as they prepared to cite him for contempt. The House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a Wednesday vote on a contempt citation for Barr, who missed a second deadline to give lawmakers the full report and failed to appear at a hearing before the panel last week.  The full Democratically controlled House would then vote on the rebuke.     Former White House counsel Don McGahn could also face a contempt citation if he misses today’s deadline to respond to the judiciary committee, CNN reported, citing an unnamed source. The panel has subpoenaed him for documents and called for him to testify later this month.  A contempt citation could lead to a civil court case, raising the possibility of fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. The judiciary panel is among several congressional committees investigating Trump and his administration on multiple issues, including the Russia investigation and Trump’s personal and business tax returns. The administration is stonewalling the probes while the president, who has denied any wrongdoing, vowed to fight all congressional subpoenas. On Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin denied the House Ways and Means Committee’s request for Trump’s tax returns, teeing up a likely legal battle. The president’s fellow Republicans, who control the Senate, have rejected the investigations as political theater ahead of the 2020 election.  The Mueller report detailed extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Moscow, but did not find a conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign. It also described actions that Trump took to try to impede Mueller’s investigation.     Democratic lawmakers also want Mueller to testify before Congress, something Trump has balked at although Barr has said he would not object.  If lawmakers decide that Trump obstructed justice by seeking to impede Mueller, the judiciary panel, chaired by Representative Jerry Nadler, could move to impeachment proceedings against the president.

11,U.S. House panel readies contempt vote against Barr over Mueller report - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  5:02 AM / Updated 11 hours ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats moved closer on Monday to citing Attorney General William Barr for contempt of Congress over his failure to give them an unredacted version of the Mueller report, escalating a showdown with the White House. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee released a report citing Barr, an appointee of President Donald Trump, for contempt of Congress after the expiration of a second deadline to produce the full report. Barr also skipped a hearing before the committee last week.             The panel will vote on whether to move ahead with a contempt citation on Wednesday, and if it does so, the full House will vote on the issue.  Barr has released a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report here on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler subpoenaed the full document and underlying evidence, setting an initial deadline that Barr missed last week. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said he was disappointed with the committee’s contempt move and invited committee staff to the Justice Department to discuss a possible compromise on Wednesday afternoon, after the committee’s expected vote. Later, Nadler said in a statement that Justice Department officials had agreed to shift the meeting to Tuesday. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Trump administration is stonewalling multiple probes by House committees.  A contempt citation could lead to a civil court case against Barr, raising the possibility of fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. Some Democrats on Nadler’s panel say lawmakers could also exercise their own little-used “inherent” authority to act outside the U.S. judicial system to apprehend, fine and even imprison officials who do not comply with congressional subpoenas. “The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena ... leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings,” Nadler said in a statement. But he held out the possibility that Barr could avoid contempt by making a “good faith” offer for access to the material. Republicans reject Nadler’s efforts as political theater, which they say is intended to satisfy the Democrats’ voters. “Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Representative Doug Collins, top Republican on the committee, said in a statement.   Some Democrats have called on Barr to resign, accusing him of protecting Trump by effectively clearing the president of criminal obstruction of justice and excusing actions viewed by them as evidence of misconduct. Nadler’s committee views the full Mueller report as vital to its own corruption and obstruction of justice investigation of Trump. The chairs of five other House committees investigating the president have also called for its release.         The Mueller report details extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Moscow, but did not find that there was a conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign. The report also describes actions Trump took to try to impede Mueller’s investigation.      If lawmakers established that Trump obstructed justice by seeking to impede Mueller, Nadler’s panel could move to impeachment proceedings against the president. Trump denied any wrongdoing in a tweet on Monday. “Also, there are ‘No High Crimes & Misdemeanors,’ No Collusion, No Conspiracy, No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE, and that’s what the Dems should be looking at, but they won’t. Nevertheless, the tables are turning!” the president wrote on Twitter.

12,"Explainer: How hard-hitting are U.S. Congress subpoenas, contempt citations? - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  7:32 PM / Updated 12 hours ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr faces the prospect on Wednesday of a vote by a U.S. House committee to hold him in “contempt of Congress.” What does that mean? Congress has significant, if time-consuming, powers to demand witnesses and documents. One of these is the contempt citation. Democrats in the House of Representatives are threatening to use it on multiple fronts, including against Barr for ignoring a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee seeking an unredacted version of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and President Donald Trump. Trump and his administration are stonewalling several inquiries being led by House Democrats into his administration, his family and his business interests. Here is how the congressional subpoena, contempt and enforcement process works. What is a subpoena? A subpoena is a legally enforceable demand for documents, data, or witness testimony. Subpoenas are typically used by litigants in court cases. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress’s power to issue subpoenas, saying in order to write laws it also needs to be able to investigate. Congress’ power to issue subpoenas, while broad, is not unlimited. The high court has said Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and cannot investigate someone purely to expose wrongdoing or damaging information about them for political gain. A subpoena must potentially further some “legitimate legislative purpose,” the court has said. What can Congress do to a government official who ignores a subpoena?  If lawmakers want to punish someone who ignores a congressional subpoena they typically first hold the offender “in contempt of Congress,” legal experts said. The contempt process can start in either the House or the Senate. Unlike with legislation, it only takes one of the chambers to make and enforce a contempt citation.   Typically, the members of the congressional committee that issued the subpoena will vote on whether to move forward with a contempt finding. If a majority supports the resolution, then another vote will be held by the entire chamber. The Democrats have majority control of the House; Trump’s Republican Party holds the Senate. Only a majority of the 435-member House needs to support a contempt finding for one to be reached. After a contempt vote, Congress has powers to enforce a subpoena. How is a contempt finding enforced? The Supreme Court said in 1821 that Congress has “inherent authority” to arrest and detain recalcitrant witnesses.  In 1927, the high court said the Senate acted lawfully in sending its deputy sergeant-at-arms to Ohio to arrest and detain the brother of the then-attorney general, who had refused to testify about a bribery scheme known as the Teapot Dome scandal.   It has been almost a century since Congress exercised this arrest-and-detain authority, and the practice is unlikely to make a comeback, legal experts said. Alternatively, Congress can ask the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a federal prosecutor, to bring criminal charges against a witness who refuses to appear. There is a criminal law that specifically prohibits flouting a congressional subpoena. But this option is also unlikely to be pursued, at least when it comes to subpoenas against executive branch officials, given that federal prosecutors are part of the branch’s Justice Department.  “It would be odd, structurally, because it would mean the Trump administration would be acting to enforce subpoenas against the Trump administration,” said Lisa Kern Griffin, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Duke University.  For this reason, in modern times Congress has opted for a third and final approach to enforcing a contempt finding: getting its lawyers to bring a civil lawsuit asking a judge to rule that compliance is required.  Failure to comply with such an order can trigger a “contempt of court” finding, enforced through daily fines and even imprisonment, Griffin said.

Rowe Price, SoftBank - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  1:09 PM / in 16 minutes","2 Min Read(Reuters) - General Motors Co’s majority-owned Cruise self-driving division on Tuesday said T. Rowe Price and a group of existing investors put down $1.15 billion in new equity, valuing the unit at $19 billion. Shares of the No.1 U.S. automaker rose as much as 2.1 percent to $38.89 in morning trading following the announcement. The latest funding round includes General Motors, Japan’s SoftBank Vision Fund and Honda Motor Co Ltd, and should give the firm much needed cash as it aims to launch vehicles by the end of 2019. The additional capital comes at a crucial time as a host of automakers and technology companies weigh how quickly autonomous vehicles can be marketed and sold in large volumes, and find ways to share rising costs for hardware and software development.  Rival Ford Motor Co is in talks with German automaker Volkswagen AG about joining forces to create autonomous vehicles in a deal that could involve an investment by VW in Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle technology company majority owned by Ford. Cruise, which has secured capital commitments of $7.25 billion in the past year, was valued at $14.6 billion in the last funding round by Honda in October, which had invested  $2.75 billion. The current valuation is equivalent to about 35 percent of GM’s market capitalization despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch.

17,"UPDATE 1-Italy's debt to climb as economy stalls, shedding jobs -EU - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  2:08 PM / in 31 minutes","4 Min Read* Brussels downgrades could reignite budget dispute * Says Italy economy to grow 0.1 pct this year, lagging bloc * EU says debt, deficit to rise far above fiscal ceilings (adds Moscovici, details, Italy estimates) By Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS, May 7 (Reuters) - Italy’s huge debt pile is expected to rise higher this year as the country’s economy limps along, the European Commission said on Tuesday in quarterly forecasts that could reignite a dispute with Rome over its budget. Brussels cut its 2019 growth outlook for Italy to 0.1 percent from an already gloomy 0.2 percent. The economy expanded 0.9 percent last year. The commission also said it expected growth in the wider euro zone economy to slow more than previously estimated, to 1.2 percent. But its forecast for Italy is the lowest in the bloc, and the Commission said it expected that to weigh on the country’s public finances, with debt and deficit seen climbing far beyond what is allowed under EU fiscal rules. The Commission’s forecasts were drawn up before data showed Italy emerged from recession in the first quarter with stronger-than-expected growth of 0.2 percent, and the government says its policies to increase welfare benefits will support domestic demand. Although no EU decision over possible disciplinary moves is expected before European elections on May 23-26, the more downbeat estimates could increase market pressure on a coalition government in Rome already plagued by infighting. The commission - which came close to penalising Italy over an excessive deficit target before the two side reached an agreement in December - will assess states’ compliance with EU rules at the beginning of June, economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici said. Without policy changes, Italy’s deficit would be 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year and would climb to 3.5 percent in 2020, beyond the EU’s 3.0 percent ceiling, the bloc’s executive estimated. The government has forecast a deficit of 2.5 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2020. The commission expects Italy’s debt to grow to 133.7 percent of GDP this year and peak at 135.2 percent in 2020. Euro zone countries with a debt rate above 60 percent are required to gradually reduce it. But Italy’s has been growing since last year, when it cost 3.7 percent of economic output to service. With Italian bond yields having dropped slightly after December’s budget deal with Brussels, interest expenditure is forecast to drop to 3.6 percent of GDP this year, before rising again in 2020. The structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and the effects of the business cycle, is also expected to worsen. This indicator is crucial in the EU assessment over countries’ compliance with fiscal rules. The primary surplus, which excludes interest payments, is expected to ease. Italy is the only euro zone country in which the commission expects employment to fall this year, by 0.1 percent. The government has also forecast that employment will decline this year. Both Brussels and Rome expect it to rise in 2020. Brussels also singled out Italy as the only state where investments will fall, by an estimated 0.3 percent. Italy’s fiscal outlook could worsen if yields rose again, but would improve if spending was reduced and a planned rise of sales tax was applied next year, the Commission said.

19,"U.S. sending carrier, bombers to Mideast is psychological warfare: Iran - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  8:19 AM / Updated 32 minutes ago","4 Min ReadDUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s top security body dismissed as “psychological warfare” a U.S. announcement that a carrier strike group and bombers are being sent to the Middle East as a message to Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday. Tensions rose on the eve of the anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Tehran is likely to revive part of its halted nuclear program on Wednesday in response to the U.S. move but does not plan to pull out of the agreement itself, state media said. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Sunday the United States was deploying the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force to the Middle East in a warning over alleged threats by Iranian forces. “Bolton’s statement is a clumsy use of a burnt-out happening for (the purpose of) psychological warfare,” Tasnim quoted Keyvan Khosravi, spokesman for the Supreme National Security Council, as saying. Khosravi said the carrier had arrived in the Mediterranean weeks ago. Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Monday he had approved dispatching the carrier strike group and bombers due to indications of a “credible threat by Iranian regime forces”. He gave no details of underlying intelligence. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter: “If U.S. and clients don’t feel safe, it’s because they’re despised by the people of the region - blaming Iran won’t reverse that.”  Iran’s state-run Press TV earlier said: “The deployment seems to be a ‘regularly scheduled’ one by the U.S. Navy, and Bolton has just tried to talk it up.” Separately, a military adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asserted that the United States was “neither willing nor capable” of military action against Iran, the semi-official news agency ISNA reported.  Brigadier General Hossein Dehgan said Washington would have a hard time convincing world opinion and regional countries to accept an all-out war against Iran, and to mobilize resources for such a conflict.  Iranian newspapers and commentators have dismissed Washington’s announcement as a “bluff” and “empty rhetoric”. However, as jitters over the war of words rose, Iran’s rial currency extended its fall on Tuesday, hovering around a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market, foreign exchange websites reported. The rial declined to 154,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, compared to 150,500 rials on Monday, touching its lowest value since early October 2018, according to Bonbast.com.  Last week, President Donald Trump’s administration said it would end waivers for countries buying Iranian oil in an attempt to reduce Iran’s crude exports to zero following Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal. The administration also blacklisted Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iran said last month it was prepared for a U.S. decision to end the waivers as the Revolutionary Guards repeated a threat to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if Tehran were barred from using it.  Around 30 percent of the world’s seaborne oil exports is shipped through the strait. While neither Shanahan nor Bolton elaborated on the gist of U.S. intelligence, other U.S. officials told Reuters there were “multiple, credible threats” against U.S. forces on land, including in Iraq, by Iran and proxy forces and at sea.

24,"Trump says he, Putin discussed new nuclear pact possibly including China - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  4:03 PM / 3 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday the possibility of a new accord limiting nuclear arms that could eventually include China in what would be a major deal between the globe’s top three atomic powers. Trump, speaking to reporters as he met in the Oval Office with Peter Pellegrini, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, also said he and Putin discussed efforts to persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, the political discord in Venezuela, and Ukraine during a call that stretched over an hour. The 2011 New START treaty, the only U.S.-Russia arms control pact limiting deployed strategic nuclear weapons, expires in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree. Without the agreement, it could be harder to gauge each other’s intentions, arms control advocates say. Trump cited the expense of keeping up the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a motivating factor behind wanting to limit how many weapons are deployed. “We’re talking about a nuclear agreement where we make less and they make less and maybe where we get rid of some of the tremendous firepower that we have right now,” he said. Trump said China during trade talks had “felt very strongly” about joining the United States and Russia in limiting nuclear weapons. “So I think we’re going to probably start up something very shortly between Russia and ourselves maybe to start off, and I think China will be added down the road. We’ll be talking about non-proliferation, we’ll be talking about a nuclear deal of some kind, and I think it’ll be a very comprehensive one,” he said. The New START treaty required the United States and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades, and limit delivery systems - land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. It also includes extensive transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carry out 10 inspections of strategic nuclear bases each year; give 48 hours notice before new missiles covered by the treaty leave their factories; and provide notifications before ballistic missile launches. Trump has called the New START treaty concluded by his predecessor, Barack Obama, a “bad deal” and “one-sided.” The Kremlin said the two sides confirmed they intended to “activate dialogue in various spheres, including strategic security.” The two men, who last chatted informally at a dinner of world leaders in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, briefly talked about the report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller that concluded Trump did not collude with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. Putin seemed amused, said Trump. “He said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain, and it ended up being a mouse. But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. Pretty much that’s what it was,” he said. The Kremlin said the call was initiated by Washington. It said the two leaders agreed to maintain contacts on different levels and expressed satisfaction with the “businesslike and constructive nature” of the conversation. With the United States concerned about a Russian military presence in Venezuela at a time when Washington wants Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to leave power, Trump told Putin “the United States stands with the people of Venezuela” and stressed he wanted to get relief supplies into the country, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Putin told Trump that any external interference in Venezuela’s internal business undermines the prospects of a political end to the crisis, the Kremlin said. The two leaders discussed Ukraine. Trump canceled a summit meeting with Putin late last year after Russia seized three Ukrainian Navy ships on Nov. 25 and arrested 24 sailors. Putin also told Trump that the new leadership in Ukraine should take steps to solve the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin said. Trump also raised with Putin the issue of getting North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Trump has met twice with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but Kim has yet to agree to a disarmament deal. Sanders said Trump mentioned several times “the need and importance of Russia stepping up and continuing to put pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.” The Kremlin said both leaders highlighted the need to pursue denuclearization of the region. During an April summit with Kim in Vladivostok, Putin expressed Russian support for a gradual process of trading disarmament for sanctions relief.

25,House Democrats seek to intervene against Trump lawsuit over bank subpoenas - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:55 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Two committees of the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked to intervene in a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization seeking to block House subpoenas seeking financial records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, the Committee on Financial Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said they needed to intervene in the lawsuit in order to “defend their significant interests in the enforcement of their subpoenas” as part of “investigations on issues of national significance.”  In a separate filing on Friday, Trump, his children and his company asked U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos for a preliminary order blocking the banks from responding to the subpoenas while their lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, is pending. They said they will suffer “irreparable harm” without such an order, and that the subpoenas appeared to be intended to expose their confidential financial information “for the sake of exposure.” “That purpose is illegitimate and provides no constitutional footing for the subpoenas,” they said. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank. Democratic lawmakers had asked Capital One’s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump’s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests.   In their lawsuit, Trump, a Republican, and the other plaintiffs accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose in hopes they would “stumble upon something” they could use as a political weapon against Trump. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and has said “we’re fighting all the subpoenas” issued by the House. The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators.

26,Pressure grows on Attorney General Barr over Mueller - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:29 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and a senior U.S. House Democrat tightened the screws on U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday over the Mueller report, making new demands on him after an already tough week for the Justice Department chief. Trump said it will be up to Barr to decide whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller, author of the report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which wants to hear from him. Earlier in the day, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler set a new deadline of Monday at 9 a.m. for Barr to comply with a subpoena seeking an unredacted version of the report before moving to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. The two developments ensured that Barr, Mueller and his report will remain in sharp focus next week in Washington, where Congress and Trump are on a collision course over investigations being led by Nadler and other committee leaders. At the White House, speaking to reporters, Trump was asked whether he would let Mueller testify to the Senate panel. The president responded, “That’s up to our attorney general.” Barr, who was appointed by Trump, testified on Wednesday for four hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He took heavy criticism for it from congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of misrepresenting the findings of Mueller’s much-anticipated two-year investigation. The same committee now wants to talk to Mueller. His 448-page report unearthed many links between Russians and Trump’s campaign, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow. It also described attempts by Trump to obstruct Mueller’s probe, but did not say whether Trump had committed a crime.    Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, wrote to Mueller to ask whether he wanted to appear before his panel to discuss any misstatements Barr may have made about the special counsel’s investigation. The special counsel’s office would not comment on Graham’s invitation. In a letter to Barr, House Judiciary Chairman Nadler set the 9 a.m. Monday deadline for Barr to comply with the subpoena demanding the unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence from the Mueller probe. He also offered to negotiate further to gain the Justice Department’s cooperation, but made clear what would be at stake if Barr refused. “If the department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena, the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse,” the New York Democrat wrote. The Justice Department declined to comment. Barr on April 18 released a redacted version of the Mueller report. Nadler subpoenaed the entire document a day later. If Barr does not comply, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to move forward on Monday with a contempt citation that could ultimately lead to a civil court case against Barr, followed by fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. Also on Friday, Trump said he will decide in coming days whether he will let former White House lawyer Don McGahn testify to Congress. Mueller’s report said McGahn told investigators that Trump contacted him in an attempt to get Mueller fired.

29,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-German bond yields, Italy bank shares down on European Commission forecasts - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  1:13 PM / Updated an hour ago","3 Min Read(Corrects Italy/Germany spread in fourth bullet point to 263 not 163, no change to text) * German 10-year yield falls to 5-wk low of -0.04 pct * EC says EZ growth at 1.2 pct, from 1.3 pct in Feb * Italy’s debt to grow as economy slows, EC says * Italy/Germany bond yield gap widens to 263 bps By Virginia Furness LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - German government bond yields hit five-week lows on Tuesday and Italian shares fell, led by the country’s banking index, after the European Commission revised down euro area growth forecasts and cut its already gloomy outlook on Italy. The euro zone economy will rebound next year from a slow-down in 2019 and unemployment will fall further, but inflation is likely to stay at this year’s levels and below the European Central Bank’s target, the European Commission said on Tuesday. It forecast domestic euro zone growth of 1.2 percent this year, slower than the 1.3 percent it predicted in February. The report prompted further buying of German government bonds — after an apparent deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade relations led investors to buy safe haven assets on Monday — and pushed yields down to a five-week low of -0.04 percent . Other core bond yields in the bloc were also around three basis points lower. The Commission also cut Italy’s growth forecast to 0.1 percent, down from 0.2 percent and said the country’s deficit could widen further beyond the 3 percent ceiling set by the European Union. Italian government bond yields initially rose to 2.6 percent before pulling back to 2.58 percent, up just one basis point on the day. While the reaction in Italian bond was muted, the Germany/Italy bond yield spread widened to its most since April 26 at 263 basis points. “The Italy spread did widen on the release of the forecast but there’s been a mini recovery,” said Peter Chatwell, a strategist at Mizuho in london. “The EU don’t seem to be telling us anything we don’t know, but the market is using that as a catalyst to re-price.” Italian shares fell into negative territory, with the banking index 1.7 percent lower at 1208 GMT as investors focussed on the deficit forecast. With no changes in the government’s spending policies, the country’s deficit is set to grow to 2.5 percent of output this year and climb to 3.5 percent in 2020, beyond the 3.0 percent ceiling set by EU fiscal rules, the EC said. “Clearly that is way beyond what will be deemed acceptable and that has seen the underperformance of Italy,” said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank.

31,"With low expectations, Conservatives and Labour resume Brexit talks - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  6:43 AM / Updated an hour ago","4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Conservative government and the opposition Labour Party resume Brexit talks on Tuesday to try to find a way to break the deadlock in parliament over the country’s departure from the European Union. After Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times and she was forced to delay Brexit, the government has spent more than four weeks in talks with Labour - negotiations that have done little to soften positions in either party. So far, there has been no agreement between Britain’s main parties and few held out any hope of a breakthrough on Tuesday. But with the clock ticking down before European elections, when both parties could face more bruising results after local polls last week, time is running out. Almost three years since Britain voted to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how, when or even if Brexit will happen. Addressing her cabinet team of ministers, May bolstered her argument for talks with Labour by saying last week’s local elections, when the Conservatives lost hundreds of council seats, underlined the need to get on with Brexit. “The prime minister said that while an agreement with the opposition had not been reached, the public had sent a clear message in the local elections that they want both of the main parties to get on with delivering Brexit,” her spokesman said she told ministers. Some pro-EU lawmakers say the local elections showed the tide was turning against Brexit after the Liberal Democrats, which supports a second referendum, gained many council seats. The spokesman said a further negotiation session would take place on Tuesday afternoon starting about 4 p.m. (1500 GMT). But on both sides of the talks, there was little suggestion that this would offer a breakthrough, rather that they wanted to see whether there was a sense that any agreement could be found and on what kind of timetable. Neither party wants to contest the elections to the European Parliament on May 23, when they fear voters will again punish them by voting for alternative parties after showing their frustration at local elections last week. Conservative Brexit supporters might flock to the newly launched Brexit Party of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, while Labour pro-EU campaigners might look to Change UK, another new party, or support the Liberal Democrats. But with both parties, like much of the country, deeply divided over Brexit, any breakthrough might be hard to come by.  Labour sources were dismissive over weekend reports the government would offer new concessions, including temporary customs union with the EU until a national election due in June 2022, saying such a proposal would not go far enough. John McDonnell, Corbyn ally and Labour’s finance policy chief, also accused the government of undermining the confidentiality of the talks by briefing the proposal - something that was denied by May’s spokesman. That offer was quickly played down by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said he did not believe a post-Brexit customs union would offer “a sustainable long-term solution”. “I want to look at whatever deal is come to between the parties and I know this is a crucial week,” he told BBC radio.

33,"Trade worries keep shares weak, Turkey reels again - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  1:33 AM / Updated 2 hours ago","5 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest threat to ramp up trade tariffs on China kept global share markets weak on Tuesday, while Turkey’s lira was back in trouble as concerns about its politics erupted again. Europe’s main bourses and Wall Street futures were firmly back in the red after Trump’s threat on Monday to ratchet up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods triggered the biggest global sell-off since March.  [.EU] It had been a broadly steady start but that had made way for more selling. London was down more than 1 percent as it played catch-up after a long weekend, but Frankfurt, Paris and the pan-European STOXX 600 were down 0.6-0.8 percent too. [.EU] Some investors were still hoping that Trump’s moves were a negotiating tactic, especially after Beijing confirmed that its top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, would go to Washington for talks on Thursday and Friday as planned.   Though Japan’s Nikkei took a delayed hit of 1.5 percent having been closed for over a week [.T], MSCI’s main global and Asia indexes largely held their ground overnight as Chinese shares also recovered from their worst drop in more than three years. [.SS] “We expect the situation to de-escalate as the issue seems solvable and Liu He, China’s lead negotiator, is continuing with his plans to travel to Washington D.C. for talks this week,” said Oxford Economics economist Louis Kuijs. “Nonetheless, the probability of renewed escalation of the U.S.-China trade war has risen substantially, which would be a drag on their respective economies, especially on China.” Following Trump’s tariff warning, U.S. officials accused China of backtracking on substantial commitments made during the months of negotiations between the two countries. Beijing’s response to the prospect of new tariffs has been reserved, and on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing that mutual respect was the basis for reaching a trade agreement. “Adding tariffs can’t resolve any problem,” Geng said. “Talks are by their nature a process of discussion. It’s normal for both sides to have differences. China won’t shun problems and is sincere about continuing talks,” he added. China’s yuan had recouped some of its early Asia session losses against the dollar but it remained hobbled near 2-1/2 month lows in the international ‘offshore’ markets at 6.7833 yuan per dollar.[/FRX]  (For a graphic on 'U.S.-China trade and GDP comparison' click tmsnrt.rs/2VNqSrW) There was plenty more keeping traders busy too. Australia’s dollar jumped almost 1 percent to a one-week top of $0.7048, after the country’s central bank kept rates on hold, wrongfooting some who had expected it to cut. [/FRX] Other major currencies remained confined to well-trodden ranges, with the dollar steady at 110.63 yen and the euro trading virtually flat at $1.1195 despite new European Commission forecasts highlighting Italy’s debt worries. With no changes in the government’s spending policies, Italy’s budget deficit is also set to grow, to 2.5 percent of output this year and to 3.5 percent in 2020, beyond the 3.0 percent ceiling set by EU fiscal rules. In emerging markets, the Turkish lira came under renewed heavy fire after the country’s elections board decided to cancel a municipal election in Istanbul and order a re-run. It slid as much as 1.5 percent and past the 6.15 per dollar threshold, which also sent Istanbul’s stock market and government bonds tumbling badly too. “The rule of law is under scrutiny by markets,” UniCredit EM FX strategist Kiran Kowshik said.  “It is also clear that Turkish reserves are depleted and there are questions about whether Turkey can weather its immediate challenges without an external anchor like the IMF.” In the commodity markets, oil dropped around 1 percent as the renewed doubts over U.S.-China trade talks offset the potential supply worries of U.S. sanctions on crude exporters Iran and Venezuela. [O/R] Back on Wall Street, digger giant Caterpillar, which is often seen as a proxy for China’s fortunes, dipped 0.6 percent in pre-market trading. Tariff-sensitive Boeing fell 1.4 percent too as talk of a downgrade from Barclays also hit the planemaker’s stock. [.N].  The U.S. earnings season is now in the homestretch and of the 392 S&P companies that have reported so far, about 75 percent have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have also turned around earnings estimates for the first quarter to an almost 1 percent rise, a huge improvement from the 2.3 percent decline expected at the start of the season last month.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States this week for trade talks, Beijing said on Tuesday, playing down a sudden increase in tensions after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to impose new tariffs. Trump in a surprise move on Sunday said the higher levies would go into effect on Friday if no deal with China was sealed, which triggered a global sell-off in equities and inflamed fears of a slowdown in global growth. “There is some uncertainty on what the ultimate result of the trade negotiations will be. If there is no deal that will be interpreted quite negatively by markets,” said Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Tariff-sensitive Boeing Co fell 1.2% in premarket trading, while Caterpillar Inc declined 1.1%. Boeing’s stock was also weighed by report of a Barclays downgrade to “equal weight”. Trade tensions also sent oil prices lower and halted a recent rally that propelled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs. The benchmark index is nearly 1% away from its all-time high of 2,954.13. Adding to the downbeat mood, the European Commission said Italy’s huge debt is expected to grow further this year and the next as the country’s growth remains sluggish. At 8:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 158 points, or 0.6%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 19 points, or 0.65% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 61.5 points, or 0.79%. Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp fell 0.5% and Chevron Corp was off 0.3%. The earnings season has now reached its homestretch. Of the 392 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, about 75% have surpassed analysts’ estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimates for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise, a huge improvement from the 2.3% decline expected at the start of the earnings season. American International Group Inc jumped 4.8% after the insurer reported a quarterly profit that blew past expectations and posted its first underwriting profit since the financial crisis. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc fell 4.1% after the drugmaker missed quarterly profit estimates. On the macro front, a Labor Department report is likely to show U.S. job openings increasing to 7.240 million in March, after it fell to 7.087 million in February. The data is due at 10:00 a.m. ET.

38,Exclusive: Foreign government leases at Trump World Tower stir more emoluments concerns - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  10:09 AM / 4 days ago","11 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department allowed seven foreign governments to rent luxury condominiums in New York’s Trump World Tower in 2017 without approval from Congress, according to documents and people familiar with the leases, in what some experts say could be a potential violation of the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause. The Manhattan building, part of the real estate empire of Donald Trump, had housed diplomats and foreign officials before the property developer became president. But now that he is in the White House, such transactions must be approved by federal lawmakers, some legal experts say. The emoluments clause bans U.S. officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional consent. The rental transactions, dating from the early months of Trump’s presidency and first disclosed by Reuters, could add to mounting scrutiny of his business dealings with foreign governments, which are now the subject of multiple lawsuits. Congressional staffers confirmed to Reuters that the Trump World Tower lease requests were never submitted to Congress. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said his committee has been “stonewalled” in its efforts to obtain detailed  information about foreign government payments to Trump’s businesses. “This new information raises serious questions about the President and his businesses’ potential receipt of payments from foreign governments,” Cummings said in a statement to Reuters. “The American public deserves full transparency.” A State Department spokesperson referred Reuters to the Justice Department because the subject involved “matters related to ongoing litigation.” The Justice Department declined to comment. The White House referred a request for comment to the State Department and the Trump Organization, which declined to comment before publication. Following publication of this article, Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten sent an email to Reuters describing the story as “inaccurate” and “misleading”. He said Trump World Tower is owned by its third-party condominium owners and therefore Trump would not receive proceeds from the lease of such units. Six legal experts said that regardless of who owns those units, the fact that Trump was collecting fees for managing the building while foreign governments were paying to live there represents a potential breach of the emoluments clause. Certain constitutional scholars counter that the definition of “emolument” should be more narrow, a view that Trump’s attorneys share. The 1982 Foreign Missions Act requires foreign governments to get State Department clearance for any purchase, lease, sale, or other use of a property in the United States. Through the Freedom of Information Act, Reuters obtained diplomatic notes sent to the agency under this requirement from early 2015 until late 2017. The records show that in the eight months following Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration, foreign governments sent 13 notes to the State Department seeking permission to rent or renew leases in Trump World Tower. That is more solicitations from foreign governments for new or renewed leases in that building than in the previous two years combined. The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases, according to other documents viewed by Reuters and people familiar with the leases. Five of those governments - Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the European Union - had also sought to rent units there in 2015 and 2016, State Department records showed.   Reuters could not confirm whether the State Department signed off on two other lease requests from Algeria and South Korea and three additional requests from Kuwait. “Letting this go without Congress knowing about it condones the creation of a second, opaque track of foreign policy,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor at Yale Law School and former legal adviser at the State Department. “What it might lead to is a group of countries enriching the people in power on the mistaken belief that it’s going to improve their access.” (For a graphic on foreign government leases at Trump World Tower, see: tmsnrt.rs/2DHJKOS) The 18-year-old luxury skyscraper is located next to the United Nations headquarters near the East River, and is not to be confused with Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue landmark where Trump maintains a residence.  Although Garten, the attorney, contended the emoluments question is moot because Trump World Tower units are owned by third parties, Trump does earn income through the Trump Corporation, a Trump-owned company that manages Trump World Tower and draws its income from fees paid by unit owners, according to the building’s financial records. In 2017, the president earned more than $15 million in management and related fees through the properties managed by the Trump Corporation, according to the president’s financial disclosure. The document did not reveal how much of that sum came from Trump World Tower. In at least eight instances in 2017, third-party owners in Trump World Tower leased their units to foreign governments. When privately-owned units are leased, their owners typically use that rental income to cover management fees and other common charges, according to two unit owners in Trump World Tower and four real estate experts interviewed by Reuters. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how the owners who leased the units to the foreign governments paid their fees. But even if the condominium owners did not use their rental income to pay their common charges, it still could be considered an emolument because the foreign governments helped those owners defray their costs, with the benefit flowing to Trump, according to Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of Law who has studied the history of Justice Department interpretations on the subject. In other words, Clark said, payments passing through a chain of intermediaries to a U.S. official could still constitute emoluments because they could ultimately enrich and influence the behavior of the official. In legal opinions issued under previous administrations, Clark said, “the Justice Department has expressed concern that foreign governments would use companies as conduits for foreign emoluments.” However, South Texas College of Law professor Josh Blackman said that foreign government payments that enrich a U.S. official should only constitute emoluments if they are “tied to the discharge of official duties.” He has filed briefs in each emoluments lawsuit against Trump endorsing this view. While U.S. presidents have rarely needed to seek approval of payments from foreign governments in the past, Trump’s continued ownership of his vast network of businesses has left him exposed to more potential emoluments issues than any previous U.S. president, according to legal and ethics experts. The revenue Trump draws from foreign government business at his properties, such as the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has sparked lawsuits by U.S. lawmakers and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, alleging this income violates the emoluments clause. Defining exactly what constitutes an emolument is at the heart of those cases. Trump’s attorneys have argued in court that the Constitution only requires him to seek congressional approval for foreign emoluments offered in connection with his role as president. Trump has retained ownership of his global business interests while president, but handed off day-to-day control to his oldest sons and a longtime company executive. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss one of the emoluments lawsuits against him, saying Trump’s narrow definition of emoluments was “unpersuasive and inconsistent”. Courts may ultimately decide whether some of Trump’s business dealings violate the Constitution. Issuing such judgments is not the job of the State Department office in charge of reviewing foreign government property requests, according to Patrick Kennedy, who from 2007 to 2017 was the top State Department official in charge of the internal administration of the agency. He said that office’s mandate is to screen for national security and diplomatic concerns, not for potential emolument violations. If the State Department began obstructing requests from foreign governments to lease units in Trump-affiliated properties, he said, it could prompt them to retaliate against U.S. diplomats seeking housing in their territories. “The State Department’s interest in saying ‘no’ is probably zero if there’s no security threat and we have good reciprocal relations with the countries,” Kennedy told Reuters. According to the State Department records obtained by Reuters, which covered the period from January 2015 through September 2017, Trump World Tower was the only Trump-affiliated building in the United States where foreign governments sought to lease or buy units.  In 2017, the median monthly asking rent for units in Trump World Tower was $8,500, according to real estate website StreetEasy. That was more than 2.5 times the median in the surrounding neighborhood, known as Turtle Bay. Some of the foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, had previously purchased property in the building, where the average unit currently sells for nearly $7 million, according to StreetEasy. Mohammad Alkadi, a spokesman for the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, said Trump World Tower’s prime location near U.N. headquarters was the kingdom’s motivation to lease there. “The governments pay for these units in the building not to get favors from Trump or anything, but just because it’s very convenient and comfortable for us,” Alkadi said. He said he moved into his own unit in Trump World Tower at the end of 2017. Slovakia, another Trump World Tower renter, said in a statement that its lease was “fully in line with U.S. legislation and our internal guidelines.” Slovakia’s prime minister is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House today to discuss security cooperation and other issues. The Malaysian mission to the United Nations said it was not currently renting a unit in Trump World Tower when reached by phone in April. It declined to comment on the unit it rented in 2017. That lease was confirmed to Reuters by a person familiar with the transaction. All the other governments that sought to rent units after Trump’s inauguration declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

40,"RPT-INSIGHT-As IPO looms, Uber clings to hard-knuckled tactics in pursuit of growth - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  12:02 PM / in 3 hours","8 Min Read(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Heather Somerville and Joe Bavier SAN FRANCISCO/ CAPE TOWN, May 7 (Reuters) - Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick used to tell investors he liked to keep his company teetering between order and chaos. By the time he left, it was chaos. The company was battered by a slew of scandals, including revelations it had used illicit tactics to handicap competitors and dodge regulators. Almost two years later, under new leadership and set to debut Friday on Wall Street in the largest U.S. public stock offering since 2014, Uber Technologies Inc is still testing the rule of law. With growth slowing, the company continues to spar with local officials around the world looking to limit Uber cars on their streets. In Cape Town, South Africa, for example, Uber dominates the market with an estimated 7,000 drivers, most of whom are operating illegally, according to city officials. Uber blames Cape Town’s “broken” system for approving ride-hailing licenses. In the United States, Uber has used the courts to try to block what it see as unreasonable restrictions on its business. And it has successfully lobbied state legislatures to pass laws preempting local ride-hailing regulations, much to the frustration of officials in some cities where it operates. Uber insiders say CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made strides in cleaning up a frat-house culture that spawned allegations of sexual harassment and embarrassing leaks of executives behaving badly. But Uber’s sharp-elbowed business tactics, detailed by lawmakers, city staff and regulators across the globe, as well as drivers and former employees, continue to drive the company. “It’s in the DNA,” a former Uber manager said. “Old habits die hard.” Whether its playbook delivers the growth and profitability public market investors will be seeking remains to be seen. Revenue growth slowed to 2.3% in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter, a worrisome sign for a business that lost more than $3 billion last year. Uber’s economics “are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,” Mark Hargraves, Head of Framlington Global Equities at AXA Investment Managers, said in a recent note to clients. An Uber spokesman declined to comment. In its IPO filing, the company said it is “using a proactive and collaborative approach with regulators” and “rebuilding and strengthening” its relationships with cities. Where ride-hailing is banned, Uber is instead offering e-bike services or partnering with traditional taxi companies. Still the company acknowledged “legal and regulatory obstacles” around the world that could impede its revenue and growth. Thousands of miles from Wall Street, Uber is pushing the bounds of regulation. In Chile, which has yet to work out a regulatory framework for ridesharing, Uber drivers have been known to enlist passengers to help them evade transit cops. In Mexico City, Uber has protested new safety rules it says would limit the number of riders who could use the app. In London, Uber is on probation after it was temporarily banned for flouting safety rules. And in Cape Town, Uber has entered its fifth year of a stalemate with local officials. Every ride-hailing service in Cape Town is allotted a certain number of operating licenses for its drivers. As of mid-April, Western Cape Province, where the city is located, had approved 760 such licenses for Uber. But the city estimates there are roughly 10 times that many Uber drivers plying its streets, many of them immigrants or refugees. Foreign-born drivers must also have work permits, paperwork many of them lack, according to city aldermen and drivers. Uber said it allows drivers to start work while their ride-hailing licenses are still pending approval but that the company thoroughly vets the drivers. A game of cat and mouse has ensued: drivers alert each other to the whereabouts of traffic cops through the WhatsApp mobile messaging service. If their cars are impounded, they pay the fines, start driving anew and wait for Uber to reimburse them. Those impound fines start at almost $500 and go up with each subsequent offense, topping out at more than $1,000. Drivers are fined an additional $173 each time. “It’s just like gangsterism fighting for turf,” said Ivan, a South African driver who gave only his first name. Uber has spent at least $2.3 million since 2016 to reimburse drivers for the impound fines, according to Reuters’ estimate based on data from the city. Uber declined to say how much it had spent, but said it would continue paying the fines to support its drivers and get them back on the road. South Africa is crucial to Uber’s Africa strategy, boasting the continent’s most-developed economy. A spokesperson for Uber South Africa said Cape Town’s licensing system “is effectively broken” and blamed the city for what it says is a backlog that can stretch for more than two years in some cases. The city estimates there is a market for about 2,100 Uber drivers. Alderman JP Smith said part of Cape Town’s calculus is to head off violence that could result if too many taxi drivers are put out of business by new ride-hailing rivals. In the larger cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg, some Uber drivers and cabbies have been killed and their cars torched as part of an ongoing turf war. “In other parts of the world, if there are too many taxis some just stop being taxis,” Smith said. “Here, disputes between taxis are settled via assassination and murder.” The face-off may not find a resolution any time soon. Cape Town is expanding its impound facilities so it can take in nearly twice the number of cars. Big cities concerned about gridlock, air quality and the safety of passengers and drivers are crafting new policies and demanding more data from ride-hailing companies to find solutions. Uber is pushing back. The company sued New York City in February over a law imposing a cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers, a move taken to address worsening traffic. In its hometown of San Francisco, Uber is fighting a court order to turn over data the city says would help improve traffic management and the safety of Uber drivers. As city officials in the United States have gotten scrappier, Uber has sought out friendlier state legislators to work around them. Over just four years, Uber and rival Lyft helped pass laws in 41 states that put ride-hailing under the state’s jurisdiction, preempting some or all local regulations, according to a 2018 study by the National Employment Law Project. Uber is now pushing legislation in Oregon that would preempt local mandates on driver caps, permits, data collection and access for passengers in wheelchairs, among others. Uber’s general manager for Oregon said the bill would create “increased mobility for rural and urban communities,” by bringing Uber to towns that currently do not allow it. Officials in Portland say their city is in the crosshairs. After Uber launched there in late 2014, Portland sued to stop its operation, declaring it illegal. That suit was later dropped, but Portland regulates Uber closely. Noah Siegel, interim assistant director at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said the proposed legislation would hurt the city’s ability to manage growth and ensure everyone can get around safely. “We were not really holding a lot of bad blood about what had happened” with Uber in the past, Siegel said. “But this bill serves as a reference point that it’s only been four years and they still haven’t turned a profit and they will do anything to make money.” Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco and Joe

44,"Italy's debt set to climb as economy stalls, employment drops- EU - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  11:52 AM / Updated 3 hours ago","4 Min Read* Worsening estimates could reignite dispute with EU over budget * Italy to grow by 0.1 pct this year, lowest rate in the bloc * Debt, deficit to raise far beyond EU fiscal ceilings By Francesco Guarascio BRUSSELS, May 7 (Reuters) - Italy’s huge debt is expected to grow further this year and next as the country’s growth remains sluggish, the European Commission said on Tuesday in quarterly economic forecasts that could reignite a dispute over Rome’s budget. Brussels cut its already gloomy outlook of Italy’s economy, which it now says is set to grow by 0.1 percent this year instead of the 0.2 percent it predicted in February. The country grew by 0.9 percent last year. The downward revision confirms the general worsening trend for the wider euro zone economy, which is expected to slow more than previously estimated. But Italy remains the country with the lowest growth in the bloc, far below the euro zone’s 1.2 percent expansion forecast for this year. The Commission said Italy’s sluggish growth will weigh on the country’s public finances, with both debt and deficit expected to climb far beyond what is allowed by EU fiscal rules. Although no EU decision over possible disciplinary moves is expected before European elections on May 23-26, the new estimates could increase market pressure on the Italian government, which is already plagued by infighting. With no policy changes by the eurosceptic Italian administration, Italy’s debt would grow to 133.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, and peak at 135.2 percent in 2020, the EU executive estimated. Euro zone countries with a debt above 60 percent of GDP are required to gradually reduce it, but Italy’s debt has been growing since last year. With a debt ratio second only to bailed-out Greece, Rome has already the highest interest expenditure in the bloc with 3.7 percent of its output paid to service debt last year. As yields dropped slightly after a deal with Brussels over the Italian budget in December, interest expenditure is forecast to drop to 3.6 percent of GDP this year, before rising again in 2020. With no changes in the government’s spending policies, the country’s deficit is also set to grow to 2.5 percent of output this year and to climb to 3.5 percent in 2020, beyond the 3.0 percent ceiling set by EU fiscal rules. The structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and the effects of the business cycle, is also expected to significantly worsen. This indicator is crucial in the EU assessment over countries’ compliance with fiscal rules. MORE JOBLESS Despite worsening public finances, caused by lower growth and higher welfare spending, employment is expected to fall, the Commission predicted, in a blow to the Italian administration’s flagship policies aimed at reducing joblessness. Employment is set to drop by 0.1 percent this year, while the unemployment rate will climb to 10.9 percent this year and to 11.0 percent in 2020, as government jobless subsidies are “likely to induce more people to officially register as unemployed,” the Commission said. The Commission also said investments would fall by 0.3 percent this year, after a 3.4 percent increase in 2018. Italy’s primary surplus, which excludes interest payments, is expected to ease. Italy’s outlook could worsen if yields rose again, but would improve if spending was reduced and a planned rise of sales tax was applied next year, the Commission said.

45,"Euro zone economy to rebound next year, but inflation won't accelerate: EU Commission - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  11:59 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago","3 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy will rebound next year from a slow-down in 2019 and unemployment will fall further, but inflation is likely to stay at this year’s levels and below the European Central Bank’s target, the European Commission said on Tuesday. The European Union’s executive arm said in a quarterly economic forecast for the EU’s 28 countries that euro zone gross domestic product would grow 1.2 percent this year, slower than 1.3 percent seen in February, and well below the 1.9 percent growth in 2018. But it will rebound to 1.5 percent in 2020. Unemployment in 19 countries sharing the euro is to fall to 7.3 percent next year from 7.7 percent expected this year. “In 2020, adverse domestic factors are expected to fade and economic activity outside the EU to rebound, supported by easing global financial conditions and policy stimulus in some emerging economies,” the Commission said. Euro zone inflation is to stay below the ECB’s target of below, but close to 2 percent, as despite the faster growth next year, prices would grow only 1.4 percent, the same as this year. The ECB expects euro zone inflation at 1.2 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2020 and has already announced plans to provide even more stimulus through a new round of ultra cheap loans to banks to help the economy. As a result of the slowdown this year, the aggregated budget deficit of the euro zone will rise to 0.9 percent of GDP from 0.5 percent last year, and stay at 0.9 percent in 2020. Those with budget surpluses like Germany and the Netherlands will cut them, the Commission forecast, but those with deficits already close to the EU ceiling of 3 percent like France and Italy, are likely to break that limit this year or next, setting themselves up for a clash with the EU executive.  Aggregated euro zone debt is to fall to 85.8 percent of GDP this year from 87.1 percent last year, and decline further to 84.3 percent in 2020, with Germany moving below the EU ceiling of 60 percent of GDP this year for the first time since 2002. The debt of the most highly indebted Greece, which last year emerged from its third euro zone bailout, is to fall to 174.9 percent of GDP this year from 181.1 percent last year and to 168.9 percent in 2020. French debt is likely to rise this year and ease marginally in 2020, while Italy, unless it changes policies, will go against the European trend and see its already second largest public debt rise to 135.2 percent of GDP next year.  But the Commission also said there were “pronounced” risks to these forecasts. “On the external side, these include further escalation of trade conflicts and weakness in emerging markets, in particular China. In Europe, we should stay alert to a possible ‘no-deal Brexit’, political uncertainty and a possible return of the sovereign-bank loop,” Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.

50,"Baltimore mayor quits amid questions over $500,000 book deal - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  7:51 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, whose home and offices were raided by federal agents last week as part of an investigation into her financial dealings, abruptly resigned on Thursday.  Pugh, a Democrat and former state lawmaker, apologized for harming the city’s image in a statement read by her lawyer.  “I am confident that I have left the city in capable hands for the duration of the term to which I was elected,” Pugh, 69, said in her resignation letter. City Council President Bernard “Jack” Young becomes acting mayor. Pugh’s statement and formal resignation letter were read by attorney Steve Silverman at a news conference outside his Baltimore office. Pugh, who has rarely been seen in public since taking medical leave on April 1, did not attend.  Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service searched Pugh’s home and offices on April 25 following a string of investigative stories in the Baltimore Sun newspaper beginning in mid-March about her financial dealings.  The newspaper reported that Pugh had been paid at least $500,000 by the University of Maryland Medical System, where she sat on the board, for her self-published children’s books about a character named “Healthy Holly.” Pugh, who initially defended the book deal, called the arrangement a “regrettable mistake” at a March 28 press conference. She announced her leave two days later, saying she was suffering from pneumonia. “This was the right decision, as it was clear the mayor could no longer lead effectively. The federal and state investigations must and will continue to uncover the facts,” Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said on Twitter. Young, who has served as acting mayor during Pugh’s month-long absence, said in a separate statement that he learned only on Thursday afternoon that she was stepping down. “I believe this action is in the best interest of Baltimore,” Young said. Although I understand that this ordeal has caused real pain for many Baltimoreans, I promise that we will emerge from it more committed than ever to building a stronger Baltimore.” Pugh was elected to a four-year term as mayor in 2016 after gaining prominence as a state lawmaker during protests over the 2015 death in police custody of a 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray. Following the law enforcement raids, 14 of the 15 Baltimore City Council members urged Pugh to resign. Young did not sign the letter. Hogan, a Republican, also called for her to quit.

51,"Explainer: How powerful are Congress subpoenas, contempt citations? - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  2:47 PM / 5 days ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. House Democrats threatened on Thursday to hold Attorney General William Barr in “contempt of Congress” for not complying with a subpoena to hand over an unredacted version of the Mueller report. What does that mean? Congress does not arrest and detain people for ignoring its subpoenas anymore, but it still has significant power to demand witnesses and documents, though it could take time. The contempt citation is a key part of that congressional clout. President Donald Trump, with Barr’s assistance, is stonewalling several inquiries being led by Democrats in the House of Representatives into his administration, his family and his personal business interests. The confrontation between the White House and Congress escalated on Thursday when Barr refused to appear for a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The report focused on Russian interference in favor of Trump in the 2016 U.S. election and subsequent attempts by Trump to impede Mueller’s investigation. Here is how the congressional subpoena, contempt and enforcement process works. What is a subpoena? A subpoena is a legally enforceable demand for documents, data, or witness testimony. Subpoenas are typically used by litigants in court cases. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress’s power to issue subpoenas, saying in order to write laws it also needs to be able to investigate. Congress’ power to issue subpoenas, while broad, is not unlimited. The high court has said Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and cannot investigate someone purely to expose wrongdoing or damaging information about them for political gain. A subpoena must potentially further some “legitimate legislative purpose,” the court has said. What can Congress do to a government official who ignores one?  If lawmakers want to punish someone who ignores a congressional subpoena they typically first hold the offender “in contempt of Congress,” legal experts said. The contempt process can start in either the House or the Senate. Unlike with legislation, it only takes one of the chambers to make and enforce a contempt citation.   Typically, the members of the congressional committee that issued the subpoena will vote on whether to move forward with a contempt finding. If a majority supports the resolution, then another vote will be held by the entire chamber. The Democrats have majority control of the House; Trump’s Republican Party holds the Senate. Only a majority of the 435-member House needs to support a contempt finding for one to be reached. After a contempt vote, Congress has powers to enforce a subpoena. How is a contempt finding enforced? The Supreme Court said in 1821 that Congress has “inherent authority” to arrest and detain recalcitrant witnesses.  In 1927, the high court said the Senate acted lawfully in sending its deputy sergeant-at-arms to Ohio to arrest and detain the brother of the then-attorney general, who had refused to testify about a bribery scheme known as the Teapot Dome scandal.   It has been almost a century since Congress exercised this arrest-and-detain authority, and the practice is unlikely to make a comeback, legal experts said. Alternatively, Congress can ask the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a federal prosecutor, to bring criminal charges against a witness who refuses to appear. There is a criminal law that specifically prohibits flouting a congressional subpoena. But this option is also unlikely to be pursued, at least when it comes to subpoenas against executive branch officials, given that federal prosecutors are part of the branch’s Justice Department.  “It would be odd, structurally, because it would mean the Trump administration would be acting to enforce subpoenas against the Trump administration,” said Lisa Kern Griffin, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Duke University.  For this reason, in modern times Congress has opted for a third and final approach to enforcing a contempt finding: getting its lawyers to bring a civil lawsuit asking a judge to rule that compliance is required.  Failure to comply with such an order can trigger a “contempt of court” finding, enforced through daily fines and even imprisonment, Griffin said.

52,Rights groups sue over U.S. decision to hold asylum seekers without bond - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:39 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Immigrant rights groups asked a U.S. court on Thursday to reverse a Trump administration decision that allows asylum seekers who cross the border illegally to be held without bond. The groups, which include the American Civil Liberties Union, say an April 16 decision by U.S. Attorney General William Barr violates the asylum seekers’ rights under U.S. law and puts thousands of people at risk of being detained for months or years while they wait for their cases to work their way through a backlogged immigration court system.   “This is about the Trump administration’s agenda of locking up any asylum seeker they can to deter people from seeking protection under our laws,” said Michael Tan, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU filed the challenge with the American Immigration Council and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “The administration cannot bypass the Constitution by arbitrarily locking people up.” The Department of Justice declined to comment. The court challenge came in the form of an amended complaint to an existing lawsuit. Earlier in April, U.S. federal judge Marsha Pechman had ordered the U.S. government to provide faster bond hearings to asylum seekers who pass their initial screenings. Before that ruling could go into effect, the Attorney General reversed an immigration court precedent that had allowed asylum seekers who entered the country illegally to ask an immigration judge to release them on bond. Barr delayed the implementation of his decision by 90 days, and the rights groups are suing to stop it from going into effect. Without the possibility of a bond hearing before an immigration judge, asylum seekers would be reliant on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) granting them parole. An average of 46,756 immigrants have been held in ICE detention each day of fiscal year 2019, an ICE representative said on Thursday. Barr’s ruling applies only to adult asylum seekers without children, as families cannot be detained for longer than 20 days.

53,Failure of Deutsche Bank-Commerzbank merger talks no surprise: watchdog - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  9:28 AM / Updated 4 hours ago","2 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The failure of merger talks between Deutsche Bank  and Commerzbank  was “not a surprise”, a German official said on Tuesday. The statement by Raimund Roeseler, an executive with Germany’s financial markets watchdog, marked the regulator’s first public comments on the failed merger talks, which were discontinued last month after six weeks of negotiations. The banks attributed the failure to risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. The banks will still be under pressure to cut costs, Bafin president Felix Hufeld said. He dismissed the notion that hurdles stood in the way to cross-boarder banking mergers in Europe. The comments, made at an annual news conference, came as Bafin disclosed that it was looking into a possible erosion of bank lending standards in Germany and has also created a new department to deal with especially troubled banks. Bafin and the Bundesbank in April started a survey of nearly 100 financial institutions, according to Roeseler. “A possible erosion of lending standards in conjunction with reduced risk provisioning can lead to a threat to financial stability,” Roeseler said. “We are therefore taking a closer look at this.” The survey is still being conducted and Bafin said it would provide results when they were available. Bafin founded the new department - a so-called intensive care station - at the beginning of this year. Bafin decided to take this step while the economy was good “in order to be prepared when there really is a need for a downturn”, he said. Roeseler added that there were banks on the intensive care station but he would not provide further details except to say it was a single-digit figure.

The High Election Board ruled on Monday for a fresh Istanbul mayoral contest on June 23, scrapping the March 31 vote which was lost by Erdogan’s party candidate, in a move that drew opposition accusations of dictatorship. “We see this as an important step to strengthen our democracy,” Erdogan told lawmakers from his AK Party in parliament. “We believe there was organized corruption and full illegality in the Istanbul mayoral elections.” The Turkish lira tumbled against the dollar after the election decision, bringing its losses this year to 14 percent as investors fretted about political uncertainty and business leaders criticized the move. Erdogan said Turkey was facing economic sabotage and vowed to fend off attacks on the economy. “So, what are we going to do? From now on, we will do what we did to terrorists.” Turkey’s Western allies have also expressed concern about the election’s annulment.

56,UPDATE 1-China's April forex reserves drop for first time in 6 months - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  9:37 AM / Updated 5 hours ago","4 Min Read* April reserves fall $3.81 bln vs forecast of $1.24 bln rise * Firmer dollar, changes in asset prices behind April drop * Sudden jump in U.S.-China trade tensions puts yuan under renewed pressure * Fresh trade uncertainty comes amid signs that China economy may be steadying (Adds regulator comment, details) BEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell for the first time in six months in April, despite recent data that suggested the world’s second-largest economy is starting to steady in response to stimulus measures. The decline in China’s reserves, the world’s largest, was modest, however, falling $3.81 billion last month to $3.095 trillion, central bank data showed on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would rise $1.24 billion to $3.1 trillion. The small drop in April was due to a firmer U.S. dollar and changes in prices of global assets that China holds, the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement. Cross-border capital flows will be basically stable in future, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said. China’s foreign exchange reserves climbed by $22.24 billion in the first four months of this year, after dropping $67.24 billion in 2018. For much of last year, global investors worried about the risk of capital flight as the Chinese economy cooled, and debated how much Beijing would allow the yuan currency to weaken, though strict capital controls kept outflows in check. Unexpectedly strong March data had suggested the economy was slowly getting back on steadier footing, but a sudden escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions this week has put the yuan back under pressure and revived concerns over Chinese growth. China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios for some small and medium-sized banks, in a targeted move to help small firms struggling amid the economic slowdown. In April, the yuan fell 0.3 percent against the dollar, while the dollar inched up 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies . The yuan fell 5.3 percent against the dollar last year as trade relations with the United States deteriorated and the Chinese economy slowed. Despite sharp losses on Monday following fresh U.S. tariff threats, the yuan is still up 1.6 percent against the dollar so far this year. More structural issues are also starting to come into play for the currency. China’s current account is slowly swinging from a decades’ long surplus towards a deficit, signalling a major shift in capital flows into and out of the country which could make the yuan exchange rate more volatile. The OECD said last month that China’s current account may swing to a deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP this year from a small surplus in 2018, amid its rebalancing towards domestic demand. With the economy increasingly reliant on domestic consumption rather than exports, China is no longer amassing dollars at a rapid rate. The value of China’s gold reserves fell to $78.35 billion from $78.525 billion at end March. But they continued to grow in size, rising to 61.1 million fine troy ounces from 60.620 million ounces in March.

The 2030 issue tumbled more than 1 cent in the dollar to their lowest level in a month, according to Tradeweb data. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said on Monday Lebanon was far from bankruptcy but warned that failure to pass a “realistic” budget to bring down the state deficit would be tantamount to a “suicide operation” against the economy. Central bank workers walked out on Monday over the budget proposals that would cut their benefits though decided to suspend their strike on Tuesday.

61,FOREX-Aussie surges after central bank holds rates; yuan stabilises - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  9:17 AM / Updated 5 hours ago","4 Min Read* Aussie rallies as central bank dashes rate cut hopes * Despite Trump tariffs threat, FX markets broadly quiet * Yen pauses after brief rise to five-week high on Monday * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds details, updates with latest prices) By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar surged on Tuesday after the country’s central bank held interest rates at a record low, while currency markets stabilised following U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat of additional tariffs on Chinese goods. Foreign exchange markets were mostly quiet, with investors far from panicking about the prospect of a breakdown in negotiations between China and the United States to resolve their trade dispute. The Aussie rallied as much as 0.8 percent to $0.7048 , after the Reserve Bank of Australia held rates, dashing speculation it may ease policy following a weaker-than-expected reading of inflation. Central banks across the globe have turned increasingly dovish in 2019, raising expectations that policymakers would ease monetary conditions. “Today’s position from the RBA marks a correction to the recent trend in G10 FX, where expectations of policy normalisation have been scaled back and fresh easing (particularly in Australia and New Zealand) has been priced in,” ING analysts said. Australia’s central bank, however, opened the door wider for future cuts should the jobs market not improve. Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week and would “soon” target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs. But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he expected the top Chinese negotiator Vice Premier Liu to lead a delegation from Beijing for talks in Washington this week, and some investors interpreted Trump’s threat as a negotiating tactic. “As long as the talks continue, the market will remain relaxed...that there will be a deal after all,” said Esther Reichelt, a curency analyst at Commerzbank, while adding that this week’s developments forced the market to reprice its expectations. “The market was very optimistic, maybe a bit too optimistic,” she said. The offshore yuan on Monday was on course for its worst daily drop in 10-months, briefly touching a four-month low of 6.8218 after Trump’s tariff threat, but it later erased most of those losses. China’s offshore exchange rate stood unchanged at 6.7741 yuan per dollar by 0845 GMT. The U.S. dollar was flat, with the index at 97.528. The safe-haven yen added 0.1 percent to 110.665 yen after briefly touching a five-week high on Monday. The euro slipped marginally to $1.1195. The Swedish crown rallied after central bank board members said that while inflation was weak it did not justify an overhaul of policy, according to minutes from the recent Riksbank meeting. The crown rose 0.3 percent to 10.6875 crowns per euro. Sterling reversed earlier gains to trade down 0.1 percent at $1.3124 after hopes that talks between the Conservative and Labour parties over Brexit can make headway had last week sent the pound to one-month highs.

62,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares steady after trade blow, Turkey's troubles mount - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  9:17 AM / Updated 5 hours ago","4 Min Read* Europe’s shares steady after heavy fall on Monday * Lighthizer: China reneged on commitments; E-Mini futures slip * U.S.-China talks to continue this week; Chinese VP due to attend * Nikkei falls as markets reopen after 10-day break * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Marc Jones LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - World markets steadied on Tuesday after being rattled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest threat to ramp up trade tariffs on China, though Turkey’s lira was back in trouble as concerns about its politics erupted again. It was a calmer start from Europe’s main bourses after Trump’s threat to ratchet up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods triggered the biggest sell-off in European equities since March. London dipped 0.2 percent as it had to play catch-up after a long weekend, but Frankfurt, Paris and the pan-European STOXX 600 index all flitted between gains and losses as more normal service resumed. Some investors are holding out hope that the tariff threats are a negotiating tactic, especially as Beijing confirmed its top negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, would go to Washington on Thursday and Friday as planned. MSCI’s broadest global and Asian indexes had largely held their ground overnight, though Japan’s Nikkei did take a delayed 1.5 percent hit, having been closed for over a week. Asia tumbled 2 percent on Monday and Chinese markets had suffered their worst drop in more than three years. “We expect the situation to de-escalate as the issue seems solvable and Liu He, China’s lead negotiator, is continuing with his plans to travel to Washington D.C. for talks this week,” said Oxford Economics economist Louis Kuijs. “Nonetheless, the probability of renewed escalation of the U.S.-China trade war has risen substantially, which would be a drag on their respective economies, especially on China.” China’s yuan had recouped most of its early losses against the dollar by the end of trading there as investors largely digested the situation. The offshore yuan clawed as high as 6.7628 per dollar at one point, trimming the intraday loss to 6 pips from the previous late night close of 6.7622. There was plenty more keeping traders busy too. Australia’s dollar jumped almost 1 percent to a one-week top of $0.7048, after the country’s central bank kept rates on hold, wrongfooting some who had expected it to cut. Other major currencies remained confined to well-trodden ranges, with the euro trading virtually flat at $1.1212 ahead of new European Commission economic forecasts and the dollar holding steady at 110.63 yen. In emerging markets though, the Turkish lira was back under heavy fire after the country’s elections board ruled to scrap and re-run Istanbul elections. It slid 1.5 percent past the 6.15 per dollar which also sent government bonds tumbling. “The rule of law is under scrutiny by markets,” UniCredit EM FX strategist Kiran Kowshik said. “It is also clear that Turkish reserves are depleted and there are questions about whether Turkey can weather its immediate challenges without an external anchor like the IMF.” In the commodity market, oil futures traded steady to higher on Tuesday as U.S. sanctions on crude exporters Iran and Venezuela kept supply concerns alive. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures inched up to $62.34 per barrel while Brent crude oil futures were little changed at $71.23.

63,Senate upholds veto of Yemen resolution in victory for Trump Saudi policy - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:11 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday sustained President Donald Trump’s veto of a resolution demanding an end to military support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, in a victory for the White House’s policy of continued backing for the kingdom. The vote was 53 to 45, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto, despite a handful of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats in backing the war powers resolution. It was only the second veto of Trump’s presidency, both this year. Neither has garnered the two-thirds support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives needed to override. The resolution’s passage earlier this year marked the first time both the Senate and House supported the provision of the War Powers Act limiting the president’s ability to send troops into action without congressional authorization. Backers of the resolution said they wanted to reassert Congress’ constitutional power to declare war, and send a strong message to Saudi Arabia about the devastating civilian toll of the four-year-long civil war in Yemen. “We’ve been materially assisting a foreign power in its efforts to bomb its adversaries. And sometimes helping that foreign power to bomb innocent civilians on the ground in the process,” Republican Senator Mike Lee, a co-sponsor of the resolution, said before the vote. The war in Yemen, which pits Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Houthi rebels backed by Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire humanitarian crisis, with the country on the brink of famine. Many members of Congress have also become increasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record, anger fueled by the murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkey last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for the Washington Post. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing. Resolution opponents argued that support for the Saudi-led coalition was not an appropriate use of the War Powers Act, because the military provides supports such as targeting assistance, not troops. “The premise of this resolution is fundamentally flawed and I believe a misrepresentation of what is happening on the ground in Yemen,” Republican Senator Jim Risch said before the vote. Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is writing legislation to address the situation with Saudi Arabia. He declined to discuss possible specific provisions of the measure, but said he hoped to introduce it in May with the goal of finding something that could pass both the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House and be signed, not vetoed, by Trump. Amid U.S. and international anger over the civilian toll of the Yemen conflict, the Trump administration last year stopped providing refueling support for Saudi aircraft in Yemen.

64,"White House letter blasts Mueller report, says Trump has right to instruct advisers not to testify - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  5:03 PM / 5 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has the right to instruct advisers not to testify before congressional oversight probes related to the Russia investigation, the White House said in a letter that blasts Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report as deeply flawed. The April 19 letter from White House legal counsel Emmet Flood to Attorney General William Barr, obtained by Reuters on Thursday, was in line with Trump’s confrontational approach to dealing with a Democratic effort to use the Mueller report as a springboard into more investigations. Flood said Trump’s decision to let advisers cooperate with the Mueller probe does not extend to congressional oversight investigations. Democrats have argued Trump waived the right to assert executive privilege by allowing advisers to cooperate extensively with Mueller.  The White House conclusion was an indication that Trump would, if necessary, declare executive privilege to prevent former lawyer Don McGahn and other advisers from testifying to Congress, which would likely trigger a court battle. “It is one thing for a president to encourage complete cooperation and transparency in a criminal investigation conducted largely within the Executive Branch. It is something else entirely to allow his advisers to appear before Congress...” the letter said. Tensions have flared between the White House and congressional Democrats since the Mueller report was released. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, threatened to hold Barr in contempt for resisting demands for Mueller’s full, unredacted report, and accused Trump of “a growing attack” on democracy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, accused Barr of committing a crime, saying he lied to lawmakers about his interactions with Mueller. The White House letter was transmitted to Barr a day after the release of the Mueller report, in which the special counsel determined that Trump did not collude with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but pointedly did not say whether the president committed obstruction of justice. Flood’s letter said the Mueller report itself suffers from “an extraordinary legal defect.” According to relevant law, the letter said, Mueller should have rendered a judgment on whether to prosecute or not to prosecute. Instead, Mueller produced “a prosecutorial curiosity - part ‘truth commission’ report and part law school exam paper,” the letter said. “What prosecutors are supposed to do is complete an investigation and then either ask the grand jury to return an indictment or decline to charge the case,” Flood wrote in his the five-page letter to Barr. “The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” he said.  Flood’s letter addressed whether Mueller had given Congress a “roadmap” for its own inquiry with his report. If that is the case, the letter said, “it too serves as additional evidence of the SCO’s (Special Counsel’s Office) refusal to follow applicable law.” The letter also provided a potential justification for a probe that Trump wants into those who began investigating his possible ties to Russia in 2016, when he was still a candidate. Of concern in particular were leaks about conversations that former Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn had with Sergey Kislyak, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, in 2016. “Government officials, with access to classified information derived from a counterintelligence investigation and from classified intelligence intercepts, engaged in a campaign of illegal leaks against the president,” the letter said.

65,House backs Paris agreement in first climate bill in a decade - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:48 PM / in 5 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed its first climate-change bill in a decade, voting 231-190 to require that Trump administration keep the United States as a party to the Paris Climate Agreement. The Climate Action Now Act would require President Donald Trump to develop a plan for the United States to meet the goals it committed to in the Paris agreement to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and block federal funds from being used to advance the formal U.S. withdrawal from the pact.  Trump has stood by his 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the 2015 climate accord and has been dismissive of regulations aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions. The bill, which passed along party lines, as expected, with three Republicans backing the measure, was meant to signal to the international community that many Americans support the Paris agreement regardless of Trump’s decision to abandon it. “Today we sent a message to the president, to the American people and to the world that we recognize the seriousness of the climate crisis, and that we intend to do our part to address it. Today we sent the message: We are still in,” said Representative Frank Pallone, chairman of the House energy committee. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would not take up the legislation, dismissing the bill as “political theater” by Democrats. Democrats have put climate change back on the agenda in Congress after re-gaining the majority in the House earlier this year, holding dozens of hearings on the issue. Many of the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election have made climate change a top-tier issue of their campaigns. All have backed re-entering the United States into the Paris Climate Agreement. A few candidates, including most recently former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke, have also supported setting a goal for the United States to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 - one of the goals of the Paris agreement.

66,European shares flat as deal boost fails to offset trade worries - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  8:14 AM / Updated 3 hours ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares flitted between slight gains and losses amid a flurry of deal making and earnings as investors cautiously tracked developments around U.S.-China trade talks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat by 0850 GMT. London’s FTSE 100 underperformed as investors returned from a long weekend. Milan’s FTMIB and Madrid’s IBEX 35 index were up more than 0.3 percent, helped by dealmaking activities. Italy’s biggest bank UniCredit said it was considering a sale of its FinecoBank unit and had adopted measures to ensure the online broker could operate outside the group. “The timing is a little surprising and may reignite concerns that UniCredit are still facing upwards pressure of capital requirements, however this decision does seem more strategic than forced,” said Russell Quelch, financials analyst at Redburn. “As an independent entity we suspect Fineco could in time become a target for others who want to establish a presence in the Italian AM industry.” Across the region, banks fell 0.7 percent, the biggest sectoral decline. Spain’s Cellnex said it had the go-ahead to buy Iliad’s mobile tower assets in France and Italy for 2 billion euros ($2.24 billion). Both Cellenex and Illiad were among top performers on the STOXX 600.     Germany’s biggest residential property company Vonovia pushed the real estate sector up more than 1.5 percent after it raised its full-year profit guidance. France’s Alstom rose after the transport infrastructure group posted a stronger annual profit, boosted by orders and contracts. Among decliners, Henkel slid more than 4 percent after the German consumer goods company reported a disappointing quarter of earnings as its adhesives business was hit by falling industrial production and its beauty unit underperformed in western Europe and China. G4S shares lost 2 percent after Garda World Security Corp dropped interest in its cash solutions business. Tariff-exposed auto sector fell for the second session. BMW led losses after reporting a 78 percent fall in quarterly operating profit, as it took a hit from higher investment spending and a legal provision. Equity markets around the world were hit on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by Friday. China still said that Vice Premier Liu He will visit the U.S. on May 9 and 10 for trade talks. As trade headlines deepen global growth worries, latest data showed German industrial orders rose less than expected in March.

68,S&P Dow Jones Indices aims for world dairy index by year-end: company official - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  9:23 AM / in 5 hours","2 Min ReadSINGAPORE (Reuters) - S&P Dow Jones Indices is planning to launch an index for the global dairy industry by end of this year, a senior company official told Reuters on Tuesday. Demand for dairy products in Asia, led by China, has been climbing rapidly in recent years as people with higher incomes turn to protein-rich foods. “We are trying to do an index in the dairy space, skimmed milk powder to start with,” said Fiona Boal, head of Commodities and Real Assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “We are doing that at the request of the industry, ... reason being is that they felt they are left out of financialization of commodity markets.” She said the planned index will take into account markets in the United States, Europe and New Zealand.  “(We plan to launch it) maybe by end of this year. There are some challenges around creating a global index, for how we weigh the index,” she told Reuters, adding that the index would likely be trade-weighted rather than production weighted. “You want the index to be useful to farmers and investors.” Last week, New Zealand dairy group Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd said that local milk production in March dropped 8 percent year-on-year, but exports rose as Asian demand remained robust. Exports from New Zealand surged 27 percent in February, the world’s largest dairy company said in a statement, with shipments to China increasing 11 percent over the month. Boal said the dairy industry was keen on adding liquidity. “It is an interesting example where the industry thinks that by adding additional liquidity... is highly valuable.” Reporting by Naveen Thukral; editing by Christian SchmollingerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

69,Take Five: Vol squall coming? World markets themes for the week ahead - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:58 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. With cross-asset volatility  at record lows, it’s a great backdrop for investors to load up on risk. Reams have been written on the reasons for falling volatility, but logic attributes it first to major central banks’ recent tilt back into dovishness, and second to the global economy’s tepid but steady expansion with few inflation surprises.  So low is cross-asset vol that a gauge compiled by brokerage INTL FcStone stands 3.6 standard deviations below the mean. In other words, it deems that a vol surge has less than a 0.02 percent probability of occurring. And with that has come willingness to go short safe assets such as gold or Treasuries, and on protective hedges such as the VIX. (The latter is a measure of how much S&P500 options are expected to fluctuate, essentially a vol gauge). Outstanding shorts on VIX futures have reached record highs, CFTC data shows, surpassing the build-up seen before last February’s “Volmageddon” blowup. Unsurprisingly, some market watchers advise caution. As Volmageddon showed, vol can spike spectacularly in a quiet market, sometimes driven by just one unexpected data point. After all, if the old adage holds, some people may be looking to sell in May and go away. Graphic: VIX futures - tmsnrt.rs/2LiRsW2 Data: more important than usual these days as markets try to decide whether the green shoots cropping up in some places are the real deal.  Take the euro zone. Growth was faster than expected in the first quarter, after slumping in the second half of 2018. U.S. and Chinese first-quarter GDP surpassed expectations, too, while the Bank of England has just raised growth forecasts for 2019. So will upcoming data — U.S. and Chinese trade numbers — surprise to the upside as well? Germany releases industrial orders figures on Tuesday, and Friday brings a raft of British data, including first-quarter GDP. For sure, one week of brighter data isn’t enough to shift entrenched pessimism. So while Citi’s economic surprise indexes for Europe and United States have started ticking higher, they remain in negative territory. Nor have brighter growth numbers managed to lift German 10-year bond yields much above zero percent yet. But keep watching that data. Graphic: Green shoots of false start for Europe's economy - tmsnrt.rs/2VK8UGG This month’s Fed meeting saw Chairman Jerome Powell play down recent weakness in U.S. inflation as “transitory” and declare the policy stance “appropriate”.  His failure to give any hints that the central bank was weighing interest-rate cuts disappointed the S&P500 and pushed money markets to slash rate-cut bets for this year to around 40 percent from over 60 percent. It will also have earned Powell the ire of President Donald Trump, who has slammed the Fed boss for not doing more to support the economy. So is Powell right in his view of inflation? Some recent indicators, from first-quarter growth to factory orders to productivity, have been pretty strong. The flip side is manufacturing is growing more slowly and inventories are building. So we’ll need to see whether consumer and producer inflation figures due May 9 and 10 confirm the inflation backdrop is indeed transient. Graphic: ""Transitory"" weakness - tmsnrt.rs/2WkULNe Forecast-smashing results from Facebook, Amazon and Apple have laid to rest any short-term worries about the so-called FAANG group of tech titans. Google and Netflix, the other members of the cohort, were less sweet but not disastrous. Hopes now are that Asian Big Tech will confirm the comeback signals — mid-May is when China’s Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent update us on their earnings.     For MSCI’s global tech index .dMIWO0IT00PUS, net earnings revisions are at their strongest in over six months. With 60 percent of IT companies having reported so far, almost 90 percent have beaten expectations, according to UBS. Coming after a string of downgrades before March, that’s a relief. However, global tech earnings growth is expected to slow, compared with 2018. But after two years of double-digit growth, a pullback may represent a return to normal rather than a worrying drop. It’s more than likely that growth-hungry investors will return to backing big tech.  Graphic: Tech comeback - tmsnrt.rs/2Wj4wMb Markets were waiting to see who would cut interest rates first – Adrian Orr or Philip Lowe? The Reserve Bank of Australia, run by Lowe, has decided not to. So now it’s a question of what the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, headed by Orr, does on May 8. Both have the same story to tell – low inflation, strong labor markets and limited room to cut interest rates. Both economies have strong links with China, where growth is slowing. Lowe’s decision to hold rates provided a boost to the Aussie dollar though he left the door open to rate cuts. Possibly the decision was also complicated by upcoming elections but analysts polled by Reuters broadly expect two rate cuts this year. For Orr, the complication is that the new monetary policy  committee now includes external members. The recent rise in the Aussie-Kiwi exchange rate has suggested there’s a greater chance of a cut in New Zealand. But with the RBA on hold, the RBNZ might opt to do the same.   What’s not in doubt is that Asia is in policy easing mode -  Malaysia on Tuesday moved to support its economy with a 25 basis-point rate cut. Others are likely to follow.

71,Brewer AB InBev could float Asia business in Hong Kong - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  5:47 AM / in 3 hours","4 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer, is considering listing a minority stake in its Asian operations to create a separate business that could lead consolidation of brewing in the region. The announcement on Tuesday, released at the same time as first-quarter results, follows reports that the company had enlisted banks to work on a partial sale of the Asia-Pacific business. The brewer is saddled with more than $100 billion in debt after its 2016 purchase of nearest rival SABMiller and ultimately wants to bring its net debt to core profit (EBITDA) ratio down to 2 from 4.6 at the end of 2018. The Belgium-based company, whose beers include Stella Artois,  acknowledged that a minority stake listing would accelerate this process, but said its commitment to reduce the multiple to below 4 by the end of 2020 was not dependent on it.  The company said the main merit of a Hong Kong listing would be to create a champion in the Asia-Pacific, where sales are still growing and increasingly wealthy consumers are trading up to higher margin premium beers, such as its Budweiser or Corona. AB InBev chief financial officer Felipe Dutra told Reuters that a parallel could be drawn with Brazilian subsidiary AmBev, of which AB InBev owns 61.9 percent. It is now present in 16 countries in the Americas, including Argentina and Canada. Analysts at Jefferies said that $40-50 billion would be a reasonable valuation for the Asia-Pacific business, meaning that the company might be able to reduce debt by up to $20 billion.  The company’s Asian business would be unrivalled among listed consumer packaged goods companies in the region in terms of cross-country exposure and scale, Dutra said. AB InBev’s Asia-Pacific region, whose main markets are China and Australia, last year made up 18 percent of group volume and 14 percent of underlying operating profit. Its revenues were $8.47 billion. “Not only is it an attractive region from an investor standpoint, but is a kind of exposure that some existing shareholders of existing operations in the region might be willing to be part of,” he said. Dutra declined to say if AB InBev had talked to other regional brewers. Potential partners might include ThaiBev or San Miguel of the Philippines. For its first quarter, AB InBev said EBITDA came in at $4.99 billion, an organic increase of 8.2 percent. The overall figure was below the average forecast of $5.06 billion in a Reuters poll, but above the 7.9 percent consensus rise in a poll compiled by the company. AB InBev strips out changes in scope and currencies for its “organic” changes. Analysts said the mismatch between a greater than expected organic rise and a lower than expected absolute figure was likely due to a heavier impact of foreign currencies. The company’s share in its largest market, the United States, slipped by 0.1 percentage points but margins expanded as its higher priced beer such as Michelob Ultra grew.  Beer volumes in Brazil, its second largest market, rose by 11.3 percent, helped by the later timing this year of Carnival. However, challenging economic conditions in Argentina and South Africa led to lower beer sales there. The later timing of Easter in 2019 also capped earnings in some countries. The company’s shares, which fell by 38 percent last year over concerns over AB InBev’s debt and performance in its two largest markets, were up 1 percent at 78.3 euros at 0845 GMT. They are up by more than a third in the year to date.    Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman/Keith WeirAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

72,China's April forex reserves drop for first time in 6 months - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  8:47 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","2 Min ReadBEIJING, May 7 (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange reserves unexpectedly fell for the first time in six months in April, despite recent data that suggested the world’s second-largest economy is starting to steady in response to stimulus measures. The decline in China’s reserves, the world’s largest, was modest, however, falling $3.81 billion last month to $3.095 trillion, central bank data showed on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would rise $1.24 billion to $3.1 trillion. For much of last year, global investors worried about the risk of capital flight from China as the economy cooled, and debated how much Beijing would allow the yuan currency to weaken, though strict capital controls kept outflows in check. Unexpectedly strong March data suggested the economy is slowly getting back on steadier footing, but an unexpected escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions this week has put the yuan back under pressure and revived concerns over Chinese growth. In April, the yuan fell 0.3 percent against the dollar, while the dollar inched up 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies . The yuan fell 5.3 percent against the dollar last year as trade relations with the United States deteriorated and the Chinese economy slowed. Despite sharp losses on Monday following fresh U.S. tariff threats, the yuan is still up 1.6 percent against the dollar so far this year. The value of China’s gold reserves fell to $78.35 billion from $78.525 billion at the end of March. Reporting by Kevin Yao; Editing by Kim CoghillAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

73,EMERGING MARKETS-Stocks recover; lira tumbles over Istanbul's re-election - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  8:36 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","2 Min ReadMay 7 (Reuters) - Emerging-market shares recovered on Tuesday from their worst day this year amid reports Sino-U.S. trade talks would go ahead in Washington, despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on Chinese imports as soon as Friday. MSCI’s index for emerging-market shares advanced, helped by a rebound in mainland China shares, which rose after their worst drop in more than three years on Monday. Global equities were jolted on Monday as Trump threatened to raise tariffs. U.S. trade officials said the move came because Beijing had backtracked on commitments it made during earlier trade talks. But Chinese officials are still expected at talks in Washington this week. “We still expect a positive outcome to talks but ... investors need to protect the downside,” wrote UBS analysts in a note. Most Asian markets were gained, with the Shanghai Composite advancing 0.7 percent and the CSI 300 climbing 1.0 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.7 percent. South Korea’s Kospi was down 0.8 percent, however, after North Korea conducted a round of missile tests on Saturday. LIRA TUMBLES Among developing-world currencies, Turkey’s lira fell 1.3 percent after the Turkish election board announced Istanbul’s mayoral elections would be re-run. The country’s dollar-denominated government bonds saw their biggest selloff in months and the BIST 100 stock index dropped over 2 percent. The challenge by President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party to the March 31 election result in Istanbul, which showed a narrow victory for the opposition CHP party, has compounded investor worries about politics in Turkey in recent weeks.

74,"RPT-INSIGHT-As IPO looms, Uber clings to hard-knuckled tactics in pursuit of growth - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  8:32 AM / in 6 hours","8 Min Read(Repeats to additional clients, text unchanged) By Heather Somerville and Joe Bavier SAN FRANCISCO/ CAPE TOWN, May 7 (Reuters) - Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick used to tell investors he liked to keep his company teetering between order and chaos. By the time he left, it was chaos. The company was battered by a slew of scandals, including revelations it had used illicit tactics to handicap competitors and dodge regulators. Almost two years later, under new leadership and set to debut Friday on Wall Street in the largest U.S. public stock offering since 2014, Uber Technologies Inc is still testing the rule of law. With growth slowing, the company continues to spar with local officials around the world looking to limit Uber cars on their streets. In Cape Town, South Africa, for example, Uber dominates the market with an estimated 7,000 drivers, most of whom are operating illegally, according to city officials. Uber blames Cape Town’s “broken” system for approving ride-hailing licenses. In the United States, Uber has used the courts to try to block what it see as unreasonable restrictions on its business. And it has successfully lobbied state legislatures to pass laws preempting local ride-hailing regulations, much to the frustration of officials in some cities where it operates. Uber insiders say CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made strides in cleaning up a frat-house culture that spawned allegations of sexual harassment and embarrassing leaks of executives behaving badly. But Uber’s sharp-elbowed business tactics, detailed by lawmakers, city staff and regulators across the globe, as well as drivers and former employees, continue to drive the company. “It’s in the DNA,” a former Uber manager said. “Old habits die hard.” Whether its playbook delivers the growth and profitability public market investors will be seeking remains to be seen. Revenue growth slowed to 2.3% in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter, a worrisome sign for a business that lost more than $3 billion last year. Uber’s economics “are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,” Mark Hargraves, Head of Framlington Global Equities at AXA Investment Managers, said in a recent note to clients. An Uber spokesman declined to comment. In its IPO filing, the company said it is “using a proactive and collaborative approach with regulators” and “rebuilding and strengthening” its relationships with cities. Where ride-hailing is banned, Uber is instead offering e-bike services or partnering with traditional taxi companies. Still the company acknowledged “legal and regulatory obstacles” around the world that could impede its revenue and growth. Thousands of miles from Wall Street, Uber is pushing the bounds of regulation. In Chile, which has yet to work out a regulatory framework for ridesharing, Uber drivers have been known to enlist passengers to help them evade transit cops. In Mexico City, Uber has protested new safety rules it says would limit the number of riders who could use the app. In London, Uber is on probation after it was temporarily banned for flouting safety rules. And in Cape Town, Uber has entered its fifth year of a stalemate with local officials. Every ride-hailing service in Cape Town is allotted a certain number of operating licenses for its drivers. As of mid-April, Western Cape Province, where the city is located, had approved 760 such licenses for Uber. But the city estimates there are roughly 10 times that many Uber drivers plying its streets, many of them immigrants or refugees. Foreign-born drivers must also have work permits, paperwork many of them lack, according to city aldermen and drivers. Uber said it allows drivers to start work while their ride-hailing licenses are still pending approval but that the company thoroughly vets the drivers. A game of cat and mouse has ensued: drivers alert each other to the whereabouts of traffic cops through the WhatsApp mobile messaging service. If their cars are impounded, they pay the fines, start driving anew and wait for Uber to reimburse them. Those impound fines start at almost $500 and go up with each subsequent offense, topping out at more than $1,000. Drivers are fined an additional $173 each time. “It’s just like gangsterism fighting for turf,” said Ivan, a South African driver who gave only his first name. Uber has spent at least $2.3 million since 2016 to reimburse drivers for the impound fines, according to Reuters’ estimate based on data from the city. Uber declined to say how much it had spent, but said it would continue paying the fines to support its drivers and get them back on the road. South Africa is crucial to Uber’s Africa strategy, boasting the continent’s most-developed economy. A spokesperson for Uber South Africa said Cape Town’s licensing system “is effectively broken” and blamed the city for what it says is a backlog that can stretch for more than two years in some cases. The city estimates there is a market for about 2,100 Uber drivers. Alderman JP Smith said part of Cape Town’s calculus is to head off violence that could result if too many taxi drivers are put out of business by new ride-hailing rivals. In the larger cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg, some Uber drivers and cabbies have been killed and their cars torched as part of an ongoing turf war. “In other parts of the world, if there are too many taxis some just stop being taxis,” Smith said. “Here, disputes between taxis are settled via assassination and murder.” The face-off may not find a resolution any time soon. Cape Town is expanding its impound facilities so it can take in nearly twice the number of cars. Big cities concerned about gridlock, air quality and the safety of passengers and drivers are crafting new policies and demanding more data from ride-hailing companies to find solutions. Uber is pushing back. The company sued New York City in February over a law imposing a cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers, a move taken to address worsening traffic. In its hometown of San Francisco, Uber is fighting a court order to turn over data the city says would help improve traffic management and the safety of Uber drivers. As city officials in the United States have gotten scrappier, Uber has sought out friendlier state legislators to work around them. Over just four years, Uber and rival Lyft helped pass laws in 41 states that put ride-hailing under the state’s jurisdiction, preempting some or all local regulations, according to a 2018 study by the National Employment Law Project. Uber is now pushing legislation in Oregon that would preempt local mandates on driver caps, permits, data collection and access for passengers in wheelchairs, among others. Uber’s general manager for Oregon said the bill would create “increased mobility for rural and urban communities,” by bringing Uber to towns that currently do not allow it. Officials in Portland say their city is in the crosshairs. After Uber launched there in late 2014, Portland sued to stop its operation, declaring it illegal. That suit was later dropped, but Portland regulates Uber closely. Noah Siegel, interim assistant director at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said the proposed legislation would hurt the city’s ability to manage growth and ensure everyone can get around safely. “We were not really holding a lot of bad blood about what had happened” with Uber in the past, Siegel said. “But this bill serves as a reference point that it’s only been four years and they still haven’t turned a profit and they will do anything to make money.” Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco and Joe

75,Pound steadies near $1.31 as Brexit talks resume - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  8:21 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv LONDON, May 7 (Reuters) - The pound remained stuck near $1.31 as Brexit talks resumed on Monday between the British government and the main opposition party and traders refrained from taking positions on the currency. Negotiations between Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and the opposition Labour Party over the terms of Brexit, in particular the shape of a customs union, are deciding sterling’s direction. The British currency jumped to a one-month high on Friday on hopes the talks might lead to a Brexit deal, but a breakthrough is unlikely this week, the BBC’s political editor cited an unidentified senior government source as saying. “We do not expect to see much progress ahead of the next Brexit deadline at the end of October. This seems to be a view shared by the options market – the implied volatilities continue to trade close to the lows seen over the past years,” said Charlie Lay, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. May agreed a withdrawal deal with the EU last year, but it was rejected three times by a deeply divided British parliament. That delayed the exit date, a postponement that has weighed on the pound as investors fret about prolonged political uncertainty. Against the dollar, the pound traded flat at $1.3090 and was steady against the euro at 85.48 pence. Sterling has traded in a narrow range of $1.28-$1.31 since Britain last month pushed its scheduled departure from the European Union back from March until Oct. 31. There is still little clarity about when, how, or even if, Brexit will happen. Investors have been broadly impervious to tepid economic data recently and even relatively hawkish comments from the Bank of England last week failed to jolt the currency. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows and net positions by hedge funds in sterling have slipped back into negative territory.

76,Florida teachers can arm themselves under new gun bill - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  5:57 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Florida’s legislature on Wednesday passed a bill allowing teachers to carry guns in the classroom, expanding a program launched after the deadly high school shooting in Parkland with the aim of preventing another such massacre. Florida’s House of Representatives voted 65 to 47 to pass the bill after hours of debate over two days in which the Republican majority thwarted Democratic efforts to amend, stall or kill the measure. Florida’s Senate approved it 22 to 17 last week. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the bill into law, enabling school districts wishing to take part in the voluntary Guardian program to arm those teachers who pass a 144-hour training course. On Feb. 14, 2018, a former student armed with a semiautomatic rifle opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and wounding 17 others. President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association have argued an armed teacher could provide the best defense against a shooter bent on mass murder. Opponents questioned whether the solution to gun violence should be the presence of even more guns and warned of the danger of a teacher misfiring during a crisis or police mistaking an armed teacher for the assailant. Passage marks a victory for gun-rights advocates, who were on the defensive a year ago when Parkland students inspired nationwide protests in favor of gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Florida lawmakers rushed through legislation that required schools to place at least one armed staff member or law-enforcement officer at each campus. The law also imposed a three-day waiting period for gun purchases and raised the age limit for buying rifles from 18 to 21 - remarkable measures in a gun-friendly state. Although last year’s law allowed some school personnel to carry weapons, guns were still banned from the classroom.  Backers of arming classroom teachers revived the issue this year, arguing that school shootings often erupt too quickly for law enforcement to respond. In anticipation of passage, school employees in 40 of Florida’s 67 counties already enrolled in or planned to take the 144-hour course, a spokesman for the Speaker of the House said. Some counties have resolved not to participate in the Guardian program. Florida’s gun-control advocates had made stopping the proposal a top priority, among them Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense, which is funded by billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

77,Democratic Senator Bennet of Colorado joins crowded 2020 field - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  12:28 PM / in 5 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, whose political career has centered on improving the American education system, on Thursday became the latest Democrat to join the sprawling field of candidates seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Bennet, 54, is serving his second full six-year term in the Senate. He previously ran Denver’s public schools.  “If we continue to go down the path we’re going - and this isn’t just about President Trump, it’s about the politics that existed before he got there ... we’re going to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more, to the next generation, and I just need to do everything I can do to make sure that we don’t do that,” Bennet said in an interview with “CBS This Morning.” He joins a field of more than a dozen candidates, with others such as former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Montana Governor Steve Bullock still deciding whether to run.  Bennet is the second Coloradan to enter the 2020 race after John Hickenlooper, a former governor, announced his candidacy on March 4. Hickenlooper’s presence complicates Bennet’s bid. Both are white male moderates running in a party where much of the energy lies with the diverse, activist left.  Bennet is not well known nationally. However, his stint in 2014 as chairman of the Democratic Party’s Senate campaign arm linked him with a network of political operatives and donors across the country.  The normally congenial Bennet also drew notice during the partial U.S. government shutdown in January, when he blasted Republican Ted Cruz on the Senate floor for leading a similar shutdown in 2013 that stopped the flow of emergency funds to Colorado. Democratic nominating contests begin in February 2020 in the traditional starting point of Iowa. The candidate who amasses the majority of the delegates will be nominated at the party’s convention in the summer and will likely face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. Since losing the White House in 2016, Democrats have grappled with how to best take on Trump in 2020. Some in the party believe an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters is the way to victory. Others argue a fresh face - and particularly a diverse one - is needed to energize the party’s increasingly left-leaning base.  As a presidential candidate, Bennet may have to fight the perception that he is a product of the party’s establishment at a time when progressives and political newcomers are favored by the base. He grew up in Washington the son of a former State Department official, and his grandfather advised President Franklin Roosevelt. A graduate of Wesleyan University and Yale Law School, he served in the Clinton Justice Department before moving West. When Hickenlooper served as mayor of Denver, Bennet worked as his chief of staff and then took over the city’s schools, gaining national recognition for his reform efforts.  In 2009, after Democratic then-President Barack Obama named U.S. Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado as his interior secretary, Hickenlooper and Bennet vied to be appointed to replace him. Bennet, surprisingly, got the nod. He narrowly won his first full term a year later.  Bennet’s popularity has grown in Colorado as the state has become more liberal. In 2016, he was re-elected to the Senate by more than 5 percentage points, polling particularly well with Hispanic voters.  Bennet told CBS he was focused on economic mobility and integrity in government. In a campaign video, Bennet also highlighted goals that included improving the healthcare system and investing in education and job training. “The Democratic party doesn’t stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the American people think,” Bennet said. “A process like this is long overdue in the Democratic party.”   He also acknowledged his bout of prostate cancer, saying it was very “clarifying” in solidifying his plans for the future and that he now had a clean bill of health. The diagnosis also made him more sensitive to the need for Americans to have health insurance, he said.

78,"Barr cancels second day of testimony, escalating battle with U.S. Congress - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  10:04 AM / 5 days ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday canceled plans to testify before the House of Representatives about his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, further inflaming tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress. Barr was due to face the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but pulled out after the two sides were unable to agree on the format for the hearing. “It’s simply part of the administration’s complete stonewalling of Congress,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters.  Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Nadler’s proposal to have committee lawyers question Barr was “unprecedented and unnecessary,” saying questions should come from lawmakers.     The Justice Department also said on Wednesday it would not comply with a Nadler-issued subpoena seeking an unredacted version of Mueller’s report and underlying investigative files from the probe. Earlier on Wednesday, Barr spent more than four hours before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee where he fended off Democratic criticism of his decision to clear Trump of criminal obstruction of justice and faulted Special Counsel Robert Mueller for not reaching a conclusion of his own on the issue. In his first congressional testimony since releasing a redacted version of Mueller’s report on April 18, Barr also dismissed Mueller’s complaints that he initially disclosed the special counsel’s conclusions on March 24 in an incomplete way that caused public confusion. Illustrating tensions between the two men, Barr described as “a bit snitty” a March 27 letter from Mueller in which the special counsel urged him to release broader summaries of his findings - a step Barr rejected. Trump seized on Barr’s March 24 letter to declare that he had been fully exonerated. Several Democrats on the Senate committee called for Barr’s resignation. Democrats have accused Barr of trying to protect the Republican president, who is seeking re-election next year. They pressed Barr on why he decided two days after receiving the 448-page document from Mueller in March to conclude that Trump had not unlawfully sought to obstruct the 22-month investigation. “I don’t think the government had a prosecutable case,” Barr said. The report detailed extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign’s expectation that it would benefit from Russia’s actions, which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The report also detailed a series of actions Trump took to try to impede the investigation. Mueller, a former FBI director, concluded there was insufficient evidence to show a criminal conspiracy and opted not to make a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice, but pointedly did not exonerate him. Barr has said he and Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, then determined there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction.  Barr often appeared to excuse or rationalize Trump’s conduct, asserting that the president may not necessarily have been trying to derail Mueller’s investigation. Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono told Barr that he had sacrificed a “once-decent reputation for the grifter and liar that sits in the Oval Office.”  Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee’s Republican chairman, rushed to Barr’s defense, telling Hirono: “You’ve slandered this man.” Trump had been unfairly smeared, Barr said, by suspicions he had collaborated with Russia in the election. “Two years of his administration have been dominated by the allegations that have now been proven false. To listen to some of the rhetoric, you would think that the Mueller report had found the opposite,” Barr said. Barr was critical of Mueller for not reaching a conclusion himself on whether Trump obstructed the probe. “I think that if he felt that he shouldn’t go down the path of making a traditional prosecutorial decision, then he shouldn’t have investigated,” Barr said. Barr was asked about the report’s finding that Trump directed then-White House counsel Don McGahn in June 2017 to tell Rosenstein that Mueller had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the order. Rosenstein had appointed Mueller the prior month. Barr, appointed by Trump after the president fired his predecessor, Jeff Sessions, seemed to minimize the incident and said Trump believed “he never outright directed the firing of Mueller.” Trump could have presumably appointed someone else to do the job after Mueller was fired, he said. “We did not think in this case that the government could show corrupt intent,” Barr said.  Democrats on the panel were unconvinced. “I think the president’s intention was very clear. He wanted this to end,” Senator Dick Durbin said. Under questioning by Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, Barr acknowledged he did not review the investigation’s underlying evidence before deciding to clear Trump of obstruction. Barr disputed the view that Mueller was handing the baton to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings. “That would be very inappropriate,” Barr said. “That’s not what the Justice Department does.” The Democratic-controlled House would start any such impeachment effort, but Trump could not be removed from office without approval by a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Democrats also accused Barr of misleading Congress, by saying in April that he did not know whether Mueller agreed with his characterization of the report - failing to mention Mueller’s March 27 letter that Barr’s initial summary did not “fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office’s work.”  Barr testified that Mueller was unhappy with the way the conclusions were being characterized in the media, not his account of the conclusions, although Mueller’s letter did not mention media coverage. “The letter is a bit snitty,” Barr said, using a word meaning disagreeably ill-tempered, “and I think it was probably written by a member of his staff.” Several Democrats demanded that Mueller testify before the committee, but Graham ruled that out.  Committee Republicans did not focus on Trump’s conduct but rather on what they saw as the FBI’s improper surveillance during the 2016 race of Trump aides they suspected of being Russian agents, as well as on the Kremlin’s election meddling. Barr indicated that to him, the matter was closed. “The report is now in the hands of the American people,” he said. “We’re out of it. We have to stop using the criminal justice system as a political weapon.” Reporting by Andy Sullivan, Sarah N.

79,Yuan recoups most losses as Beijing confirms Vice Premier Liu's trip to U.S. - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  7:16 AM / Updated 7 hours ago","4 Min Read(Adds details, updates prices) SHANGHAI, May 7 (Reuters) - China’s yuan recouped most of its early losses on Tuesday afternoon after Beijing confirmed its top negotiator would go to Washington as planned for the next round of trade talks, despite U.S. threats to hike tariffs within days. China’s commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on May 9 and May 10 for trade talks at the invitation of senior U.S. officials. After months of negotiations and reports of progress, the talks appeared to be in danger of unraveling on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would raise existing tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday and impose fresh levies soon. If Liu joins the delegation flying the U.S., “it will signal how serious China is and indicates that China and the U.S. are going to talk further,” economists at ING said in a note earlier in the day. The yuan bounced in onshore trade following the Liu news to as high of 6.7628 per dollar at one point, trimming the intraday loss to 6 pips from the previous late night close of 6.7622. It opened at 6.7750 per dollar on Tuesday morning and trading at 6.7660 as of 0709 GMT. Liu’s presence could signal that “China will make concessions,” said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie in Hong Kong. “If China only sends a junior team to the U.S., the market might have to wait longer to see who blinks first,” Hu said. Chinese investors, caught off guard by Trump’s threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan on Monday, pushing the currency to a 3-1/2 month low at one point. Many global investors had thought that a trade deal was getting close. But markets were somewhat less jittery on Tuesday, amid expectations that Beijing would announce fresh measures to support the economy if the trade war escalates. Prior to the market opening, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) lowered its official yuan midpoint to a fresh 2-1/2-month low at 6.7614 per dollar,  270 pips, or 0.4 percent, weaker than the previous fix of 6.7344. Tuesday’s official fixing was the softest since Feb. 19, and the move was the biggest one-day weakening in percentage terms since Feb. 11. But the guidance rate unexpectedly came in much lower than market expectations. The midpoint was 97 pips weaker than Reuters’ estimate of 6.7517. “The RMB is likely to have more near-term downside risk with the fading of political goodwill on the currency around the trade negotiation,” Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist at Union Bancaire Privée, said in a note. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday that its team was still preparing to go to the U.S. for discussions and will work for a win-win agreement for both sides. Stephen Innes, head of trading at SPI Asset Management, said markets have not fully priced in the tariff hikes yet. “Yuan bulls need to be very cautious given the U.S. administration might follow through on its threat to raise the tariff on $200 billion to 25 percent, which is not priced into the currency calculus as the imposition of these additional tariffs could send us veering back to 6.85,” he said in a note on Tuesday. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.7782 per dollar as of 0709 GMT. (Reporting by Winni Zhou and Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Kim Coghill)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Japanese markets were closed April 27 to May 6 for the Golden Week holidays. Late on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by announcing he would hike tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday, triggering a global sell-off in stocks and other riskier assets which had been largely pricing in a trade deal. The Nikkei share average dropped 1.5 percent to 21,923.72, its lowest close since April 12. “Anything could have happened during the long holiday but the market had not priced in a potential breakdown of the U.S.-China trade talks,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. “That’s a totally unexpected scenario.” After the market close, China’s commerce ministry said Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on May 9 and May 10 for bilateral trade talks at the invitation of senior U.S. officials. Companies with high exposure to China such as construction equipment makers and factory automation machinery firms underperformed. Komatsu Ltd tumbled 10 percent, Yaskawa Electric dropped 6.4 percent and Fanuc Corp shed 3.2 percent. Apple suppliers also tanked as a double-whammy of concerns about earnings and fears about a fall in Chinese demand weighed. Taiyo Yuden nosedived 14.5 percent, while Foster Electric tumbled 12.2 percent after it expected an 11.1 percent drop in its operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 2020. Murata Manufacturing plunged 13.2 percent after it expected a 17.5 percent drop in its operating profit for this fiscal year and Alps Alpine dived 10.7 percent after it forecast a 22.1 percent fall in its operating profit for the first half of this fiscal year. Sony Corp soared 3.8 percent after the company expected to post an operating profit of 810 billion yen ($7.32 billion) for this fiscal year through March.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent, erasing earlier losses. It tumbled 2 percent on Monday after Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on Beijing in the midst of trade negotiations. Chinese shares staged a mild technical rebound but stayed choppy after their worst drop in more than three years on Monday. The benchmark Shanghai Composite was 0.5 percent higher, while the blue-chip CSI 300 rose 0.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.5 percent, taking a delayed hit as the country’s financial markets opened on Tuesday after a 10-day break to mark the ascension of a new emperor. Financial spread-betters expect London’s FTSE, Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC to fall between 0.1 and 0.3 percent when they open. U.S. stock futures for the S&P 500 declined as much as 0.8 percent in Asian trading hours on Tuesday as top U.S. officials said China had backtracked on commitments in trade talks. Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week and would “soon” target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs, prompting investors to dump risky assets on Monday. Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo, believed stocks have entered a new downtrend as investors had growing doubts over whether the United States and China would cut a deal on trade any time soon. “Investors had been too complacent since the beginning of this year. Now it’s time for ‘sell in May and go away,’” he said. Still, some investors are holding out hope that the tariff threats are a negotiating tactic. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he expected top Chinese negotiator Vice Premier Liu He would lead a delegation coming from Beijing for talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday. “Markets are still not sure (whether Trump will go ahead with the tariff hikes,) and far from a panicky situation. We have to see how the U.S.-China talks will unfold this week,” said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners. China’ yuan weakened further against the dollar on Tuesday, but the pace of losses slowed, as investors largely digested Trump’s tariff threats and started to seek clues for reaction from Beijing. The offshore yuan slipped 0.3 percent to 6.7939 per dollar while the onshore yuan also fell 0.3 percent to 6.7789 per dollar. Australia’s dollar became the biggest mover among the major currencies, strengthening as much as 0.9 percent to a one-week top of $0.7048, after the country central bank’s decision to hold rates wrongfooted some who had expected a cut. There had been some speculation it would ease policy given recent weak inflation. Other major currencies remained confined to well-trodden ranges on Tuesday, with the euro trading virtually flat at $1.1212 and the dollar holding steady at 110.63 yen . In the commodity market, oil futures traded steady to higher on Tuesday as U.S. sanctions on crude exporters Iran and Venezuela kept supply concerns alive. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures inched up to $62.34 per barrel while Brent crude oil futures were little changed at $71.23.

87,FOREX-Aussie jumps as RBA holds rates steady; dollar drifts lower - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  5:46 AM / Updated 9 hours ago","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Daniel Leussink TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar sharply rose on Tuesday after the country’s central bank held rates at a record low, dashing speculation it may ease policy following a below-par reading of inflation. The Aussie was last up about 0.7 percent at $0.7035 after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held its cash rate at 1.50 percent. Ahead of the policy decision, a slim majority of economists polled by Reuters had expected the central bank to keep rates steady, even as calls for an easing grew louder after disappointingly weak first-quarter inflation. While the RBA kept policy unchanged, it opened the door wider for future cuts if the jobs market failed to push unemployment lower as retailers suffered their worst quarter in seven years. Against the yen, the Aussie was last up about 0.5 percent at 77.82 yen. Elsewhere in currency markets, the dollar kept largely to familiar ranges against major peers, even as comments from top U.S. trade officials that China had moved away from trade-related commitments weighed on U.S. bond yields and stock futures. The dollar index against a basket of six rivals was last down 0.1 percent at 97.409, having ended the previous session nearly flat. “From China’s perspective, a break up in negotiations isn’t really favourable for the domestic economy. I think they want to get a deal one way or the other,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. While there had been talk that Washington and Beijing might reach a trade deal this week, it is likely the negotiations will take a bit more time, he added. Late on Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China had moved away from commitments made over the course of trade negotiations. Lighthizer said his office would probably put out a notice on Tuesday about a proposed increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Futures for the S&P 500 fell following the remarks. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields hit their lowest since May 1. The dollar dipped slightly against the euro and the pound on Tuesday, though its moves against those currencies were much less pronounced than the Aussie’s moves. The euro last changed hands at $1.1210, up 0.1 percent on the day. Sterling rose about 0.2 percent to $1.3122 . Against the yen, the dollar was down a tenth of a percent at 110.615 yen. It had brushed a five-week low of 110.285 yen per dollar during the previous session.

89,U.S. military not given orders to prepare for war in Venezuela - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  3:00 PM / 6 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday appeared to downplay any active preparations to directly intervene in Venezuela to topple President Nicolas Maduro, but acknowledged detailed contingency planning as political turmoil in the oil-rich nation deepens. Hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was prepared to take military action, if necessary, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the United States had carried out “exhaustive planning” on Venezuela. But he and other officials continued to emphasize diplomatic and economic pressure as a way to help oust Maduro, as opposed to a U.S.-military led regime change. Asked at one point whether the U.S. military had been given instructions to prepare for a conflict in Venezuela, perhaps by prepositioning U.S. troops, Kathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said: “We, of course, always review available options and plan for contingencies. “But in this case we have not been given (the) sort of orders that you’re discussing, no,” Wheelbarger told the House Armed Services Committee. So far, the U.S. military has been largely a spectator amid  the unfolding U.S. foreign policy decisions on Venezuela, although it offered small contributions, like helping shuttle humanitarian aid to Colombia for further transport to Venezuela. It has also ramped up its intelligence collection and intelligence sharing with allies, like Colombia, while planning for a possible non-combatant evacuation of Americans from Venezuela, should the need arise.  Such planning is standard in any crisis of Venezuela’s magnitude. The top uniformed U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, said he was focused on intelligence gathering and being prepared to respond, if Trump sought greater involvement by the Pentagon. But he stressed that the military should act in a way that deepens its partnerships in Latin America — where the prospect of U.S. military intervention is deeply unpopular. “I think it really is very, very important that we work with others in the region to solve this problem,” Dunford said. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela’s president by some 50 countries including the United States, has so far failed to enlist Venezuela’s military leaders in his bid to remove Maduro from power. He faced a high-profile test of support on Wednesday after calling for the “largest march” in Venezuela’s history. U.S. Navy Admiral Craig Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Latin America, said a big focus for the United States and its partners in the region would be helping to restore vital Venezuelan economic infrastructure after Maduro’s exit — something he called “Day Now” planning. “We call it ‘Day Now’ because there is going to be a day when the legitimate government takes over, and it’s going to come when we least expect it — and it could be right now,” Faller said. When asked if he saw a role for the U.S. military in actually overthrowing Maduro’s government, Faller said: “Our leadership’s been clear: It has to be, should be, primarily a democratic transition.” Still, he said Southern Command was ready to act if called upon for any scenario. “We’re on the balls of our feet,” he said. In a sign the crisis was grabbing the full attention of Trump’s national security leaders, Shanahan canceled a planned trip to Europe on Wednesday, in part to help coordinate with the White House National Security Council and State Department on Venezuela. The National Security Council scheduled a meeting for Wednesday afternoon to discuss next steps.

92,"As IPO looms, Uber clings to hard-knuckled tactics in pursuit of growth - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  5:03 AM / Updated 4 hours ago","8 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO/ CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Uber co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick used to tell investors he liked to keep his company teetering between order and chaos. By the time he left, it was chaos. The company was battered by a slew of scandals, including revelations it had used illicit tactics to handicap competitors and dodge regulators.  Almost two years later, under new leadership and set to debut Friday on Wall Street in the largest U.S. public stock offering since 2014, Uber Technologies Inc is still testing the rule of law.  With growth slowing, the company continues to spar with local officials around the world looking to limit Uber cars on their streets. In Cape Town, South Africa, for example, Uber dominates the market with an estimated 7,000 drivers, most of whom are operating illegally, according to city officials. Uber blames Cape Town’s “broken” system for approving ride-hailing licenses. In the United States, Uber has used the courts to try to block what it see as unreasonable restrictions on its business. And it has successfully lobbied state legislatures to pass laws preempting local ride-hailing regulations, much to the frustration of officials in some cities where it operates. Uber insiders say CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has made strides in cleaning up a frat-house culture that spawned allegations of sexual harassment and embarrassing leaks of executives behaving badly.   But Uber’s sharp-elbowed business tactics, detailed by lawmakers, city staff and regulators across the globe, as well as drivers and former employees, continue to drive the company. “It’s in the DNA,” a former Uber manager said. “Old habits die hard.” Whether its playbook delivers the growth and profitability public market investors will be seeking remains to be seen. Revenue growth slowed to 2.3% in the fourth quarter over the previous quarter, a worrisome sign for a business that lost more than $3 billion last year.  Uber’s economics “are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,” Mark Hargraves, Head of Framlington Global Equities at AXA Investment Managers, said in a recent note to clients. An Uber spokesman declined to comment. In its IPO filing, the company said it is “using a proactive and collaborative approach with regulators” and “rebuilding and strengthening” its relationships with cities. Where ride-hailing is banned, Uber is instead offering e-bike services or partnering with traditional taxi companies. Still the company acknowledged “legal and regulatory obstacles” around the world that could impede its revenue and growth.  Thousands of miles from Wall Street, Uber is pushing the bounds of regulation. In Chile, which has yet to work out a regulatory framework for ridesharing, Uber drivers have been known to enlist passengers to help them evade transit cops. In Mexico City, Uber has protested new safety rules it says would limit the number of riders who could use the app. In London, Uber is on probation after it was temporarily banned for flouting safety rules. And in Cape Town, Uber has entered its fifth year of a stalemate with local officials.  Every ride-hailing service in Cape Town is allotted a certain number of operating licenses for its drivers. As of mid-April, Western Cape Province, where the city is located, had approved 760 such licenses for Uber. But the city estimates there are roughly 10 times that many Uber drivers plying its streets, many of them immigrants or refugees. Foreign-born drivers must also have work permits, paperwork many of them lack, according to city aldermen and drivers.  Uber said it allows drivers to start work while their ride-hailing licenses are still pending approval but that the company thoroughly vets the drivers. A game of cat and mouse has ensued: drivers alert each other to the whereabouts of traffic cops through the WhatsApp mobile messaging service. If their cars are impounded, they pay the fines, start driving anew and wait for Uber to reimburse them.  Those impound fines start at almost $500 and go up with each subsequent offense, topping out at more than $1,000. Drivers are fined an additional $173 each time. “It’s just like gangsterism fighting for turf,” said Ivan, a South African driver who gave only his first name. Uber has spent at least $2.3 million since 2016 to reimburse drivers for the impound fines, according to Reuters’ estimate based on data from the city. Uber declined to say how much it had spent, but said it would continue paying the fines to support its drivers and get them back on the road. South Africa is crucial to Uber’s Africa strategy, boasting the continent’s most-developed economy.  A spokesperson for Uber South Africa said Cape Town’s licensing system “is effectively broken” and blamed the city for what it says is a backlog that can stretch for more than two years in some cases.  The city estimates there is a market for about 2,100 Uber drivers. Alderman JP Smith said part of Cape Town’s calculus is to head off violence that could result if too many taxi drivers are put out of business by new ride-hailing rivals. In the larger cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg, some Uber drivers and cabbies have been killed and their cars torched as part of an ongoing turf war. “In other parts of the world, if there are too many taxis some just stop being taxis,” Smith said. “Here, disputes between taxis are settled via assassination and murder.” The face-off may not find a resolution any time soon. Cape Town is expanding its impound facilities so it can take in nearly twice the number of cars. Big cities concerned about gridlock, air quality and the safety of passengers and drivers are crafting new policies and demanding more data from ride-hailing companies to find solutions. Uber is pushing back. The company sued New York City in February over a law imposing a cap on the number of ride-hailing drivers, a move taken to address worsening traffic. In its hometown of San Francisco, Uber is fighting a court order to turn over data the city says would help improve traffic management and the safety of Uber drivers.  As city officials in the United States have gotten scrappier, Uber has sought out friendlier state legislators to work around them. Over just four years, Uber and rival Lyft helped pass laws in 41 states that put ride-hailing under the state’s jurisdiction, preempting some or all local regulations, according to a 2018 study by the National Employment Law Project.  Uber is now pushing legislation in Oregon that would preempt local mandates on driver caps, permits, data collection and access for passengers in wheelchairs, among others. Uber’s general manager for Oregon said the bill would create “increased mobility for rural and urban communities,” by bringing Uber to towns that currently do not allow it. Officials in Portland say their city is in the crosshairs. After Uber launched there in late 2014, Portland sued to stop its operation, declaring it illegal. That suit was later dropped, but Portland regulates Uber closely.  Noah Siegel, interim assistant director at the Portland Bureau of Transportation, said the proposed legislation would hurt the city’s ability to manage growth and ensure everyone can get around safely.  “We were not really holding a lot of bad blood about what had happened” with Uber in the past, Siegel said. “But this bill serves as a reference point that it’s only been four years and they still haven’t turned a profit and they will do anything to make money.” Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco and Joe Bavier in Cape Town.

93,"U.S.: China reneged on trade commitments, sparking Trump tariff hike - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  9:02 AM / Updated 6 hours ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - China backtracked on substantial commitments it made during trade talks with the United States, prompting President Donald Trump to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods slated to go into effect on Friday, top U.S. trade officials said on Monday. The swift deterioration in negotiations between the world’s two largest economies hit global financial markets as investors faced the prospect of an escalation rather than an end to a 10-month-old trade war. Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week, and would “soon” target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs, sending stocks and oil prices lower on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has been an advocate for tough structural changes in China, said Beijing had reneged on commitments it had made previously that would have changed the agreement substantially. “Over the course of the last week or so we have seen ... an erosion in commitments by China,” Lighthizer told reporters. “That in our view is unacceptable.” Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is expected to be in Washington on Thursday and Friday for further talks. “We’re not breaking off talks at this point. But for now ... come Friday there will be tariffs in place,” Lighthizer said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, considered to be less hawkish toward China, said China’s backtracking became clear with “new information” over the weekend. He declined to give specifics and said the U.S. side had originally hoped to conclude a deal one way or the other this week. “They were trying to go back on language that had been previously negotiated, very clear language, that had the potential of changing the deal dramatically,” Mnuchin said. “The entire economic team ... are completely unified and recommended to the president to move forward with tariffs if we are not able to conclude a deal by the end of the week.” A spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to queries about the U.S. assertions. “We are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation. What I can tell you is that China’s team is preparing to go to the United States for the discussions,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday in Beijing. China has repeatedly said it will make changes to open its economy according to its own timeline, not in response to trade disputes. But recently it has enacted new laws and amended others, moves some see as efforts to address concerns shared by the United States and other foreign investors, including those from  China’s largest trading partner, the European Union. In March, China fast-tracked the approval of a new Foreign Investment Law, with Premier Li Keqiang pledging that the government would follow through and enforce the legislation giving protection to foreign firms. Last month, the standing committee of China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament amended three laws to strengthen trade secrets protections, take further measures to stop forced technology transfers and increase trademark infringement punishments. GRAPHIC: U.S. trade disputes around the world - tmsnrt.rs/2VHeF4n Trump’s announcement on Sunday abruptly ended a five-month truce in a trade war that has cost the two countries billions of dollars, slowed global growth and disrupted manufacturing supply chains and U.S. farm exports. Businesses, while largely supportive of Trump’s tough stance on China, want the tariffs to be lifted. Mnuchin said on Monday the stock market reaction was not affecting U.S. decisions on the talks.  A person familiar with the negotiations said the latest dispute came after the Chinese sought to deal with policy changes through administrative and regulatory actions, not through changes to Chinese law as previously agreed. “It undermines the core architecture of the deal,” the person said, adding that not codifying the concessions would make it difficult to verify and enforce China’s compliance. While it is unclear which changes to law the United States has demanded, critics say even though such amendments are welcomed, they do not provide guarantees because Chinese courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party.  U.S. officials have acknowledged this, and insist only  tariffs can provide leverage to enforce an agreement.  The United States is demanding sweeping changes to China’s economic policies, including better protection of U.S. intellectual property, and an end to forced technology transfers from U.S. companies and cyber theft of American trade secrets. Washington also wants more access to China’s markets for U.S. businesses, curbs on industrial subsidies and increased purchases of American products. Another source familiar with the situation said Trump had reiterated to advisers in recent days he would walk away from a trade deal with China if it was not strong enough. China’s nationalist Global Times tabloid said in an editorial on Tuesday that the foreign ministry’s suggestion it would still send a delegation to the United States after Trump’s remarks showed that China would remain calm and “focus on the talks rather than engage in public opinion warfare”. “Even if the negotiations break down and Washington comprehensively raises tariffs, that does not mean the door to talks is closed,” the paper said, adding that the impact on China of such a failure would be “controllable”.  The United States imported about $539.5 billion in goods from China in 2018 and exported $120.3 billion, for a record trade deficit of $419.2 billion, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Trump lashed out over the trade deficit with China on Monday. “With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we’re not going to be doing that anymore!” he tweeted.  GRAPHIC: U.S. farm country reels from trade war - tmsnrt.rs/2BYCdun The United States currently has 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese machinery and technology goods, and 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of products from computer modems and routers to furniture, lighting and building materials. Negotiations on removing U.S. tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points. China wants the tariffs to be removed. U.S. officials want to keep some, if not all, as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments.

94,Democrats' suit against Trump over foreign payment can proceed: judge - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:32 AM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Democrats in Congress can move forward with a lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump of violating the law by accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments through his businesses. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan denied a motion by Trump to dismiss the lawsuit filed by 198 members of Congress. The lawmakers charge the president violated the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which prevents federal officeholders from accepting payments from foreign governments without the “consent” of Congress. The constitutional provision is designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence. Sullivan said in his 48-page decision that he found Trump’s attempt to narrowly define the emoluments clause to be “unpersuasive and inconsistent.” He said he agreed with congressional Democrats who brought the case that the clause should be read more broadly as barring an official from taking any payment of any kind whatsoever from a foreign state without congressional approval. Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said: “As we argued, we believe this case should be dismissed, and we will continue to defend the President in court.” Democratic U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler called the ruling “an important milestone in seeking to hold the President accountable for his ongoing violations” of the emoluments clause. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs, maintains ownership of his businesses but has ceded day-to-day control to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. The lawsuit by congressional Democrats is one of two cases against Trump involving the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In the other case, Democratic attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia argued that Trump’s failure to disentangle himself from his hotels and other businesses made him vulnerable to inducements by foreign officials seeking to curry favor. The case was later narrowed to focus specifically on Trump’s hotel in Washington. Since his election, the hotel has become a favored lodging and event space for some foreign and state officials visiting the U.S. capital. A federal judge in that case also rejected Trump’s narrow view that emoluments were limited essentially to outright bribes. But an appeals court is reviewing the case and has temporarily frozen evidence-gathering that could force disclosure of Trump’s financial records.

95,Trump to meet with Republican senators on U.S. shipping rules - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  8:11 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is set to meet with Republican senators on Wednesday over a proposal to waive rules that only U.S.-flagged ships can move natural gas from American ports to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Northeast. The nearly 100-year-old Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. Bloomberg News reported last week the administration was seriously considering waiving the requirements for some energy shipments and that Trump was leaning in favor of some kind of waiver. “I am going to go to the White House tomorrow to try to talk to the president out of doing something foolish and that is trying to curtain the Jones Act protections,” Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told Reuters on Tuesday. “If that is his inclination, then (Trump) has been receiving some bad advice.” The White House declined to comment. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week to allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels to ensure enough fuel reached emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and following Hurricane Harvey. A person briefed on the matter confirmed that administration officials were divided on the issue. Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and a number of other Republicans are set to attend the meeting that had not previously been made public, he said. “There is massive support in the Congress for keeping the Jones Act as it is. We don’t need to tinker with it,” Wicker said on Tuesday, saying it had strong “across-the-board” bipartisan support. At the White House meeting, Wicker said: “We’ll be talking policy and politics.” Any changes would not go over well in Congress “at all, in either party,” he said.  In February, leaders of the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure wrote DHS to oppose a request from Puerto Rico to waive the Jones Act for 10 years to allow foreign tankers to move liquid natural gas to the U.S. island territory. Puerto Rico is still recovering from devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017. Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the committee, and Sam Graves, the panel’s top Republican, said in the letter the Jones Act “has promoted economic growth and national security, and created hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in our domestic maritime trades and shipbuilding industries.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

96,Mueller complained to Barr about his summary of Russia probe: Washington Post - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:04 AM / in 7 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller complained in a letter to Attorney General William Barr that his four-page summary of Mueller’s Russia report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the investigation’s conclusions, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. The Post said it reviewed a copy of Mueller’s letter, which was written in late March after Barr released a summary on March 24 that said Mueller did not establish that members of President Donald Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election. Barr also said in the summary that Mueller had not reached a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had found the evidence insufficient to support such a charge. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec, in a statement, confirmed that Mueller wrote to Barr after the summary was released to express frustration over “the lack of context and the resulting media coverage,” particularly about Mueller’s conclusions on obstruction of justice. Democrats have accused Barr of trying to spin the report’s conclusions to protect Trump. In a statement in response to the Post report, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Barr “should not have taken it upon himself to describe the Special Counsel’s findings in a light more favorable to the President.” The Democratic lawmaker demanded the Justice Department release a copy of Mueller’s letter by Wednesday morning. Barr’s four-page summary was released more than three weeks before a redacted version of Mueller’s 448-page report was released to the public on April 18. “The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote, according to the Post. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations,” the Post quoted Mueller as writing. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment to Reuters. Mueller asked Barr to release the report’s introductions and executive summaries quickly, without waiting for the full report to go through the redaction process. “Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation,” Mueller wrote, according to the Post. Kupec said after receiving Mueller’s letter, Barr called the special counsel and they had a “cordial and professional conversation.” Kupec said “the Special Counsel emphasized nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading.” She said Barr declined Mueller’s request to release part of the report early, deciding “it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion.” Mueller’s letter is likely to be brought up when Barr testifies on Wednesday about the Russia investigation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It will be the attorney general’s first appearance on Capitol Hill since the report’s release.

98,Ex-Goldman Sachs banker Ng pleads not guilty to 1MDB charges - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:57 AM / in 10 hours","4 Min Read (The story was refiled to correct the nationality of Ng in paragraph 3) By Elizabeth Dilts and Rozanna Latiff (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Roger Ng pleaded not guilty to criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at the Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB in an appearance at federal court in New York on Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice accused 46-year-old Ng last year of conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that Goldman Sachs handled. He was extradited on May 3 to New York from Kuala Lumpur, where he had been jailed since November. U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo, of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, allowed Ng, a Malaysian citizen, to be released in exchange for a $20 million bond. He was fitted for an ankle bracelet, and will be staying at an undisclosed location in the New York City area that the court approved. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said he convinced Ng to “come to the U.S. and face the music” because it was evident that prosecutors were not going to drop the case, and his client had become very ill. Ng appears to have lost weight, based on photos of him before his arrest. “He was in a very difficult situation,” Agnifilo told reporters. Being detained in New York “is better than a Malaysian jail,” he added. Ng, who left Goldman Sachs in 2014, faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of the three charges against him in the United States, based on alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Prosecutors and Ng’s lawyer are trying to negotiate a plea bargain. Government lawyers said they hope to avoid a trial by reaching a deal, though Agnifilo said it was too early to tell. Malaysia’s home minister wanted Ng to face criminal charges there first, but agreed to temporarily surrender him to the United States for 10 months, Malaysia’s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement. “The period of temporary surrender may be extended upon mutual agreement by Malaysia and the U.S.,” Thomas added. The 1MDB case has shaken Goldman Sachs, which is also being probed by the Justice Department for its role as underwriter and arranger for some $6.5 billion worth of 1MDB bond offerings. Prosecutors estimate that high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates misappropriated $4.5 billion between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used. Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales.  Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs banker, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty. In a statement, Low’s spokesman Paul Caminiti criticized the  Malaysian government for “inhumane prison conditions” and  called its motivation with the United States politically motivated.   Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has consistently denied wrongdoing through spokesmen. Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib, who lost a general election last year, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

100,JGBs gain as renewed trade worries stoke demand for safe-haven debt - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  4:42 AM / Updated 10 hours ago","2 Min ReadTOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices gained across the board on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week rekindled fears of a trade war, stoking demand for safe-haven debt. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.5 percent as investors returned from a 10-day holiday and faced concerns that the U.S.-China trade negotiations may be derailed. The five-year and 10-year JGB yields each declined by a basis point to minus 0.180 percent and minus 0.060 percent, respectively. The 30-year yield dropped 2 basis points to 0.540 percent . The JGB market took in stride the Bank of Japan’s decision to trim the amount of JGBs with 10 to 25 years of maturity it plans to buy at its regular JGB-purchasing operations in May. The central bank announced at the end of last month that it will buy 100 billion yen to 250 billion yen ($903 million to $2.26 billion) of 10- to 25-year maturity JGBs at each operation this month, compared with the 150 billion-250 billion yen range it had set for April. The BOJ’s balance sheet has ballooned with JGBs due to extensive monetary easing, and it has been gradually trimming the amount of debt it buys at market operations. $1 = 110.6500 yen

101,"FOREX-Dollar keeps to tight ranges, Aussie in focus ahead of RBA decision - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  4:17 AM / Updated 10 hours ago","4 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Daniel Leussink TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar remained not far off a five-week low against the yen on Tuesday, after worries about U.S.-China trade tensions rekindled fears about the outlook for global growth. The Australian dollar rose versus the U.S. currency as investors’ immediate focus turned to an imminent rate decision by Australia’s central bank. The greenback kept largely to familiar ranges against most major peers, even as comments from top U.S. trade officials that China had moved away from trade-related commitments weighed on U.S. bond yields and stock futures. The dollar index against a basket of six rivals was a shade lower at 97.436, having ending the previous session nearly flat. “From China’s perspective, a break up in negotiations isn’t really favourable for the domestic economy. I think they want to get a deal one way or the other,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. While there had been talk that Washington and Beijing might reach a trade deal this week, it is likely the negotiations will take a bit more time, he added. Against the yen, the dollar was down a tenth of a percent at 110.63 yen. It had brushed a five-week low of 110.285 yen per dollar during the previous session. The Japanese currency tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation. Late on Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China had moved away from commitments made over the course of trade negotiations. Lighthizer said his office would probably put out a notice on Tuesday about a proposed increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Futures for the S&P 500 fell following the remarks. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields hit their lowest since May 1. The Aussie was up 0.1 percent at $0.6995 ahead of the policy decision of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). That still put it near a four-month low hit on Monday, when it dropped more than half a percent following the resurgence of Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Still, the Aussie’s drop in response to the renewed tensions between Beijing and Washington had been relatively muted, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. “The market has already priced in more than two cuts by the RBA in the next year. Speculative short positions have already piled up to a relatively large amount,” Yamamoto said. “That’s why the reaction to the negative news has been relatively limited.” A slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expected the RBA to keep rates at a record low of 1.50 percent, though calls for an easing have grown louder after disappointingly weak first-quarter inflation. The dollar moved largely in familiar trading ranges against other units. The euro and sterling both booked a modest gain against the dollar, changing hands at $1.1206 and $1.3119 , respectively.

Shares of the group rose as much as 4 percent on Monday as trading resumed after Japan’s extended “Golden Week” holidays. Following the listing of the group’s domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December, the Vision Fund is the largest segment in SoftBank’s earnings without a market valuation.  It is, however, unclear how the world’s largest technology investment fund could be listed in its current form. SoftBank is expected to post on Thursday a 1 percent rise in operating profit to 156 billion yen ($1.41 billion) for the three months ended March, an average estimate of three analysts polled by Refinitiv shows. SoftBank has not provided a forecast and moved to new accounting standards this financial year.  The results come at a potential inflection point for the group and the Vision Fund as portfolio companies like Uber Technologies and the owner of WeWork, The We Company, prepare to list, putting a price tag on some of the conglomerate’s largest bets on unlisted startups. With investors struggling to quantify Vision Fund’s growing investments amid a lack of clarity over its valuation methods, analysts think the listings could help underscore its strategy. Given the group’s focus on technology companies, “if something happens to that sector it could be very negative”, said Dan Baker, an analyst at Morningstar. Uber is set to price its $10 billion IPO on May 9, seeking a valuation of up to $90 billion. That is lower than what Uber insiders had hoped for, but investors have reported strong demand for the shares. The lower valuation comes after rival Lyft Inc’s poor stock performance after its market debut. That reflects investor scepticism over Lyft’s path to profitability, with peers likes Uber and WeWork also heavily losing money. In China, Sequoia Capital China, viewed as a bellwether for tech investment, is set to lay off as much as 20 percent of investment staff as a slowdown in the tech sector saps appetite for risk, two people have said. While the Vision Fund has previously profitably exited its stakes in Indian online retailer FlipKart, which it sold to Walmart, and in already-public chipmaker Nvidia Corp, Uber will be its first portfolio company to go public. SoftBank’s rapidly growing investments continue to cause investor headaches in valuing the business, while also raising concerns about returns and SoftBank’s indebtedness.  Last week, a newly created Latin America-focused fund under SoftBank Group COO Marcelo Claure made its first move after SoftBank announced a $1 billion investment in Colombian delivery app Rappi. SoftBank Group’s domestic telco reports its financial results a day ahead of its parent. Three analysts on average see a weak end to SoftBank Corp’s year, with operating profit set to fall 11 percent to 94 billion yen.  While the telco hopes a series of joint ventures with SoftBank portfolio companies will help drive growth, pressure on carrier fees have left many investors in wait-and-see mode.  Sprint Corp, a SoftBank unit, and T-Mobile US Inc last month extended the deadline for completing their $26 billion merger, as regulators have yet to decide whether to approve the transaction announced a year ago. SoftBank Group’s shares have risen 60 percent this year, but the telco’s shares are down 5 percent and languish 14 percent below their December 1,500 yen IPO price. SoftBank Group’s shares were up 0.9 percent at 1300 local time (0400 GMT), while SoftBank Corp’s shares down 1.3 percent in line with the broader market.

103,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares off 5-week low, remain fragile on renewed US-China trade worries - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  3:26 AM / Updated 11 hours ago","4 Min Read* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Lighthizer:China reneged on commitments; E-Mini futures slip * U.S.-China talks to continue Thu, Fri; Chinese VP due to attend * Nikkei falls as markets reopen after 10-day break By Tomo Uetake SYDNEY, May 7 (Reuters) - Asian shares staggered up from five-week lows on Tuesday but remained fragile after U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods shocked financial markets and fueled worries that trade talks may be derailed. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, erasing earlier losses. It tumbled 2 percent on Monday after Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on Beijing in the midst of trade negotiations. Chinese shares rose after their worst drop in more than three years on Monday. The benchmark Shanghai Composite advanced 0.6 percent, while the blue-chip CSI 300 climbed 1.0 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, taking a delayed hit as the country’s financial markets opened after a 10-day break to mark the ascension of a new emperor. U.S. stock futures for the S&P 500 declined as much as 0.8 percent in Asian trading hours on Tuesday as top U.S. trade officials said China had backtracked on commitments in trade talks. Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week, and would “soon” target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs. Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo said believed stocks have entered a new downtrend, as investors had growing doubts over whether the United States and China would cut a deal on trade any time soon. “Investors had been too complacent since the beginning of this year. Now it’s time for ‘sell in May and go away,’” he said. Still, some investors are holding out hope that the tariff threats are a negotiating tactic. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he expected top Chinese negotiator Vice Premier Liu He would lead a delegation coming from Beijing for talks in Washington on Thursday and Friday. “Markets are still not sure (whether Trump will go ahead with the tariff hikes,) and far from a panicky situation. We have to see how the talks will unfold this week,” said Naoki Iwami, fixed income chief investment officer at Whiz Partners in Tokyo. There was little movement in the currency market, with the euro trading virtually flat at $1.1204, having held in a tight range for the past four sessions, while the dollar was steady at 110.70 yen. China’s yuan rebounded off four-month lows touched previous day, with the offshore unit gaining 0.2 percent to 6.7864 per dollar and the onshore yuan rising 0.2 percent to 6.7727 per dollar. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.6999 though investors remained cautious ahead of an interest rate decision from the country’s central bank later in the day. A slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expects the central bank to keep rates at a record low although calls for a rate cut have grown louder after disappointingly weak first-quarter inflation. In the commodity market, oil prices were mixed as U.S. sanctions on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela kept markets on edge, while concerns that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade dispute could slow the global economy also kept crude somewhat in check. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were marginally up at $62.27 per barrel while Brent crude oil futures inched 0.1 percent lower at $71.14.

105,Nikkei falls as traders return to spike in U.S.-China trade tensions - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  2:42 AM / in 12 hours","3 Min Read* Nikkei falls to lowest since early April at one point * Apple suppliers tank on double whammy of earnings and China demand concerns * Sony soars after it forecasts better-than-expected profit By Ayai Tomisawa TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei fell on Tuesday as investors returned from a 10-day holiday to worries that U.S.-China trade talks may be at risk of breaking down. Apple Inc’s suppliers and factory automation machinery firms also succumbed to heavy selling. The Nikkei share average dropped 1 percent to 22,026.32 points by mid-morning, after falling to as low as 21,965.60 earlier, the lowest level since mid-April. Japanese markets were closed April 27 to May 6 for the Golden Week holidays. Late on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump stunned financial markets by announcing he would hike tariffs on Chinese goods on Friday, triggering a global sell-off in stocks and other riskier assets which had been largely pricing in a trade deal. “Anything could have happened during the long holiday but the market had not priced in a potential breakdown of the U.S.-China trade talks,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. “That’s a totally unexpected scenario.” U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also said the Trump administration would “probably” publish a notice on Tuesday about plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Companies with high exposure to China such as construction equipment makers and factory automation machinery firms underperformed. Komatsu Ltd tumbled 9.1 percent, Yaskawa Electric dropped 4.5 percent and Fanuc Corp shed 2.3 percent. Apple suppliers also tanked as a double-whammy of concerns about earnings and fears about a fall in China’s demand weighed. Taiyo Yuden nosedived 16 percent, while Foster Electric tumbled 11 percent after it expected an 11.1 percent drop in its operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 2020. Murata Manufacturing dived as much as 15 percent after it expected a 17.5 percent drop in its operating profit for this fiscal year and Alps Alpine fell 11 percent after it forecast a 22.1 percent fall in its operating profit for the first half of this fiscal year. On the other hand, Softbank Group Corp rose as much as 4 percent before it trimmed its gains to be up 0.7 percent after a source said on Friday that the company is considering an initial public offering of its $100 billion Vision Fund. Sony Corp soared 6 percent after the company expected to post an operating profit of 810 billion yen ($7.32 billion) for this fiscal year through March. It would be a 9.4 percent fall on the year but above the market consensus of 700-750 billion yen, according to SMBC Nikko Securities. The broader Topix dropped 0.5 percent to 1,609.55.

107,"With Biden in, crowded 2020 Democratic field starts to get feisty - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  7:53 PM / in 7 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 2020 Democratic White House race, until now a cordial affair with no personal attacks and few policy disputes, is starting to get scrappy. Since former Vice President Joe Biden entered last week as the front-runner to win the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has taken a swing at Biden’s support for global trade deals and his 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war. Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas questioned Biden’s backing from big-money outside political groups, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has noted Biden’s work “on the side of the credit card companies.” Washington Governor Jay Inslee took aim at a different rival, criticizing O’Rourke’s congressional record on climate change after O’Rourke unveiled a $5 trillion plan to invest in clean energy technology and infrastructure. With 20 Democrats vying for attention in the battle for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in 2020, some in the party said it was only a matter of time before they began to turn on each other. And Biden, clearly in the lead in polls, provides an easy target for the herd now that he has formally joined the race. “It’s just the beginning,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “In a big field, there will be some early skirmishes as people position themselves.” The criticism of Biden, a centrist who spent eight years as President Barack Obama’s No. 2, is an early glimpse of the sort of attacks he is likely to face from his more liberal rivals in a race that will be heavily influenced by the party’s progressive activists. Sanders, the independent who challenged Clinton from the left during the 2016 Democratic primary, criticized Biden’s past support of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade deals that he says have cost Americans jobs. “When people take a look at my record versus Vice President Biden’s record — I helped lead the fight against NAFTA, he voted for NAFTA,” Sanders said on CNN on Monday night, adding that he also helped lead the fight against permanent normal trade relations with China, which Biden supported. “I strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership; he supported it. I voted against the war in Iraq; he voted for it,” Sanders said. “I like Joe Biden; Joe is a friend of mine,” he said. “I think what we need to do with all of the candidates is have an issue-oriented campaign, not personal attacks.” In a fundraising appeal on Tuesday, O’Rourke’s team noted Biden’s support from a super PAC, one of many outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money but are not affiliated with the campaign. “We’re trying to campaign the right way — the real way — by traveling across the country and listening to Americans, and by relying on the support of regular, everyday people chipping in what they can afford,” the O’Rourke fundraising appeal said.      Warren said at a campaign event after Biden’s entrance in the race last week that Biden had taken the side of credit card companies in a 2005 vote on a bill that made it harder for some people to file for bankruptcy. Biden, who spent more than three decades as the U.S. senator from Delaware, has long been criticized by liberals for his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in the state. Inslee, who has put his efforts to fight climate change at the forefront of his long-shot campaign for the White House, criticized O’Rourke and his climate change plan. “Beto O’Rourke will need to answer why he did not lead on climate change in Congress and why he voted on the side of oil companies to open up offshore drilling,” he said in a statement on Monday. Palmieri said the attacks were flying early in a Democratic race that will not have its first nominating contest until early February 2020 in Iowa, but that was to be expected in a historically crowded field. While Sanders has always been willing to confront those he disagrees with, she said, some other top contenders might hold off until later in the year on drawing contrasts with their opponents. “Right now, no one is fighting for their life,” she said. “Those who see themselves as more viable contenders can have some caution about picking a fight too early.” Editing by Kieran Murray and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

108,Oprah 'quietly figuring out' how to wield her political clout in 2020 - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:23 PM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, whose opinions can get millions of fans to try a new diet or turn a book into an international best-seller, is figuring out which Democratic candidate she will endorse in the crowded 2020 U.S. presidential race. Winfrey, who has ruled out running for the White House, told the Hollywood Reporter in an extensive interview released on Tuesday that she was “quietly figuring out where I’m going to use my voice in support.” “I’m sitting back, waiting to see. It’ll be very clear who I’m supporting,” she said of the 2020 election campaign. Winfrey campaigned heavily for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but adopted a lower profile in her support of Hillary Clinton, who lost in 2016 to current Republican President Donald Trump. Some 20 Democrats are running for president in 2020. Winfrey said among the Democrats she is researching are South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and California Senator Kamala Harris. She said she already knows New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Winfrey, a billionaire movie producer, television network  owner, magazine publisher and philanthropist, was urged by her supporters to run for the White House herself after delivering a  rousing speech at the 2018 Golden Globe awards ceremony. She has repeatedly ruled out the idea. Winfrey is also an actress who was Oscar-nominated for her supporting role in the 1985 film “The Color Purple.” She also had a major role in the 2018 film “A Wrinkle in Time,” and appeared in “Selma” and “The Butler” as well as the series “Greenleaf” on OWN TV, the Oprah Winfrey Network. But with a series of documentaries and interview shows lined up for the upcoming Apple TV+ streaming service, Winfrey said she was no longer interested in acting. “I think to be really, really good at it, you’ve got to do it a lot. You’ve got to work at it. And it’s got to be something that you have true passion about. I don’t think it’s something you can dabble in,” she said. “It doesn’t feed my soul anymore.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by David GregorioAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

109,Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood says it will continue 'peaceful' work regardless of Trump moves - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:36 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood said on Tuesday it would continue to work in line with “our moderate and peaceful thinking” regardless of moves by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to designate it a foreign terrorist organization.  The White House said earlier that Trump was acting following a request from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief in 2013 engineered the removal of freely elected President Mohamed Mursi, a senior Brotherhood figure, and a subsequent crackdown on its supporters.  “We will remain ... steadfast in our work in accordance with our moderate and peaceful thinking and what we believe to be right, for honest and constructive cooperation to serve the communities in which we live, and humanity as a whole,” the Brotherhood said in a statement on its official website. “The Muslim Brotherhood will remain stronger - through God’s grace and power - than any decision.” Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Brotherhood came to power in the country’s first modern free election in 2012, a year after former President Hosni Mubarak was toppled in an uprising. After Mursi was himself overthrown in 2013, the Brotherhood was swiftly banned. Egyptian authorities have declared it a terrorist organization and jailing thousands of its followers and much of its leadership, including Mursi. The Brotherhood says it is a non-violent movement and denies any relationship to violent insurgencies waged by al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

110,"FOREX-Dollar holds tight ranges, U.S.-Sino trade talks in focus - Reuters","May 7, 2019 /  1:26 AM / Updated 13 hours ago","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Daniel Leussink TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - The dollar hung near a five-week low against the yen on Tuesday after worries about U.S.-China trade tensions rekindled fears about the outlook for global growth. The greenback was relatively unchanged against most major peers, even as comments from the White House that China had moved away from trade-related commitments pushed down U.S. bond yields and stock futures. The dollar index against a basket of six rivals was basically unchanged at 97.53, having ended the previous session nearly flat. “From China’s perspective, a break up in negotiations isn’t really favourable for the domestic economy. I think they want to get a deal one way or the other,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. While there had been talk that Washington and Beijing might reach a trade deal this week, it is likely the negotiations will take a bit more time, he added. Against the yen, the dollar was a shade lower at 110.685 yen . It had brushed a five-week low of 110.285 yen per dollar during the previous session. The Japanese currency tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation. Late on Monday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China had moved away from commitments made over the course of trade negotiations. Lighthizer said his office would probably put out a notice on Tuesday about a proposed increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. Futures for the S&P 500 fell following the remarks. U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields hit their lowest since May 1. The dollar moved largely in familiar trading ranges against other units. The euro held steady at $1.1199. The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.6993 , though it still hovered near a four-month low touched during the previous session. Investors eyed Australian retail sales data for March due at 0130 GMT for trading cues, while also keeping tabs on a rate decision by Australia’s central bank later in the day. A slim majority of economists polled by Reuters expected the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep rates at a record low 1.50 percent, though calls for an easing have grown louder after disappointingly weak first-quarter inflation.

112,UPDATE 1-Occidental investor set to vote against board due to Anadarko bid - Reuters,"May 7, 2019 /  12:26 AM / in 14 hours","4 Min Read(Adds Anadarko agreed to sell itself to Occidental) By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON, May 6 (Reuters) - T. Rowe Price Group Inc said on Monday it intends to vote against the Occidental Petroleum Corp board of directors because the company will not allow shareholders to vote on its bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which T. Rowe Price and other shareholders oppose. Several other investors also said they might vote against approving Occidental’s board of directors at the annual meeting on Friday. Occidental on Sunday increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko, removing a requirement for Occidental shareholders to approve the deal. That move led Anadarko on Monday to name Occidental’s $76-a-share offer as superior to that submitted by Chevron Corp , requiring Chevron by Friday to revise its offer or walk away. “We don’t feel we have any choice,” said fund manager John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “We really struggle to understand the logic of not putting a transformational deal to your shareholder base.” T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth largest shareholder, held 21.1 million shares of the oil company as of Dec. 31, along with 865,000 shares of Anadarko and 8 million in Chevron, which offered $33 billion for Anadarko. Occidental risks the ire of billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has been amassing a stake in the Houston-based oil producer intending to challenge its Anadarko offer, according to sources. Icahn’s involvement throws a wild card into the merger battle, said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April. Matrix opposes the merger and may vote against the Occidental board “to send a message,” Katz said. “We don’t think they’re correctly handling their fiduciary decisions.” Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said on Monday the decision to increase the cash portion of the offer was designed to address Anadarko’s need for greater certainty the deal would go ahead. “Our objective in doing this was not at all to avoid a shareholder vote. It was to ensure we had a reasonable chance to make this happen,” she said on a conference call on Monday. “We weren’t at all on a level playing field,” she said, noting that the Anadarko board had failed for days to make a decision. It has “been a 12-day process” and “our proposal still wasn’t deemed superior, which is why we’ve yesterday submitted the increased cash offer,” Hollub said. Occidental’s bid includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway would receive preferred shares paying an 8 percent dividend. “Occidental putting in more cash is really a ploy to not have a shareholder vote,” said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at South Texas Money Management, which holds shares of Chevron and Occidental. “That’s upsetting from an investor point of view.” Ledoux opposes the merger, fearing that Occidental would go into the next oil price downturn with a debt-laden balance sheet. He has not decided how his company will vote on the Occidental proxy. It will wait to see what else develops and whether Icahn takes a stand, Ledoux said. “I would imagine there’s going to be a lot of votes against (the board) as a protest,” Ledoux said.

115,"Japan's SoftBank set for small profit rise, Vision Fund IPO plans eyed - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  11:01 PM / Updated 15 hours ago","4 Min Read* Analysts expect Q4 profit of 156 bln yen, up 1 pct y/y * Comes as some Vision Fund portfolio firms prepare for IPOs * SoftBank mulling IPO of $100 bln Vision Fund -source By Sam Nussey TOKYO, May 7 (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is expected to report a small rise in its fourth-quarter profit, while investors look for details on whether the conglomerate plans to monetise its almost $100 billion Vision Fund through an IPO. SoftBank is considering taking the Saudi-backed investment fund public, a source said on Friday, adding that no formal process has been started. Following the listing of the group’s domestic telco SoftBank Corp in December, the Vision Fund is the largest segment in SoftBank’s earnings without a market valuation. It is, however, unclear how the world’s largest technology investment fund could be listed in its current form. SoftBank is expected to post on Thursday a 1 percent rise in operating profit to 156 billion yen ($1.41 billion) for the three months ended March, an average estimate of three analysts polled by Refinitiv shows. SoftBank has not provided a forecast and moved to new accounting standards this financial year. The results come at a potential inflection point for the group and the Vision Fund as portfolio companies like Uber Technologies and the owner of WeWork, The We Company, prepare to list, putting a price tag on some of the conglomerate’s largest bets on unlisted startups. With investors struggling to quantify Vision Fund’s growing investments amid a lack of clarity over its valuation methods, analysts think the listings could help underscore its strategy. Uber is set to price its $10 billion IPO on May 9, seeking a valuation of up to $90 billion. That is lower than what Uber insiders had hoped for, but investors have reported strong demand for the shares. The lower valuation comes after rival Lyft Inc’s poor stock performance after its market debut. That reflects investor scepticism over Lyft’s path to profitability, with peers likes Uber and WeWork also heavily losing money. In China, Sequoia Capital China, viewed as a bellwether for tech investment, is set to lay off as much as 20 percent of investment staff as a slowdown in the tech sector saps appetite for risk, two people have said. While the Vision Fund has previously profitably exited its stakes in Indian online retailer FlipKart, which it sold to Walmart, and in already-public chipmaker Nvidia Corp , Uber will be its first portfolio company to go public. SoftBank’s rapidly growing investments continue to cause investor headaches in valuing the business, while also raising concerns about returns and SoftBank’s indebtedness. Last week, a newly created Latin America-focused fund under SoftBank Group COO Marcelo Claure made its first move after SoftBank announced a $1 billion investment in Colombian delivery app Rappi. SoftBank Group’s domestic telco reports its financial results a day ahead of its parent. Three analysts on average see a weak end to SoftBank Corp’s year, with operating profit set to fall 11 percent to 94 billion yen. While the telco hopes a series of joint ventures with SoftBank portfolio companies will help drive growth, pressure on carrier fees have left many investors in wait-and-see mode. Sprint Corp, a SoftBank unit, and T-Mobile US Inc last month extended the deadline for completing their $26 billion merger, as regulators have yet to decide whether to approve the transaction announced a year ago. SoftBank Group’s shares have risen almost 60 percent this year, but the telco’s shares are down 3 percent and languish 12.5 percent below their December 1,500 yen IPO price. Japan’s financial markets, closed for extended “Golden Week” national holidays, will reopen on Tuesday. ($1 = 110.7400 yen) Reporting by Sam Nussey; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Himani

116,Wall St. falls as White House vows to raise China tariffs - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:37 AM / Updated 16 hours ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday after President Donald Trump pledged to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, though Wall Street finished well off its session lows as some investors saw Trump’s comments as a bargaining tactic and expressed confidence in an eventual trade agreement. After the closing bell, however, equity index futures took a fresh hit after senior U.S. trade officials said China had reneged on its previous commitments and the tone of negotiations had soured. S&P e-minis were last down 0.60% after resuming trading for the overnight session, a signal that investors expect the market to open lower on Tuesday.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the Trump administration would “probably” publish a notice on Tuesday about plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. In a surprise tweet on Sunday, Trump said the higher levies would go into effect on Friday if no deal with China was sealed. His comments triggered a global sell-off in stocks and inflamed fears of a slowdown in global growth, fears which have periodically roiled markets over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500 fell as much as 1.6% during the session while U.S. Treasury yields dropped as investors turned to low-risk government bonds. Yet the major indexes recovered much of their losses in afternoon trading as some investors remained hopeful that a trade agreement would soon be reached. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.45%. “It seems like a negotiating stance,” said David Lefkowitz, senior Americas equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment office in New York. “Our base case still is that China and the United States do find common ground. “The probability that there is a negative outcome has probably gone up a little bit, but quantifying that, it’s hard to say,” he added. A rise in healthcare shares helped offset the trade-driven losses. At the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday, Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins said he favored the sector. The sector got a further lift as Centene Corp shares rose 6.6% after Reuters reported that two hedge funds have built stakes in the health insurer and are exploring a challenge to its planned acquisition of WellCare Health Plans Inc. But materials, industrials and technology shares dropped as investors moved away from cyclical and trade-sensitive sectors. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.3%. Chipmakers, which get a sizable portion of their revenue from China, also tumbled. The Philadelphia chip index slid 1.7%. Apple Inc shares, which have also been sensitive to signs of weakness in China, declined 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.47 points, or 0.25%, to 26,438.48, the S&P 500 lost 13.17 points, or 0.45%, to 2,932.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.71 points, or 0.5%, to 8,123.29. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp shares rose 3.8% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a need for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed-upon $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Shares of Chevron rose 1.0%.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

117,Gundlach recommends buying rate volatility on long maturity U.S. Treasuries: Sohn - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:58 PM / Updated 16 hours ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, said on Monday at the Sohn Investment Conference that his best idea for investors is to buy interest rate volatility on long maturity U.S. Treasuries.  Gundlach, known as Wall Street’s Bond King, said U.S. interest rates “cannot maintain the low volatility” they have experienced in the past eight years and it is “not inconceivable” that interest-rate volatility could double. Investors can express the bet through both put and call options at the same strike, or sale, price, he said. Puts give investors the ability to buy, while calls provide the chance to sell. Landing a number where the rate rises or falls more than the total premium on the option could allow investors to book big profits.  Gundlach recommended using the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF as a way to execute the trade. “I think this is an extremely compelling time to do this trade and an extremely important environment where outcomes are so binary,” he said.

118,Illinois credit quality could improve with graduated tax rates -Moody's - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:01 PM / in 17 hours","2 Min ReadCHICAGO, May 6 (Reuters) - Illinois’ relatively weak credit quality could get a boost if the state adopts a graduated income tax rate system, which provides increased revenue-raising flexibility to address pension and budget pressures, Moody’s Investors Service said on Monday. Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker has championed the move as a way to tackle the state’s fiscal woes. The credit rating agency, which rates Illinois a notch above junk at Baa3, acknowledged that switching from the current flat income tax rate to rates that rise with income is “a politically difficult process.” That process requires the placement of a constitutional amendment on the ballot by a three-fifths majority vote of the state House, as well as the Senate, which approved the measure last week. If passed by the Democrat-controlled House, which has not indicated when it will take up the amendment, voters would then decide the amendment’s fate in November 2020. Illinois has the lowest credit ratings among U.S. states due to a $133.5 billion unfunded pension liability and a chronic structural budget deficit. “A positive outcome for the state’s credit standing would require that the new system yield substantial net new revenue, without material damage to the economy, and the new revenue be largely allocated to addressing the state’s retirement benefit liabilities on a recurring basis,” Moody’s analyst Ted Hampton said in a statement. Pritzker has said Illinois could gain $3.4 billion annually from  graduated tax rates. Only $200 million of the new revenue would be allocated to pensions annually, under a plan his administration unveiled in February. Moody’s said while a graduated tax rate system would give Illinois more flexibility to raise revenue, it would also expose state income tax collections to volatility in the financial market, which drives high income earners’ tax payments.

120,Foxconn chairman travels to White House to discuss Wisconsin: source - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  10:35 AM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - The chairman of Apple supplier Foxconn will travel to the United States on Tuesday for a meeting in the White House that is believed to be related to an investment in Wisconsin, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Foxconn said this month it remains committed to its contract to build a display plant and tech research facilities in Wisconsin, days after the U.S. state’s governor said he wanted to renegotiate the deal.  In January, Reuters reported that Foxconn is reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus, and said it intends to hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than the manufacturing workforce the project originally promised. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple Inc, has pledged to eventually create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, but said this year it had slowed its pace of hiring. The source said it wasn’t yet clear if Gou would meet U.S. President Donald Trump. No further details were given. A spokesman for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the formal name of Foxconn, said the firm wouldn’t comment on the chairman’s itinerary. Gou, 69, said recently that he would step back from the helm of Foxconn, which is a major supplier for a slew of electronic giants including Apple, to try for a run at becoming Taiwan’s next president in an election next January. Gou, who owns 9.4 percent of Foxconn as its top shareholder, is Taiwan’s richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.  Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.

121,Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block House subpoenas - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:45 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and seven of his companies filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp to block the banks from complying with federal subpoenas investigating his financial dealings. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court’s Southern District of New York, contended that demands for records by Democrat-controlled House committees have no legitimate or lawful purpose. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the lawsuit said. It also complains that the Democrats are hoping “they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, both Democrats, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, the New York Times and other media reported. On April 15, two U.S. House of Representatives committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Both banks have been involved in Trump’s real estate empire. “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates, as thoroughly as possible,” Waters, said in a statement earlier. Schiff said previously in a statement the subpoenas issued included a “friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank.” Trump recently has said that he intends to defy any efforts from the Democrats to dig into his affairs. Among other things, the Democrats have been looking into possible dealings Trump might have with Russia. The suit, which includes The Trump Organization Inc. and Trump’s three eldest children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, states that the court has the power to declare the subpoenas invalid. A representative of Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Attorneys and representatives for the two sides were not immediately available to Reuters late Monday.

122,"Explainer: Probes spawned by Mueller target Trump business, others - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:03 AM / 7 days ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Numerous investigations spun out of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe are still alive and kicking, presenting potential ongoing legal and political risk for President Donald Trump, some of his former advisers and others. Even though Trump avoided a knockout blow from the April 18 Mueller report, the special counsel disclosed more than a dozen  active criminal inquiries that will play out for months to come, some possibly into the 2020 election campaign season. Details on most of these cases are unclear as they were redacted in the 448-page report. Only two were not blacked out: one case versus former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen; and one versus Greg Craig, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration. The following are some of the topics likely being examined in spun-off probes by federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating the spending and fundraising of Trump’s inaugural committee. They are also probing the Trump Organization’s role in payments made to silence two women about alleged sexual encounters with Trump before the 2016 election. Both probes emanated from the Cohen case. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to his role in the hush-money payments. Prosecutors effectively named Trump an unindicted co-conspirator in the scheme, which they say was aimed at influencing the election in violation of campaign finance laws. Trump has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing. In February public testimony, Cohen gave Congress copies of checks signed by Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, reimbursing Cohen for the payments. The Mueller report shows Cohen, slated to start a three-year prison sentence on May 6, was interviewed by federal authorities as recently as March 19 on topics ranging from negotiations during the campaign about building a Trump tower in Moscow to talks concerning a potential presidential pardon for Cohen. A Mueller probe mystery is why prosecutors in late 2018 sent right-wing author Jerome Corsi a draft plea agreement. It asked him to admit to lying to investigators about his communications with Trump adviser Roger Stone on WikiLeaks. Prosecutors never followed through on the threat to charge Corsi. Corsi, who said he rejected the plea offer and maintains his innocence, told Reuters on Friday he was confident he would not be charged. If he is not, he would avoid the fate of Stone, who was indicted by Mueller in January for allegedly lying to Congress about his pursuit of information on stolen Democratic Party emails that were made public by Russia and Wikileaks. Stone, who was not charged with conspiring with Russians or WikiLeaks, pleaded not guilty and is preparing for trial. Mueller’s report blacked out significant passages related to WikiLeaks, perhaps indicating that WikiLeaks or its founder Julian Assange are under ongoing scrutiny related to dissemination of emails during the 2016 election. Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors unsealed charges against Assange alleging he conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 to gain access to a U.S. government network used for classified documents. The U.S. is seeking Assange’s extradition from London. Mueller’s investigation ensnared several people for failing to register with the Justice Department as foreign agents. Among them were Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, formerly Trump’s campaign chairman and deputy chairman, for their lobbying work in the United States for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. These cases reflected a new Justice Department focus on the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires people advocating on behalf of a foreign power to disclose that work. Craig’s case involves one of the Ukrainian-related projects that formed the basis of Mueller’s probe of Manafort. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also examining prominent Washington lobbyists Vin Weber and Tony Podesta for Ukrainian-related work directed by Manafort. Congressional committees probing Russia’s 2016 election meddling encouraged Mueller to look at the veracity of the past testimony of witnesses.  Mueller already charged Stone and Cohen with lying to Congress. It is possible that other potential cases have been referred elsewhere in the Justice Department. For instance, the Mueller report showed that Erik Prince, founder of the now defunct security firm Blackwater USA and a Trump supporter, may have misled Congress on details of contact he had with a Russian banker in January 2017.

The bank also said that Philip Berlinski and Jeff Nedelman were being named co-chief operating officers of global equities with Michael Daffey. The three will jointly lead global equities. Berlinski had been Levine’s co-head overseeing global equities trades and execution services, and Nedelman had been the global head of prime services. Goldman routinely names multiple co-heads of its business units, and the memos announcing Monday’s leadership changes were signed by all three co-heads of the securities business, Ashok Varadhan, R. Martin Chavez and Jim Esposito. “Brian has played a critical role in developing the firm’s leadership position in equities trading,” they wrote of the outgoing Levine. “He has helped build systematic trading platforms that will benefit our clients for years to come.” Levine joined the bank’s shares trading desk 25 years ago. He went on to play key roles helping the bank become a market leader in program trading and handled risk management of some of the bank’s most important “capital markets blocks over the past decade,” according to the note.

But stock futures dropped sharply following the market close after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China had moved away from commitments made over the course of trade negotiations. S&P e-minis were last down 1.3%. U.S. negotiators are now recommending an increase in tariffs on Chinese goods if a trade agreement is not reached by Friday. Lighthizer said his office would likely post a notice on Tuesday about the planned increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. On Sunday, Trump had said an increase in the tariffs would go into effect, reversing a decision he made in February to retain the tariffs at 10% as the United States and China made progress on trade talks. China said on Monday that a delegation was still preparing to go to the United States, but did not mention if Vice Premier Liu He, its lead official in the negotiations, would be part of the team as originally planned. Trump’s comments inflamed fears of a slowdown in global growth, which have periodically roiled markets over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500 fell as much as 1.6% during the session while U.S. Treasury yields dropped as investors turned to low-risk government bonds. Yet the major indexes recovered much of their losses in afternoon trading as some investors remained hopeful that a trade agreement would soon be reached. “It seems like a negotiating stance,” said David Lefkowitz, senior Americas equity strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management’s chief investment office in New York. “Our base case still is that China and the United States do find common ground. “The probability that there is a negative outcome has probably gone up a little bit, but quantifying that, it’s hard to say,” he added. A rise in healthcare shares helped offset the trade-driven losses. At the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday, Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins said he favored the sector. The sector got a further lift as Centene Corp shares rose 6.6% after Reuters reported that two hedge funds have built stakes in the health insurer and are exploring a challenge to its planned acquisition of WellCare Health Plans Inc. But materials, industrials and technology shares dropped as investors moved away from cyclical and trade-sensitive sectors. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.3%. Chipmakers, which get a sizable portion of their revenue from China, also tumbled. The Philadelphia chip index slid 1.7%. Apple Inc shares, which have also been sensitive to signs of weakness in China, declined 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.47 points, or 0.25%, to 26,438.48, the S&P 500 lost 13.17 points, or 0.45%, to 2,932.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.71 points, or 0.5%, to 8,123.29. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp shares rose 3.8% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a need for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed-upon $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Shares of Chevron rose 1.0%. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

He said China had retreated from specific commitments, a move that would have led to substantive changes in the text of the deal. “That in our view is unacceptable,” he said. A delegation from China will be in Washington on Thursday and Friday and Lighthizer said he expected top Chinese negotiator Vice Premier Liu He will attend. Trump wants to see a deal with substantial structural changes but that is not where the two sides are at the moment, Lighthizer said as he and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin briefed reporters. Lighthizer said the Chinese pulled back on some commitments reached in the talks over the last week or so and that was what precipitated Trump’s tweet on Sunday promising to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week. Mnuchin said it would be unfortunate if the two sides, the world’s biggest economies, could not conclude an agreement and they had hoped to conclude a deal by the end of the week. If they hear something different from the Chinese this week, Mnuchin said, they will report that to Trump.

126,Occidental investor set to vote against board due to Anadarko bid - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:32 PM / Updated 14 hours ago","4 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - T. Rowe Price Group Inc said on Monday it intends to vote against the Occidental Petroleum Corp board of directors because the company will not allow shareholders to vote on its bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which T. Rowe Price and other shareholders oppose. Several other investors also said they might vote against approving Occidental’s board of directors at the annual meeting on Friday. Occidental on Sunday increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko, removing a requirement for Occidental shareholders to approve the deal. That move led Anadarko on Monday to name Occidental’s $76-a-share offer as superior to that submitted by Chevron Corp, requiring Chevron by Friday to revise its offer or walk away.   “We don’t feel we have any choice,” said fund manager John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “We really struggle to understand the logic of not putting a transformational deal to your shareholder base.” T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth largest shareholder, held 21.1 million shares of the oil company as of Dec. 31, along with 865,000 shares of Anadarko and 8 million in Chevron, which offered $33 billion for Anadarko. Occidental risks the ire of billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has been amassing a stake in the Houston-based oil producer intending to challenge its Anadarko offer, according to sources. Icahn’s involvement throws a wild card into the merger battle, said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April.  Matrix opposes the merger and may vote against the Occidental board “to send a message,” Katz said. “We don’t think they’re correctly handling their fiduciary decisions.” Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said on Monday the decision to increase the cash portion of the offer was designed to address Anadarko’s need for greater certainty the deal would go ahead. “Our objective in doing this was not at all to avoid a shareholder vote. It was to ensure we had a reasonable chance to make this happen,” she said on a conference call on Monday. “We weren’t at all on a level playing field,” she said, noting that the Anadarko board had failed for days to make a decision.   It has “been a 12-day process” and “our proposal still wasn’t deemed superior, which is why we’ve yesterday submitted the increased cash offer,” Hollub said. Occidental’s bid includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway would receive preferred shares paying an 8 percent dividend.  “Occidental putting in more cash is really a ploy to not have a shareholder vote,” said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at South Texas Money Management, which holds shares of Chevron and Occidental. “That’s upsetting from an investor point of view.” Ledoux opposes the merger, fearing that Occidental would go into the next oil price downturn with a debt-laden balance sheet. He has not decided how his company will vote on the Occidental proxy. It will wait to see what else develops and whether Icahn takes a stand, Ledoux said.  “I would imagine there’s going to be a lot of votes against (the board) as a protest,” Ledoux said.

131,WRAPUP 2-Trump tariff hike leaves U.S.-China trade deal in limbo as markets fall - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  6:15 PM / Updated 18 hours ago","6 Min Read(Adds source comments on China) By David Lawder and Ben Blanchard WASHINGTON/BEIJING, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to increase tariffs on Chinese goods left prospects for a deal to end a trade war between the world’s two largest economies in limbo on Monday, casting uncertainty on plans for more talks this week. Stocks around the world tumbled and oil prices hit a one-month low after Trump tweeted on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent by the end of the week, and would “soon” target the remaining Chinese imports with tariffs. The announcement abruptly ended a five-month truce in a trade war that has cost the two countries billions of dollars, slowed global growth and disrupted manufacturing supply chains and U.S. farm exports. Trump’s comments on Sunday came as a surprise after he and members of his team had repeatedly said the two sides were making progress on a deal. His shift in tone came after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told him that Chinese negotiators had pulled back from some prior commitments in talks last week in Beijing, people familiar with the talks said. Specifically, the Chinese side was seeking to deal with any policy changes through administrative and regulatory actions, not through changes to Chinese law as previously agreed, one person with knowledge of the talks said. “It undermines the core architecture of the deal,” the person said, adding that not codifying the concessions would make it difficult to verify and enforce China’s compliance. Speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the talks, the person said that under China’s system in which the Communist Party has ultimate control, changes in law are the only way to get even a small measure of certainty. Another source familiar with the situation said Trump had reiterated to advisers in recent days that he would walk away from a trade deal with China if it was not strong enough. This person said that there was “irrational exuberance” about the talks and Trump’s move “shouldn’t be that big of a shock” as the president had originally planned to raise tariffs on Chinese goods in January. It was unclear on Monday whether Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would travel as planned to Washington for talks scheduled to start on Wednesday — negotiations that some had viewed as potentially leading to a deal announcement. A Chinese delegation was still preparing to go to the United States for trade talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said earlier on Monday in Beijing, without saying whether Liu would be part of it. Queries about the talks to China’s embassy in Washington were not answered. “The atmosphere of the negotiations has changed,” said a Chinese official with knowledge of the talks, and how they would proceed was being re-evaluated. “All that depends on the attitude of the United States,” the official said. A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s office did not immediately respond to a query about the status of the talks in Washington and Liu’s attendance. The United States is demanding sweeping changes to China’s economic policies, including better protection of U.S. intellectual property, ending forced technology transfers and cyber theft of American trade secrets. Washington also wants more access to China’s vast markets for U.S. companies, curbs on industrial subsidies and increased purchases of American products. Trump appeared to defend his decision in a tweet early on Monday, lashing out over the U.S. trade deficit with China. He also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on trade in a “very good conversation.” “With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we’re not going to be doing that anymore!” Trump tweeted. The United States imported about $539.5 billion in goods from China in 2018 and exported $120.3 billion, for a record trade deficit of $419.2 billion, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Trump also has said that China was paying U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, but in reality, mostly U.S. companies importing the goods pay the tariffs. See EXPLAINER, and FACTBOX on Trump’s tariff actions On Monday, billionaire investor Warren Buffett warned that a wider trade war between the world’s two largest economies would be bad for the world economy and for his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway A full-scale trade war is unlikely, he said, but “would be bad for everything Berkshire owns.”. Chinese news outlets have been told not to independently report on Trump’s tweets, and instead adhere to any report from the official Xinhua news agency, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets.” Trump currently has 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese machinery and technology goods, and 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of products ranging from computer modems and routers to furniture, lighting and building materials. Negotiations on removing punitive U.S. tariffs has been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be removed, while Trump wants to keep some, if not all, as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.

132,UPDATE 2-Argentina industrial output slides as growth hopes flicker - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:41 PM / in 18 hours","2 Min Read(Adds analyst comment, details on job losses) By Jorge Iorio and Adam Jourdan BUENOS AIRES, May 6 (Reuters) - Argentina’s industrial output slid a steeper-than-expected 13.4 percent in March compared with the same month last year, the government’s Indec statistics agency said on Monday, as the recession-hit economy struggles to return to growth. The fall in output, an early indicator of growth data, was the 11th straight month of declines since the middle of last year when South America’s No. 2 economy was hit by a debt crisis, steep inflation and a tumbling peso currency. Argentine President Mauricio Macri is battling to revive growth ahead of what is expected to be a knife-edge presidential election in October, where the state of the economy will play a central role in whether he can fend off a rising political challenge. The country’s economy has remained sluggish, however, despite hopes that growth would start to turn around as the year progressed, with high interest rates and stubborn inflation sapping economic activity. Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos said in a note following the data that political uncertainty, weakening consumer sentiment and tight domestic financial conditions were damaging any “green shoots” of economic recovery. “Even higher inflation and a deeper and longer recession are political liabilities for an incumbent facing voters whose top concerns are precisely inflation and growth/employment,” he said, adding prices would keep rising fast for now. Inflation is running at an annual rate of close to 55 percent, hitting savings, while job losses are starting to mount, with employment down by around 250,000 jobs over the last year, according to data released last month. Industrial output dropped 8.5 percent in February after falls of 10.8 percent in January and 14.7 percent the month before. Analysts had predicted a 9.5 percent drop in March.

133,Attorney general balks at closed-door testimony on Mueller findings - Reuters,"April 28, 2019 /  6:25 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr objects to testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in a closed session dedicated to redacted portions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report, a congressional Democratic aide said on Sunday. Barr is threatening to skip his planned appearance on Thursday, the aide told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The committee’s chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler, has proposed that Barr’s public testimony be followed by a second round of questioning, where sensitive matters would be discussed behind closed doors and include committee staff lawyers, a House Democratic aide told Reuters.  Barr opposes both stipulations, according to the aide. The attorney general is also scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately return calls for comment. The attorney general, a Trump appointee, released a redacted version on April 18 of Mueller’s report on the 22-month investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. The report here detailed a series of actions by Trump to impede the probe, but did not make a conclusion on whether those actions constituted the crime of obstruction. It also concluded that Trump and his campaign had not engaged in criminal conspiracy with Moscow. Nadler has subpoenaed the Justice Department for the full report.     The House of Representatives panel’s Republicans sided with Barr, saying Democrats’ demands were unreasonable. “Democrats have yet to prove their demands anything but abusive and illogical in light of the transparency and good faith the attorney general has shown our committee,” they said in a statement. The Democratic aide said there was precedent for committee staff to question Cabinet-level officials and Senate-confirmed officials, citing political scandals including the Watergate break-in of the 1970s and the Iran-Contra scandal of 1987.

134,U.S. should pay North Korea hospital bill for student prisoner who died: ex-envoy - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:13 PM / in 8 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former U.S. diplomat who secured the release from North Korea of American Otto Warmbier said on Monday Washington should honor its pledge to pay Pyongyang $2 million for the student’s hospital care. Joseph Yun, the former U.S. special envoy for North Korea, confirmed to Reuters he had signed an agreement with the North Koreans for the payment of the money before Warmbier was flown out of Pyongyang in a coma on June 13, 2017.  He died days after returning home.  White House national security adviser John Bolton said in a television interview on Sunday that while the agreement had been signed, no payment had been made to the North Koreans. Yun, who retired from the State Department last year and is now a global affairs analyst for CNN, said on the network he believed the United States should honor its commitment. “My view is, yes. If you’ve signed, if you promised another government from the U.S. government that you would make the payment, my view certainly is that we should go ahead and meet our end of the commitment,” he said. Yun said that as soon as North Korea made the demand he contacted the then secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, who told him to go ahead and sign the agreement. Asked if he believed Tillerson had the approval of President Donald Trump, he replied: “That was my understanding. I never asked him. But that was my understanding.” The Washington Post reported last Thursday that Trump had approved payment of the $2 million bill from Pyongyang to cover its care of Warmbier, who was detained in North Korea for 17 months. In a reply on Twitter, Trump said “no money was paid” but did not address whether any agreement had been made.  Warmbier died in the United States six days after his release from North Korea. An Ohio coroner said he died from a lack of oxygen and blood to his brain. North Korea has dismissed claims that it tortured the student and blamed food poisoning and a sleeping pill.     North Korea state media said Warmbier, a University of Virginia student visiting North Korea, was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel.

136,"Global stocks, yields ease losses on skepticism of Trump's China threats - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  12:36 AM / Updated 18 hours ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street’s indexes and bond yields ended down but well above their session lows while oil futures settled higher as investors bet that U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to raise tariffs on China would not materialize. Trump tweeted on Sunday that the United States would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week, causing investors to seek safety and flee from risky assets. On Monday, Trump sharply criticized China.   But as Monday’s session wore on, the initial shock from the threats appeared to wear off. U.S. Treasury yields pared some of their declines. Oil futures reversed course to settle slightly higher after a volatile day as rising tensions between the United States and Iran helped buoy prices. The futures had earlier touched a one-month low due to Trump’s tweets. [O/R]  In stocks, the S&P 500 closed down 0.4% after falling as much as 1.6% during the session.   “Investors are warming up to the idea that its more of a negotiation tactic than it is a petulant child screaming bloody murder,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. Fears about trade war escalation were also calmed somewhat by a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Monday that a Chinese delegation was still preparing to go to United States for trade talks. “Right now the contingent from China is still coming. If that changes, then the market narrative and the market reaction might also change,” said Nolte.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.47 points, or 0.25%, to 26,438.48, the S&P 500 lost 13.17 points, or 0.45%, to 2,932.47 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 40.71 points, or 0.5%, to 8,123.29. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.88% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.65%. In comparison, the Shanghai SE Composite had closed up 5.6% in its biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016.  The U.S. dollar slipped to a five-week low against the yen and fell versus other currencies on Monday after Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week, risking the derailment of the trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Volume, though, was thin overall with London and Tokyo markets closed for holidays. The dollar weakened 0.30% versus the yen to 110.89 per dollar. The dollar index  rose 0.01%, with the euro unchanged at $1.12. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.4998%, from 2.53% late on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled up 31 cents, or 0.5%, at $62.25 a barrel. Brent crude futures settled up 39 cents, or 0.55%, at $71.24 a barrel.

The bank also said that Philip Berlinski and Jeff Nedelman were being named co-chief operating officers of global equities with Michael Daffey. The three will jointly lead global equities. Berlinski had been Levine’s co-head overseeing global equities trades and execution services, and Nedelman had been the global head of prime services.  Goldman routinely names multiple co-heads of its business units, and the memos announcing Monday’s leadership changes were signed by all three co-heads of the securities business, Ashok Varadhan, R.

He went on to play key roles helping the bank become a market leader in program trading and handled risk management of some of the bank’s most important “capital markets blocks over the past decade,” according to the note.

139,Puerto Rico oversight board gets 60-day court extension for reappointments - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  8:21 PM / Updated 18 hours ago","3 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. Appeals Court on Monday gave Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board another 60 days to allow for the constitutional reappointment of its members by President Donald Trump and the Senate.  The board had faced a May 16 deadline set by the Boston-based First Circuit court on Feb. 15 to be validly reappointed or replaced after creditors of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth successfully challenged members’ appointments on constitutional grounds. Last week, the White House announced the U.S. Senate will be asked to confirm the board’s current seven members. The appeals court’s order sets a July 15 deadline for that process to be completed. Both moves allow the board to continue to restructure Puerto Rico’s roughly $120 billion of debt and pension obligations under a form of bankruptcy filed two years ago in federal court. However, the board’s executive director, Natalie Jaresko,  told reporters on Monday the two-month extension may not be sufficient as the Senate confirmation process could take longer. The appeals court denied the board’s request to stay its ruling in the case until there is a final decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The board last month petitioned the high court over the ruling, which determined the board had been unconstitutionally appointed because its members are principal U.S. officers and should have been selected by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate.”  Under the 2016 federal PROMESA law, then-President Barack Obama appointed six board members from lists of candidates recommended by Congress, as well as a seventh member in a process that did not require Senate confirmation. The lawsuit over the board members filed by creditors, including Aurelius Investment LLC and bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, also sought a dismissal of Puerto Rico’s Title III bankruptcy cases - a move the appeals court rejected. Deals restructuring the island’s sales tax-backed bonds and Government Development Bank debt have won court approval. An agreement over Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority debt was announced on Friday. According to Jaresko, the board’s recent lawsuits against government vendors, banks and bondholders will not delay the filing of a plan of adjustment for the commonwealth’s core debt, which includes its pension liabilities. She said a plan will be filed in court “as soon as reasonably possible.”  Meanwhile, the commonwealth finally released a fiscal 2016 financial audit that showed a government-wide net deficit grew to nearly $70.3 billion from $67.8 billion in fiscal 2015.

140,"Healthcare, bullish bets dominate hedge-fund Sohn Investment Conference picks - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  7:04 PM / Updated 19 hours ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - Big-name hedge fund managers, including David Einhorn and Larry Robbins, pitched stock ideas ranging from airplane lessors to biotech companies that are working to extend the human lifespan at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York on Monday. Greenlight Capital’s Einhorn, who made his name pitching a timely short of Lehman Brothers before the 2008 global financial crisis, announced a long position in airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and a short position in rail car leasing company GATX Corp, which he said has higher maintenance costs and less visibility into future revenues but trades at higher multiples than AerCap.  “We think the market has this wrong,” he said.  Einhorn, who has been a prominent critic of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc, started his 15-minute presentation by silently showing several slides of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and his bullish pronouncements for the company before calling it “a lot of horseshit.”  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital LLC, meanwhile, reiterated his long positions in HMOs such as Cigna Corp, whose shares have fallen on concerns about progressive Democratic candidates endorsing so-called “Medicare for all” plans ahead of the 2020 elections. He also remained bullish on hospitals overall.  “Hospitals are not under attack, hospitals are a wonderful place to invest,” he said.  The wide range of investment ideas reflected the challenge for portfolio managers to find undervalued assets at a time when global stock markets are near record highs.  The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 hit two record highs last week and is up 17 percent year-to-date, thanks in large part to an expanding economy and the Federal Reserve’s surprising decision in January to pause its interest rate hikes. The average hedge fund was up 5.7 percent in the first quarter, the best start to a year since 2006, according to industry publication Hedge Fund Research.  Not all the investment ideas were bullish. Ryan Heslop, portfolio manager of Firefly Value Partners LP, announced a short position in rural hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc, which he said will likely go bankrupt over the next few years as its revenue per hospital bed shrinks and its debt costs increase.  The company’s “pile of debt and the declining profitability of hospitals make it almost certain that this patient will die,” he said.  Community Health did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Spencer Glendon, founder of Probable Futures, said increasing global temperatures and more severe storms due to the effects of climate change will undercut the economy of Florida and its housing market.  As a result, he is short Floridian mortgage-backed securities, Florida municipal bonds, and banks with high exposures to the state. “When the Florida housing market falters, everything will go with it ... they are utterly dependent on real estate,” he said.  Laura Deming, managing director of the Longevity Fund, announced positions in biotech companies such as Precision BioSciences Inc, ALX Oncology and Navitor Pharmaceuticals that are working to extend the human lifespan by targeting specific cells and biological processes.  “Shouldn’t we get to choose in some way what number we get to live to?” she said.

141,"UPDATE 2-Bank of Canada says housing solid, says more mortgage flexibility would boost economy - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  6:06 PM / Updated 18 hours ago","3 Min Read(Adds quotes from central bank governor) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, May 6 (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on Monday said the housing sector was solid despite a series of challenges and called for a more flexible mortgage market to help make the country’s financial system safer. The central bank has kept interest rates on hold for six months as it studies reasons for a recent economic slowdown. These include the effects of previous hikes on the housing market, tougher mortgage rules and measures introduced to cut speculation in the major cities of Toronto and Vancouver. “The market will bottom out and will begin to perform more normally relative to fundamentals and, by the way, the fundamentals are really strong ... population and job growth are really strong,” Poloz told a news conference after making a speech in Winnipeg. He made no mention of interest rate policy. Canada’s central bank raised rates five times since July 2017 but has remained on the sidelines in its last four decisions, including on April 24 when it removed wording around the need for future hikes. The mortgage system was working well but could benefit from an imaginative approach, Poloz suggested in his speech, such as encouraging more people to take out longer fixed-rate mortgages. He said 45 percent of all mortgage loans had a fixed rate and a five-year term. Just 2 percent of all mortgage loans issued in 2018 were fixed-rate loans with a term of longer than five years. Longer terms mean consumers face the risk of having to renew at higher rates less often and also can build up more equity in their homes between renewals. “I can see how longer-term mortgages can contribute to a safer financial system and more stable economy,” he said. Homeowners cannot buy mortgage insurance for houses that cost more than C$1 million ($746,000) or if they are buying a second property. Poloz also said it could be helpful to develop a private market for mortgage-backed securities which could be a more flexible source of long-term funding for uninsured mortgages. “Of course, (there would) be a risk premium relative to non-risky bonds but not a gigantic one,” he told reporters. “That means the company floating that bond can offer a mortgage to you or me in the uninsured space ... at a reasonable price.” Poloz noted transparency would be important, given that mortgage-backed securities were at the heart of the subprime debacle that preceded the 2008 financial crisis.

143,Turkey to re-run Istanbul election lost by Erdogan's AKP - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:00 PM / in 8 hours","5 Min ReadANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish authorities on Monday scrapped the result of a vote for Istanbul mayor lost by President Tayyip Erdogan’s candidate, responding to calls by his AK Party for a re-run, in a move that hit the lira and drew opposition accusations of “dictatorship.” The High Election Board ruled that a fresh Istanbul mayoral contest will be held on June 23. The AK Party representative on the board, Recep Ozel, said the decision was based on unsigned results documents from the March 31 election and on some ballot box officials not being civil servants.  Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), which narrowly won the mayor’s office in the country’s largest city, called the ruling a “plain dictatorship.” Kati Piri, the European Parliament’s Turkey rapporteur, said the decision “ends the credibility of democratic transition of power through elections” in the country.  Reuters witnesses said people were banging on pots and pans in protest against the ruling in several Istanbul districts. The AKP had appealed for an election re-run after initial results and a series of recounts showed it had lost control of Istanbul for the first time in 25 years.  It was a shock loss for Erdogan, who in the 1990s served as the city’s mayor and had campaigned hard ahead of the nationwide local vote, his first electoral test since last year’s sharp currency crisis tipped the Turkish economy into recession.  The Turkish lira weakened and was at 6.1075 against the dollar at 1730 GMT, on track for its worst day in more than a month. The currency has tumbled more than 10 percent since a week before the initial election. Suspense over the ruling had left investors worried that weeks of additional campaigning would divert funds and attention from addressing economic reforms. “This is damaging for Turkey’s perception as a democracy and will leave Turkey’s economy vulnerable, given risks to macro financial stability in the period to July,” said Timothy Ash of Blue Bay Asset Management.  Inflation near 20 percent and unemployment near 15 percent drove many voters to abandon the AKP in the initial vote. Before the second vote, tensions with the United States could escalate over Turkey’s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system, which could trigger U.S. sanctions. It was unclear how the CHP and its supporters would respond to a re-run given suspicions over the YSK’s political independence from the AKP, which in recent years has centralized power in the presidency away from other institutions.  One CHP member of parliament, Mehmet Bekaroglu, said on Arti TV that the AKP pressured and threatened YSK judges with prison if they voted against a re-run. Piri of the European Parliament also said pressure was applied to re-do the elections.  “It is illegal to win against the AK Party,” CHP Deputy Chairman Onursal Adiguzel said on Twitter. “This system that overrules the will of the people and disregards the law is neither democratic, nor legitimate.”  In the capital Ankara - where the AKP also lost the mayor’s office to the CHP - police blocked the entrance to the YSK’s headquarters on Monday evening. The YSK also ruled to file a criminal complaint against those district election board officials who had appointed the ballot box officials. With its nationalist MHP allies, the AKP wanted the Istanbul results annulled and cited irregularities that affected the outcome, which put it some 13,000 votes behind CHP. On Saturday Erdogan said “it’s clear” the vote was marred by controversy and urged the YSK to “clear its name” with a re-run. Ekrem Imamoglu, the CHP mayor who officially took office after a smattering of recounts were completed across Istanbul last month, condemned the YSK for annulling the results under AKP pressure. “Shame on the YSK. They were placed under political pressure from day one,” Imamoglu told hundreds of chanting and flag-waving supporters.    Turkey held a re-run of general elections in 2015 when the AK Party failed for the first time since its founding to form a single-party government. In a repeat election, AK Party found the support to form it again. In recent weeks city prosecutors began probes into alleged irregularities and called 100 polling station workers in for questioning as suspects.

144,Court suspends Avianca Brasil bankruptcy auction of airport slots - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:48 PM / Updated 19 hours ago","2 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court on Monday suspended a bankruptcy auction set for Tuesday, in which struggling carrier Avianca Brasil hoped to raise at least $140 million by selling some of its coveted airport takeoff and landing rights, known as slots. The suspension could put further stress on Avianca Brasil, the country’s No. 4 airline, which has been operating with very little cash since filing for bankruptcy protection in December.  The airline said in a statement that it was still analyzing what it would do in response and that it had not filed an appeal as of Tuesday afternoon. It was unclear when a new auction would be scheduled. The auction would have capped an arduous process in which Avianca Brasil fought aircraft lessors for months to try to keep operating its fleet despite missed payments.  The airline’s operations have shrunk dramatically since April, when lessors won definitive rulings allowing them to  repossess planes. Its fleet is down to six aircraft, from as many as 60 Airbus SE planes late last year.  Suspension of Tuesday’s auction, first reported by newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, was requested by airport operator Swissport AG, which runs several Brazilian airports and is owed some 17 million reais ($4.3 million). Swissport and several other Avianca Brasil creditors have expressed anger at the outsize role played in the process by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management — by far the airline’s largest creditor. Under the current auction plan, much of the cash raised would cover Elliott’s debts, totaling over $400 million, and much less would go to the rest of the creditors.

145,"Fed flags high U.S. business debt, asset prices in financial report - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  7:05 PM / in 17 hours","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. stock prices are “elevated” and business debt is at historic levels, but the financial system overall “appears resilient” with low levels of leverage and less of a destabilizing run in key markets, the Federal Reserve said in its latest report on financial stability. “Investor appetite for risk appears elevated by several measures, and the debt loads of businesses are historically high,” the Fed said on Monday in a report that noted the 20 percent growth in leveraged loans between the start of last year and this year, and other aspects of corporate debt.   The ratio of debt to assets among publicly traded, nonfinancial firms is near a 20-year high, the Fed noted, and the share of new loans going to the most indebted companies is near peaks reached in 2014 and just before the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While the Fed sees the system overall as healthy, the levels of corporate debt stand out, said Fed Governor Lael Brainard. “With financial volatility easing since the end of last year, the Federal Reserve Board’s Financial Stability Report suggests stretched asset valuations and risky corporate debt merit continued vigilance against a backdrop of low-to- moderate vulnerabilities in the household and banking sectors,” Brainard said in an emailed statement. The Fed report is the central bank’s latest take on a financial system that went full circle in a matter of months, along the way prompting President Donald Trump to take aim at Fed policy and demand lower interest rates. After stock markets hit record highs early last fall, they plummeted by nearly 20 percent by year’s end, and investors began demanding higher interest rates to hold the bonds of weaker corporations. Now, stocks are back near their records and by some measures prices are high, the Fed said - the expected future price-to- earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is above its 30-year median, though well below the levels hit during the 1990s tech bubble.   Corporate credit spreads have narrowed, again focusing attention on whether investors, markets and households are taking too muted a view of economic risks. While not one of the Fed’s explicit mandates, financial stability issues are weighed as part of its policy discussions, and can shape the outcome. In the current environment, those issues provide more reason for the Fed to discount calls from the White House or elsewhere to cut rates, a step that could make riskier assets even more attractive by reducing the returns offered by safer investments like U.S. Treasury bonds. As in the last edition of its now twice-yearly report on the financial sector, the Fed cited the rapid growth of business debt and leveraged lending to corporations as a source of possible concern, noting that it could leave weaker companies stressed if the economy softens. Business debt has grown faster than the overall economy for a decade, the Fed noted, and “the elevated level of debt could leave the business sector vulnerable to a downturn in economic activity or a tightening in financial conditions.” Overall debt however, including that of households, has remained in line with the size of the economy. Among the more immediate risks cited in talks with outside contacts, the Fed noted, trade tensions and tariffs were the “preeminent” potential problem, along with slowing growth globally, political risks surrounding “Brexit,” and uncertainty around Fed policy as well.

The FBI and the Internal Revenue Service conducted the raids on Pugh’s home and Baltimore City Hall amid allegations of improper financial dealings with the University of Maryland Medical System, Governor Larry Hogan said on Twitter. “Mayor Pugh has lost the public trust. She is clearly not fit to lead. For the good of the city, Mayor Pugh must resign,” Hogan wrote.  City Councilman Brandon Scott also called for Pugh’s resignation, saying in a statement: “Baltimore needs to move forward and heal from this embarrassment.” The Baltimore City Council previously called for her resignation earlier this month. Pugh has faced scrutiny in recent weeks over sales of her self-published children’s books and allegations - first reported by the Baltimore Sun - that she made sales deals with healthcare entities that have ties to the local government, including the state university’s medical system.  Representatives for the FBI and the IRS did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An FBI spokesman told the Sun and the Washington Post that federal agents were executing a court-authorized search of Pugh’s home and City Hall.  The Sun and other local news outlets also reported the FBI raided a second home owned by Pugh, a nonprofit she has closely worked with, the offices of her attorney and the home of one of her aides. According to the Sun, the University of Maryland Medical System paid Pugh $500,000 between 2012 and 2018 to buy copies of her book series promoting health choices for children at a time she also served on the medical system’s board. Pugh has been on an indefinite leave of absence since April 1, the same day Hogan had called on state prosecutors to start their probe.

147,"Former Senator Lugar, nuclear nonproliferation champion, dies at 87 - Reuters","April 28, 2019 /  4:34 PM / in 9 days","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Centrist Republican Richard Lugar, a soft-spoken foreign policy powerhouse who championed nuclear nonproliferation during 36 years in the U.S. Senate, died on Sunday at age 87. The Lugar Center, a Washington-based nonprofit, said in a statement that he died peacefully at the Inova Fairfax Heart and Vascular Institute in Virginia due to complications from CIDP, a chronic neurological disorder. Lugar, a professorial Midwesterner known for his keen intellect and mild demeanor, served eight years as mayor of Indianapolis starting in 1968 before his long stint in the Senate from 1977 to 2013. He was the longest-serving senator ever from Indiana. Lugar was an influential Republican voice on foreign policy. A former Rhodes scholar and an avid runner into his 70s, Lugar served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also headed the Agriculture Committee. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement praising Lugar for his Senate work, including reducing nuclear weapons after the end of the Cold War. “He was a man of great decency who was widely respected on both sides of the aisle for his vast policy knowledge, especially on foreign affairs, and his commitment to bipartisan solutions,” they said. Lugar’s political career ended when he sought nomination for a seventh six-year Senate term in 2012 but was challenged by the Republican Party’s right and beaten by a candidate backed by the conservative Tea Party movement, which did not like Lugar’s willingness to make bipartisan compromises. As a senator, Lugar sought to curb the spread of nuclear weapons globally. His greatest achievement, forged alongside centrist Democratic Senator Sam Nunn, was a law under which the United States paid for the dismantling and elimination of the nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union as well as chemical and biological arms. The 1991 measure was intended to keep nuclear weapons in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan from falling into the hands of hostile countries or extremist groups. Under the program, about 7,600 nuclear warheads were deactivated, 2,300 missiles destroyed and 24 nuclear weapons storage sites secured by the time Lugar’s Senate career ended. He was 80 years old and the senior most Republican in the Senate when he left the Senate in January 2013. After leaving politics, he founded the Lugar Center, which is focused on global issues such as weapons proliferation, food supply, foreign aid and governance. “Governance requires adaptation to shifting circumstances,” Lugar said in 2012 in his final speech on the Senate floor. “It often requires finding common ground with Americans who have a different vision than your own. It requires leaders who believe ... that their first responsibility to their constituents is to apply their best judgment.” He said Republicans “must be willing to suspend reflexive opposition that serves no purpose but to limit their own role in strategic questions and render cooperation impossible.” Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the top Senate Republican during Lugar’s final years in Congress, praised him in 2012 as the “model of the public servant.” “He’s earned the respect and admiration of everyone who ever crossed his path,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. “I assure you, in the world of politics, that’s nothing short of a miracle.” Lugar lost his first run for the Senate in 1974 against incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh, but two years later defeated another incumbent Democrat, Senator Vance Hartke. He was re-elected in 1982, 1988, 1994, 2000 and 2006. In seeking re-election in 2012, Lugar was beaten in the Republican primary by Richard Mourdock, Indiana’s state treasurer. Mourdock lost in the general election to Democratic U.S. congressman Joe Donnelly after the Republican nominee said in a debate that if a woman became pregnant in a rape, it was “something that God intended to happen.” In the Senate, Lugar amassed a largely conservative voting record but was willing to side with Democrats when his political convictions differed from the views of his party. He voted in 1986 to override Republican President Ronald Reagan’s veto of a bill to impose economic sanctions on South Africa during its racist apartheid era. He played a key role in persuading Reagan in 1986 to end support for Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos, leading to Marcos’ peaceful ouster. In 2007, Lugar criticized Republican President George W. Bush’s handling of the Iraq war, which began in 2003, particularly the stumbling U.S. efforts to stabilize and rebuild the country. Lugar’s 1996 bid for the Republican presidential nomination focused on a president’s role in leading the world toward a future secure from nuclear threats. But his stiff campaign style and refusal to conform to sound-bite themes doomed his chances and he dropped out early in the race. Born in Indianapolis on April 4, 1932, Lugar attended Pembroke College at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. He served in the Navy from 1957 to 1960, working as an intelligence officer. He married his wife, Charlene, in 1956. They had four sons.

148,"Former U.S. deputy attorney general: If Trump was not president, he would be indicted - Reuters","April 28, 2019 /  7:38 PM / 9 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former top Justice Department official Sally Yates said on Sunday that if Donald Trump were not president, he would have been indicted on obstruction charges in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Yates, a career federal prosecutor who rose to acting attorney general before Trump fired her in 2017 less than two weeks into his presidency, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” the Republican president was shielded by department guidelines that a sitting president should not be indicted.  “I’ve personally prosecuted obstruction cases on far, far less evidence than this,” Yates said. “And yes, I believe, if he were not the president of the United States, he would likely be indicted on obstruction.” Mueller’s report, redacted for classified and other sensitive information, detailed a series of actions by Trump to impede the investigation. It did not make a conclusion on whether those actions constituted the crime of obstruction said the findings did not exonerate him. The report cited attempts by Trump to thwart the Mueller investigation, as well as the president telling Russian officials he had faced “great pressure” from the probe but that it had been eased after he fired FBI Director James Comey. [nL1N22015W] Mueller also said Congress has the power to address whether Trump violated the law and Congress is conducting its own investigations into whether he obstructed justice. Yates told NBC there was a larger question raised by the report, which she said painted a “devastating portrait” of a campaign that welcomed Russian intervention, lied about it and then tried to cover it up. “Is this the kind of conduct that we should expect from the president of the United States?” she said. “I mean, when the Russians came knocking at their door, you would expect that a man who likes to make a show of hugging the flag would’ve done the patriotic thing and would’ve notified law enforcement.” Yates was fired by Trump after she took the extraordinarily rare step of defying the White House and refused to defend new travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.

150,US STOCKS-Wall St lower from Trump's China tariff threat but recovers some losses - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:06 PM / in 19 hours","4 Min Read* Trump threatens raising U.S. duties on Chinese goods * Tariff-sensitive Boeing, chipmakers fall * Energy, healthcare shares turn higher * Indexes down: Dow 0.28%, S&P 0.39%, Nasdaq 0.48% (Updates to late afternoon trading, changes byline, adds NEW YORK to dateline) By April Joyner NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted broad-based declines on Monday after President Donald Trump’s threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods reignited fears of a global economic slowdown, though the major indexes pared losses in afternoon trading as energy shares rose. Trump on Sunday said tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10%, reversing a decision he made in February to retain them at 10% as the United States and China made progress on trade talks. China said on Monday that a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States but did not mention if Vice Premier Liu He, its lead official in the negotiations, will be part of the team as originally planned. The threat sent the S&P 500 down as much as 1.6% during the session and led to a drop in U.S. Treasury yields as investors turned to low-risk government bonds. “It’s not a U.S. issue as much as a China-based issue,” said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. “But emerging market economic growth has been the engine of global growth over the past five years. When China catches a cold, Europe catches the flu and the U.S. catches the sniffles.” Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.4%. Chipmakers, which get a sizable portion of their revenue from China, also tumbled. The Philadelphia chip index slid 1.8%. Apple Inc shares, which have also been sensitive to signs of weakness in China, declined 1.5%. However, the major indexes pared some losses as some investors remained hopeful that a trade agreement would soon be reached. “Obviously it was a negative start, but the market still appears confident that we will get a China trade deal and this was Trump’s art of the deal strategy,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas. The S&P 500 energy index also turned positive in afternoon trading as oil prices reversed course to trade higher on rising tensions between the United States and Iran. Healthcare shares also rose. At the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday, Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins said he favored the sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.88 points, or 0.28%, to 26,431.07, the S&P 500 lost 11.47 points, or 0.39%, to 2,934.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 38.80 points, or 0.48%, to 8,125.20. The benchmark S&P 500 is now nearly 1% below its intra-day record high of 2,954.13 hit last week. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp shares rose 4.0% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a need for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed-upon $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Shares of Chevron rose 1.7%. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 57 new highs and 32 new lows.

152,"Greenlight's David Einhorn pitches long on AerCap, short on GATX at Sohn Conference - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  4:46 PM / Updated 19 hours ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - David Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital, at the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday said his firm is positive on airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and negative on railcar leasing company GATX Corp. Einhorn said GATX has “trouble returning to pre-crisis usage levels,” while AerCorp shares are trading at half the book value and less than half the price-to-earnings of GATX’s shares.  Speaking favorably of both industries, he said the airline sector has some advantages over rail that make AerCap the better choice over GATX, whose shares he believes are overvalued. “Neither has consumer-facing businesses, and both have terrible news. AerCap operates in a growing industry with a favorable outlook,” Einhorn said. “We think the market has it wrong.” AerCap shares are up 31% in 2019, while GATX has gained 11% year-to-date. AerCap is the industry leader with 11% marketshare, he noted. As aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have backlogs of multiple years, aircraft leasing companies step in to fill the gap as air travel continues to increase around the globe. Einhorn, who told the Sohn Investment Conference that the theme of his pitch involved Trains, Planes and Automobiles, referencing a 1987 movie, reassured the audience that he still did not like Tesla Inc. Einhorn started out with a slide show of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s statements about his electric car company and concluded by saying that’s “a lot of horseshit.” Einhorn has been short Tesla. In a letter to clients last month, Einhorn’s Greenlight renewed criticism of Musk and Tesla, saying the electric car company appeared to be “on the brink” of failure again.  The letter cited a lack of demand, “desperate” price cuts, layoffs, “closing-and-then-not-closing” stores, closing service centers, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and “a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA’s autonomous driving capabilities.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Einhorn’s remark.

154,Italian banks back BlackRock's 720 million euro Carige rescue plan - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:53 PM / in 20 hours","4 Min ReadMILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks have backed a 720 million euro rescue plan ($806 million) for rival Carige that will hand control of the Genoa-based bank to U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the head of a banking fund said on Monday.  Carige was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank at the start of the year after Italy’s Malacalza family, the lender’s top shareholder, blocked a proposed cash call, derailing an industry-financed rescue. Italian banks bought a 320 million euro hybrid bond issued by Carige in November to beef up its capital reserves. The investment was carried out through the voluntary-contribution arm of Italy’s FITD depositor protection fund. Speaking to reporters on Monday after a meeting of the voluntary scheme’s steering committee, FITD chairman Salvatore Maccarone said banks were set to convert 313 million euros worth of the hybrid bond into equity, giving them a roughly 43 percent stake in Carige. The debt-to-equity conversion is expected to receive final approval at an FITD general meeting on May 14, he said, adding the whole rescue plan, which includes the issue of further additional shares, would then be presented to the European Central Bank on May 17. “It’s a deal which we believe will solve (Carige’s) problems once and for all,” Maccarone said. The exact size of BlackRock’s investment is not yet known but it will cover the remainder of the new share issue apart from a small amount which will be available to current shareholders. BlackRock will take operational control and name a new chief executive, Maccarone said. The deal needs to be approved by Carige’s shareholders, meaning the position of the Malacalza family, which holds a 27.6 percent stake, will be key.  A shareholder meeting to vote on the plan is expected to take place in June or July, trade union FABI said in a statement after a meeting with the bank’s special administrators.  The union said the cash call should take place after the summer and that no additional job cuts were planned beyond the 1,250 cuts already announced in February. The family of steel billionaires will see its holding heavily diluted, even if it buys into the portion of the cash call reserved for current shareholders. The Malacalzas have invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015, although their stake was worth just 23 million euros when the bank was placed under special administration and trading in the stock halted.  The government has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares and stands ready to step in should a private investor fail to seal a deal.  State-owned soured loan vehicle SGA will take on the bank’s bad loans under the plan. “The overall deal has a number of pieces that must fall into place”, Maccarone said, including BlackRock being granted a waiver from a regulatory obligation to launch a full takeover bid for the bank. Carige has been laid low by years of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the depressed economy of the northwestern Liguria region.

155,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, yields fall as investors seek safety after Trump's China tariff threats - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  6:16 PM / Updated 21 hours ago","4 Min Read(Updates to afternoon, adds commentary) * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Stocks around the world slid on Monday, along with bond yields, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, triggering an investor exodus from risky assets. But assets such as oil and currencies changed direction as the day wore on as investors were not convinced Trump would follow through with a threat made on Sunday to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week. All the same, investors reduced their risk exposure, with U.S. Treasury yields lower as investors favored low-risk government bonds over stocks. Oil futures edged higher in volatile trade as rising tensions between the United States and Iran buoyed prices, which earlier touched a one-month low due to the tweets from Trump. In U.S. equities, the three major indexes fell after declines in Europe and China, where the Shanghai SE Composite had its biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016. U.S. indexes, however, pared their losses slightly by mid-afternoon. “The news gave investors a chance to take profits off the table. Markets are comfortable with the idea that Trump is using this as a negotiation tactic to get a trade deal done,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “Whether or not China will be able to meet the demands of the administration, that is questionable, but I think a trade agreement is on its way.” Fear about trade-war escalation was also balanced by a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Monday that a delegation was still preparing to go to United States for trade talks. “That’s what’s keeping markets from moving down further. People are realizing that if talks are still continuing there’s a chance that this escalation can once again de-escalate,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz Global Investors, New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 182.06 points, or 0.69%, to 26,322.89, the S&P 500 lost 22.77 points, or 0.77%, to 2,922.87 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 73.45 points, or 0.9%, to 8,090.55. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.88% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.84%. Japanese and London markets were both closed for holidays. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 2.4926%, from 2.53% late on Friday. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was down very slightly after firming earlier in the session against most major currencies while investors turned to safe-haven currencies after the Trump tweets. The dollar index fell 0.02%, with the euro up 0.04% to $1.1204. The Japanese yen weakened 0.28% versus the greenback at 110.86 per dollar. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 62 cents to $62.56 a barrel, a 1.0 percent gain, by 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Brent crude futures rose 65 cents to $71.50 a barrel, a 0.9 percent gain. “When you have a panic investors sell everything. After that the market discerns which ones deserve to be down. We’re continuing to put pressure on Iran and that’s continuing to put supply out of the Middle East under pressure,” said Shawn Hackett, president at Hackett Financial Advisors in Boca Raton, Fla. “Because of the reduction in supply out of Iran the U.S.-China trade issue isn’t enough to overcome that bullish factor.” Additional reporting by Amy Caren Daniel and Sruthi Shankar in

156,Starbucks' China rival Luckin seeks to raise up to $586.5 million in IPO - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  4:09 PM / in 20 hours","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Luckin Coffee Inc, the Chinese challenger to Starbucks Corp, is looking to raise up to $586.5 million, its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday showed. The company said it expects to offer 34.5 million American depository shares (ADS) priced between $15 and $17 per ADS in an initial public offering, giving it a valuation of between $3.48 billion and $3.95 billion. Each ADS represents eight Class A shares, the company said bit.ly/2YbOaoZ. Luckin Coffee, which has been expanding at breakneck speed, currently operates 2,370 stores in 28 Chinese cities and plans to open 2,500 more this year as it tries to displace Starbucks as China’s largest coffee chain.  The brand is banking on an increase in coffee consumption in China which has almost doubled to 8.7 billion cups last year from 4.4 billion in 2013 and is expected to further rise to 15.5 billion cups by 2023, according to a report cited by Luckin in its prospectus. Luckin has also expanded outside coffee, allowing customers to buy food and other beverages such as grapefruit cheese jasmine tea and Sichuan cold noodles with pulled chicken via its app. However, the company, founded in June 2017, is still loss making and has warned it may continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future. Its recorded a net loss to shareholders of $475.4 million and total revenue of $125.27 million, according to the filing. For the first three months of 2019, it posted a net loss of $85.3 million. The coffee chain was founded by Chief Executive Qian Zhiya, the former chief operating officer of car rental firm Car Inc, and two other senior executives and is backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC Pte Ltd. Other investors in the company include U.S. money manager BlackRock Inc and Chinese investment firms Centurium Capital and Joy Capital. The company intends to list on Nasdaq under the symbol “LK”.

157,"Banks tighten standards on commercial real estate, credit card loans - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  6:08 PM / in 20 hours","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks tightened standards on commercial real estate loans and on credit card borrowing during the first quarter, according to a survey of bank officers published on Monday. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s quarterly survey of senior loan officers also showed banks were taking steps to curb potential losses from loans to firms that are exposed to the risks of economic trouble in Asia and Europe, the Fed said. Europe and China are major U.S. trading partners and the economies of both have recently appeared to soften.  “A moderate net fraction of banks reported that they expect the quality of loans to exposed firms to deteriorate,” the Fed said. The report appeared to show some rising concerns over the economic outlook despite the many signs of a strong U.S. labor market and healthy economic growth. “A significant net share of banks reported weaker demand for construction and land development loans,” according to the report. Still, banks kept standards for auto loans and for commercial and industrial lending “basically unchanged” during the period although terms eased for some commercial and industrial loans, according to the Fed survey.

Despite his long call on HMO equities, Robbins said he does not like pharmaceutical stocks due to the political risk, with many Democratic presidential hopefuls - as well as President Donald Trump - opposed to lofty drug prices. “In pharmaceuticals ... the president can act unilaterally to reduce drug pricing,” Robbins warned. “The same drug in the United States costs three times as much as other” developed countries.  Robbins said Glenview has three long and 16 short positions in the pharmaceutical space and recommends investors short any ETF that tracks the space. Long a fan of healthcare stocks, Robbins in 2018 picked Express Scripts-Cigna, CVS-Aetna and McKesson as his winners in the field. 3M shares were down 2.2 percent in afternoon trading.

159,White House consents to congressional interview of ex-staffer on security - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  9:09 PM / in 10 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it has consented to a former staffer appearing before a congressional panel for an “on the record interview,” accompanied by his lawyers, regarding security clearance policies and procedures. The “reasonable accommodation offer” of a voluntary appearance by former White House Personnel Security Director Carl Kline before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform was disclosed in a letter to the panel’s ranking Republican, Jim Jordan. It came after Jordan, better known for stoking than soothing partisan frictions, sought to defuse tensions between House Democrats and the Trump administration with a letter urging the White House to agree to a voluntary committee interview on April 30 or May 1, according to two sources who saw Jordan’s letter. The House Oversight Committee is probing allegations that the administration inappropriately granted security clearances to some Trump advisers during Kline’s tenure as personnel security director for the White House. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone responded to Jordan, saying on Friday that Kline “is available to appear for an interview on Wednesday, May 1,” with the committee, according to a copy of the Cipollone letter obtained by Reuters. “We understand the scope of the interview will be limited to White House personnel security policies and practices, consistent with our prior offers for Mr. Kline’s voluntary cooperation with the Committee,” Cipollone said in the letter. The committee, chaired by Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, has issued a subpoena to compel Kline to testify before the panel under oath.  While acceding to an “on the record interview,” the Cipollone letter makes no mention of sworn testimony. He calls the subpoena “unnecessary” in light of the “additional accommodation offer made over three weeks ago” for Kline’s voluntary appearance. No immediate comment was available from Cummings or other Democrats on the committee, and it was not clear whether they would accept the terms laid out by Cipollone. Still, the approach by Jordan was the first sign since the release last week of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 elections that House Republicans might be willing to cooperate with Democrats on probes into national security issues. Among recipients of the security clearances at issue, said congressional sources who asked not to be named, were Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. Both allegedly obtained high-level clearances, despite recommendations from career security officials against it. In a dispute over the terms of Kline’s appearance before the committee, the White House had advised him to ignore the subpoena. The committee responded by moving to hold Kline in contempt of Congress, possibly followed by legal action. Two congressional sources told Reuters that Jordan’s letter to Cipollone on Friday had urged the White House “to avoid unnecessary conflict between Congress and the Executive Branch and to deescalate Chairman Cummings’s orchestrated inter-branch confrontation.” Jordan warned that Cummings might proceed with contempt of Congress proceedings against Kline as early as next week. Cummings launched the investigation after Tricia Newbold, a career security official at the White House, disclosed that the administration overruled experts to give questionable security clearances to more than two dozen people.

160,Biden raises $6.3 million in first 24 hours of campaign - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  6:42 PM / in 11 days","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, providing a stronger showing than any of his rivals. Biden, 76, brought in the bulk of that haul through smaller contributions, his campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo wrote on Twitter, with 97 percent of those donations under $200. He bested the rest of the Democratic field in first-day fundraising, including Bernie Sanders, who raised $5.9 million, and Beto O’Rourke, who brought in $6.1 million. Prior to entering the race on Thursday, Biden faced speculation that he was going to be unable to raise small-dollar donations via the Internet - which has been viewed as a test of viability and support in the Democratic Party. To qualify for the first debate in June, candidates need to receive donations from 65,000 different donors. Biden reached that mark in the first 12 hours of his campaign, Ducklo said. Biden has joined most of the rest of the Democratic field in swearing off donations from Washington lobbyists and PACs associated with corporations. But he did hold a fundraiser on the first day of his campaign at the Philadelphia home of David Cohen, a Comcast executive. Biden served as former President Barack Obama’s vice president for two terms. He is competing with 19 others for the Democratic presidential nomination and the chance to likely face President Donald Trump next year in the general election.

161,"Pentagon to send more troops to Mexico border, some in contact with migrants - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  5:13 PM / in 11 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Friday that it expected to send about 300 additional troops to the border with Mexico including roughly 100 cooks who would hand out meals, breaking with past policy to avoid troops coming in contact with migrants. It is the latest sign of a growing U.S. military support role for President Donald Trump’s politically charged immigration policies. Earlier this month, Trump said he would have to mobilize more of the military at the border with Mexico after listening to stories about migrants crossing the border from people attending a Republican fundraiser. The Pentagon previously said there were no plans for U.S. forces to interact with migrants as they support border agents dealing with illegal immigration. In addition to the cooks, the Pentagon is expected to send 160 drivers and 20 lawyers, Pentagon spokesman Charlie Summers said. “We will have some of our troops handing out meals, therefore (they) would come in contact with migrants,” Summers said. He said it was an “amendment to the current policy.” U.S. troops are assisting Border Patrol agents who have been overwhelmed trying to cope with a surge in migrants seeking asylum. The Department of Homeland Security a few weeks ago redeployed about 750 officers to the border to deal with the surge, resulting in a slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry. Summers said acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan had not yet signed the request for assistance from the Department of Homeland Security, but he was expected to do so. There are currently about 5,000 active-duty and National Guard troops near the border, though that number fluctuates. There has been increasing concern about the military playing a growing role on the border with Mexico.  The Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law on the books since the 1870s, restricts using the U.S. Army and other main branches of the military for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, unless specifically authorized by Congress. But the military can provide support services to law enforcement and has done so on occasion since the 1980s. Earlier this month six Mexican military personnel questioned two U.S. Army soldiers near Clint, Texas. A U.S. military investigation found the American soldiers were in U.S. territory during the incident, while the Mexican personnel believed they were south of the border.  Trump has made immigration a signature issue of his presidency and of his re-election campaign. He declared a national emergency over the issue earlier this year in an effort to redirect funding from Congress to build a wall along the U.S. southern border.

162,UPDATE 2-Investors seek euro zone havens as Trump ups pressure on China - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:51 AM / Updated a day ago","3 Min Read* Core euro zone bond yields fall as Trump threatens China * Final PMI shows stronger Germany, though slow growth in bloc * Italy hit by renewed coalition stability concerns (Updates pricing) By Virginia Furness LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Core euro zone bonds yields fell on Monday as investors sought safe havens after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, while PMI data pointed to anaemic growth in the euro zone. Trump’s move marked an escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from the president, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Global equity markets fell, with China’s main indexes down 5 percent. Treasuries rallied after Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would rise on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent. Trump also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region hit a low of -0.008 percent, turning negative for the first time since April 30. It was last down one basis point on the day to 0.01 percent.. “Everyone was quite optimistic that they were close to a deal … “ said Daniel Lenz, rates strategist at DZ Bankit. Trump’s threat “may cause the opposite action, talks might come to a stop, which is the fear everyone has.” Most other core 10-year yields in the bloc fell by up to two basis points before pulling back to trade flat on the day ,. Data on Monday painted a mixed picture of euro zone economic growth. Germany’s services stood out among a gloomier bloc-wide report from research firm Markit’s final purchasing manager data for April. German services created jobs in April at the fastest rate in more than a decade, offsetting deteriorating manufacturing, the data showed. But overall, weakness in euro zone manufacturing increasingly affected the dominant services industry. IHS Markit’s Euro Zone Composite Final Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), considered a good measure of overall economic health, dipped to 51.5 in April from March’s 51.6. However, overall investor improved for the third month in a row, reaching its highest since November 2018, the Sentix research group said on Monday. Italian government bonds underperformed the rest of the periphery. Concerns about the stability of the Italian government added to worries about global trade. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said on Monday a graft case involving a junior minister from the ruling League party would trigger a government crisis only if the League itself pushed for it. Italy’s short-dated bonds were up to six basis points higher before pulling back to around three basis points up on the day. The spread of its 10-year debt over Germany’s widened to nearly 260 basis points for the first time since April 30, before pulling back to 255 basis points Reporting by Virginia Furness, editing by Larry King and Jane

165,UPDATE 1-Brazil PMIs show economy got off to very sluggish start in Q2 - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  2:20 PM / in a day","2 Min Read(Adds detail, context, quote) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, May 6 (Reuters) - Brazil’s economy got off to an extremely slow start in the second quarter, figures released on Monday showed, with activity in the all-important services sector contracting in April for the first time since September last year. Combined with last week’s snapshot of the manufacturing sector, the IHS Markit purchasing managers index data showed overall economic activity in Brazil almost ground to a standstill in April. Coming on the same day a weekly central bank survey of financial institutions showed analysts cutting their median 2019 growth forecast to just 1.49 percent, the PMIs suggest the economy’s widespread weakness in the first quarter is spilling over into the second. “PMI data for the service sector reinforces the message of a cooling economy indicated by manufacturing figures,” said Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit. “The impact of softening demand conditions was more severe in the service sector ... (where) activity stalled and job shedding picked up to the fastest in 2019 so far,” she said. The services PMI fell to 49.9 in April from 52.7 in March and the composite PMI covering services and manufacturing activity fell to 50.6 from 53.1 in March, reflecting the steepest slowdown in growth since August. A reading below 50.0 signifies contraction and a reading above denotes expansion. Brazilian service providers remained optimistic that business activity will increase over the coming year, but confidence slipped to a 10-month low in April. Concerns about government policies, privatization and bankruptcy were among the factors restricting sentiment, IHS Markit said. Services account for around 70 percent of Brazil’s economy.

Trump said on Sunday tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10%, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at 10% as the two sides made progress on trade talks. China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States, but did not mention if Vice Premier Liu He, China’s lead official in the negotiations, will be part of the delegation as originally planned. The tariff threat rekindled fears of a global economic slowdown, sending oil prices lower and halting a recent rally that propelled the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes to record highs. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 2.5%, while chipmakers, which get a good portion of their revenue from China, tumbled. The Philadelphia chip index slid 2.63%, while the broader technology sector fell 1.60%, the most among the 11 major sectors trading lower. Apple Inc slid 2.2%, and dragged on the tech sector, while other marquee names such as Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc fell more than 1% and weighed on markets. “I don’t think it was done so flippantly to suggest Trump will not follow through with it, but there is an element of it being a negotiation tactic,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “These things are used as an excuse for investors to take profits because we have had such an enormous rally and valuations are relatively high and the impetus was on news to continue to be good and obviously this is not welcome news.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked to its highest level in nearly two months. At 9:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 351.27 points, or 1.33%, at 26,153.68, the S&P 500 was down 35.79 points, or 1.22%, at 2,909.85. The Nasdaq Composite was down 114.54 points, or 1.40%, at 8,049.46. Automakers General Motors Co declined 2.8%, while Ford Motor dropped 1.3%. Tesla Inc slipped 1.5%, also weighed down by U.S. trade officials rejecting the company’s bid for relief from tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot “brain” of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp rose 3% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp . The oil major was up 1%, the only gainer among Dow components. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 6.15-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 5.11-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

167,Volkswagen sounds out buyers for MAN Energy Solutions -sources - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:16 PM / a day ago","3 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen has approached several companies to gauge their appetite for buying MAN Energy Solutions, which makes large diesel engines for ships and power generators, people close to the matter said. The informal sales pitch is part of Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess’s efforts to slim down and simplify the group which has 12 brands, trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars and electric bicycles as part of its business.    Volkswagen has not yet started a formal sales process or appointed an adviser for the sale of the company but has contacted rivals in the engine manufacturing business such as Cummins, Wartsila and private-equity owned Jenbacher, these sources said.  Volkswagen declined to comment. “Volkswagen wants to see what would be possible,” one of the people said, adding that depending on the feedback it gets the carmaker could launch a formal sales process later this year. People familiar with the matter said that they expected MAN Energy Solutions to achieve a valuation of about 3 billion euros  ($3.36 billion) in a potential sale. The business, formerly known as MAN Diesel & Turbo, also makes turbochargers used in the oil & gas industry and in 2018 reported operating earnings of 133 million euros on sales of 3.1 billion euros.  The sources said it could also attract interest from Mitsubishi Heavy, Alfa Laval as well as from private equity groups such EQT, Bain and Cinven if it is formerly put up for sale, the sources said. The potential sales process follows Volkswagen’s decision earlier this year to scrap plans for an initial public offering of its Traton trucks unit, which features the MAN, Scania and Volkswagen Caminhoes e Onibus brands. Volkswagen has struggled to slim down in the past after the company’s works council, which has veto power over major restructuring moves, blocked efforts to sell motorbike brand Ducati and transmissions maker Renk. MAN Energy Solutions was originally a part of VW’s trucks brand MAN, but some of MAN’s assets were transferred to Volkswagen last year as part of efforts to streamline Traton ahead of the planned listing.

168,FOREX-Dollar rides safe-haven flows on Trump tariff threats; yen up - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  2:05 PM / in a day","3 Min Read* Risk assets reel as Trump tweets on China unnerve markets * Yen rises to five-week high vs. U.S. dollar (New throughout, updates rates and adds comments post-U.S. market open; new byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar firmed against most major currencies on Monday but lost ground to the Japanese yen after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would sharply raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week, risking the derailment of trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Trump on Monday slammed China over its trade practices, saying the United States was losing billions on trade with China. The comments followed his weekend threat to ratchet up tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China, even as ongoing talks between Washington and Beijing as were set to continue this week. On Friday, Trump had cited progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “After weeks of talks and suggestions from the U.S. administration that a deal was close, the sudden ramping up of trade tensions caught investors by surprise,” Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said in a note. “The FX markets are reacting in a classic risk-off manner, with the USD trading mainly higher,” he said. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency versus a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.12% at  97.634. Increased trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have generally been supportive of the dollar as investors view the United States to be in better shape than its rivals to weather a trade war. Against the Japanese yen, which tends to benefit during geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world’s biggest creditor nation, the dollar fell 0.21% to  110.86 yen. The greenback dipped to a five-week low of 110.29 earlier in the session. “USDJPY has broken the key 110.70 level and a close below here is technical bearish for the pair,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. “A risk to the trade is that trade rhetoric becomes less escalatory, generating a reversal in price action, supporting risk, and pushing USDJPY higher,” they said. Asian currencies were largely weaker with the Chinese yuan slipping almost 1% to near its lowest levels this year, around 6.80 per dollar. Both the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira fell against the U.s. currency. Other currencies whose fortunes are linked to the Chinese economy such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, declined about 0.5% each. Sterling declined 0.6% and reversed some of Friday’s gains, after opposition Labour Party accused Prime Minister Theresa May of leaking details of the compromise under discussion and jeopardizing talks.

169,Fed's Harker says downward trend in inflation could be 'transitory' - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  2:01 PM / in a day","2 Min ReadMay 6 (Reuters) - Some recent weakness in U.S. inflation could be “transitory,” suggesting no reason to adjust monetary policy at this point, one top Federal Reserve policymaker said on Monday. Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said he is keeping his medium-range inflation and near-term growth forecasts unchanged, giving further support to a statement on inflation last week by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that took markets by surprise. “If any component of the outlook were to affect my view on the appropriate path of monetary policy, it would be inflation,” Harker said in remarks prepared for delivery at a monetary and trade conference in Philadelphia. “However, we’re not there yet, and it would take more data to convince me. I therefore continue to see one increase at most this year; possibly one, at most, next.” Powell surprised markets last week by saying that lower inflation trends could be explained partly by “transitory” factors, including fund management fees, apparel prices and air fares. The remarks were seen by some investors as more aggressive on possible inflation risks than expected. Harker said he suspects that is true. And while Harker still sees a strong labor market and described initial data on first-quarter U.S. economic growth as “a pleasant surprise,” he said it is possible that some of the trade-related factors driving that growth could prove temporary and slow in the second quarter.

170,PRECIOUS-Gold steadies as Trump's tariff threat supports dollar - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:16 AM / a day ago","3 Min Read* Trump says he will hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week * SPDR gold holdings fall to lowest since Oct. 11 * Asian, European stocks tumble (Updates prices) By Harshith Aranya May 6 (Reuters) - Gold was little changed on Monday as the dollar gained after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions and prompting investors to sell riskier assets. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,277.66 per ounce, as of 1324 GMT. U.S. gold futures were down 0.1 percent to $1,279.80 an ounce. U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported into the United States from China. “We are seeing the markets reacting to uncertainty about trade talks. It is creating some nervousness in the markets. The dollar is a tad stronger, countering some of the potential moves we would have seen otherwise in gold,” said Ole Hansen, commodity strategist at Saxo Bank. The dollar, which was the preferred safe-haven from U.S.-China trade tensions since last year, was up 0.1 percent. Gold had earlier hit a near one-week peak of $1,285.51 an ounce as Trump’s comments dented global shares and oil prices. “Despite the increase in gold prices, technical analysis suggests that downward pressure on the yellow metal continues to manifest,” OCBC analysts said in a research note, adding that most of the intra-day move was likely related to covering short positions and hedging against market risks. “The medium term still suggests a large range-bound consolidation of $1,270 to $1,300.” Last week, the mood among gold investors had turned gloomy, pushing the metal to a four-month low after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a rate cut this year. Hedge funds and money managers switched to a net long position in COMEX gold in the week to April 30, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. “The hedge fund community is extremely confused, flipping long and short positions. $1,290 is the key level for gold, and if prices break above that we could see quite an addition on the long side,” Hansen said. Meanwhile, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold backed exchange, were at their lowest since Oct. 11. Holdings fell 0.6 percent on Friday. However, physical demand for the metal had been robust last week with India and Singapore leveraging the correction in prices ahead of a key gold-buying festival. Silver slipped 1 percent to $14.78 per ounce, while platinum fell 1.2 percent to $858.25 per ounce. Palladium dropped 1.6 percent to $1,348.51 an ounce.

171,MONEY MARKETS-U.S. fed funds rate falls near six-week low - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  1:50 PM / in a day","2 Min Read(Adds background, graphic) NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - The interest that U.S. banks charge each other to borrow reserves slipped to its lowest in about six weeks on Friday following the Federal Reserve’s adjustment last week on what it pays banks on reserves, New York Federal Reserve data released on Monday showed. The average, or effective, federal funds rate dipped to 2.40% on Friday, the lowest level since March 26. The rate which the U.S. central bank targets to conduct monetary policy, was 2.41% the day before. The fed funds rate’s premium above the Fed’s interest on excess reserves (IOER) decreased to 5 basis points from a record high 6 basis points on Thursday. A number of factors had resulted in the recent rise in the fed funds rate, including reduced bank reserves linked to the Fed’s balance sheet normalization, increased government borrowing, and less willingness by big banks to lend reserves due to tougher capital standards in response to the global credit crisis. Last Wednesday, the Fed narrowed the gap between the IOER and the bottom end of its target rate on interest rates for a third time since last June in a bid to prevent the fed funds rate from reaching the top of the range. It trimmed IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35%, while holding its target range at 2.25-2.50%. Reporting by Richard Leong

172,"Like Trump, Democrat Buttigieg bills himself as a turnaround expert - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  10:05 AM / 11 days ago","6 Min ReadMARSHALLTOWN, Iowa (Reuters) - Four years ago, Donald Trump campaigned in small towns like Marshalltown, Iowa, vowing to restore economic prosperity to the U.S. heartland. In his bid to replace Trump in the White House, Pete Buttigieg is taking a similar tack. The difference, he says, is that he can point to a model of success: South Bend, Indiana, the revitalized city where he has been mayor since 2012. The Democratic presidential contender has vaulted to the congested field’s top tier in recent weeks, drawing media and donor attention for his youth, history-making status as the first openly gay major presidential candidate and a resume that includes military service in Afghanistan. But Buttigieg’s main argument for his candidacy is that he is a turnaround artist in the mold of Trump, although the Democrat does not expressly invoke the comparison with the Republican president. “I’m not going around saying we’ve fixed every problem we’ve got,” Buttigieg, 37, said after a house party with voters in Marshalltown. “But I’m proud of what we have done together, and I think it’s a very powerful story.” Critics argue improving the fortunes of a Midwestern city of 100,000 people does not qualify Buttigieg, who has never held national office, for the presidency of a country of 330 million. Others say South Bend still has pockets of despair and that minorities, in particular, have failed to benefit from its growth. Buttigieg has told crowds in Iowa and elsewhere that his experience in reviving a struggling Rust Belt community allows him to make a case to voters that other Democratic candidates cannot. That may give him the means to win back some of the disaffected Democratic voters who turned their backs on Hillary Clinton in 2016 to vote for Trump. Watching Buttigieg at a union hall in Des Moines last week, Rick Ryan, 45, a member of the United Steelworkers, lamented how many of his fellow union workers voted for Trump. The president turned in the best performance by a Republican among union households since Ronald Reagan in 1984.  Ryan said he hoped someone like Buttigieg could return them to the Democratic fold.  “He’s aware of the decline in the labor force in America, not just in Indiana or Des Moines or anywhere else,” Ryan said. “Jobs are going overseas. We need a find to way to bring that back.” Randy Tucker, 56, of Pleasant Hill, Iowa, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said Trump appealed to union members “desperate for somebody to reach out to them, to help them, to listen to their voice.” Buttigieg could do the same, he said. “In my heart right now, he’s No. 1.” Buttigieg stresses a key difference in his and Trump’s approaches. Trump, he tells crowds, is mired in the past, promising to rebuild the 20th century industrial economy. Buttigieg argues the pledge is misleading and unrealistic. Buttigieg says his focus is on the future, and he often talks about what the country might look like decades from now. “The only way that we can cultivate what makes America great is to look to the future and not be afraid of it,” Buttigieg said in Marshalltown. Buttigieg knows his sexual preference may be a barrier to winning some blue-collar voters. But he notes that after he came out as gay in 2015, he won a second term as mayor with 80 percent of the vote in conservative Indiana. Earlier this month, he announced his presidential bid at the hulking plant in South Bend that stopped making Studebaker autos more than 50 years ago. After lying dormant for decades, the building is being transformed into a high-tech hub after Buttigieg and other city leaders realized it would never again attract a large-scale industrial company. “That building sat as a powerful reminder. We hoped we would get back that major employer that would fix our economy,” said Jeff Rea, president of the regional Chamber of Commerce.  Buttigieg is praised locally for spurring more than $100 million in downtown investment. During his two terms, unemployment has fallen to 4.1 percent from 11.8 percent. But a study released in 2017 by the nonprofit group Prosperity Now said not all of the city’s residents had shared in its rebound. The median income for African-Americans remained half that of whites, while the unemployment rate for blacks was double.  Regina Williams-Preston, a city councilor running to replace Buttigieg as mayor, credits him for the revitalized downtown. But she said he had a “blind spot” when it came to focusing on troubled neighborhoods like the one she represents and only grew more engaged after community pressure.  “He understands it now,” she said. “The next step is figuring out how to open the doors of opportunity for everyone.” Trump touts the fact that the United States added almost 300,000 manufacturing jobs last year as evidence he made good on his promise to restore the industrial sector. But that growth still left the country with fewer manufacturing jobs than in 2008. The robust U.S. economy is likely the president’s greatest asset in his re-election bid, particularly in states he carried in 2016 such as Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. He won Buttigieg’s home state by 19 points over Clinton in 2016. Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Democratic Party in Polk County, Iowa, said Buttigieg would be well positioned to compete with Trump in the Midwest. “People love the fact that he’s a mayor,” said Bagniewski, who has not endorsed a candidate in the nominating contest. “If you can talk about a positive future, and if you actually have experience that can do it, that’s a compelling vision in Iowa.” Nan Whaley, the mayor of Dayton, Ohio, which faces many of the same challenges as South Bend, agreed. “He’s one of us,” Whaley said. “That helps.” Reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

173,Trump denies telling White House counsel to fire Mueller from Russia probe - Reuters,"April 25, 2019 /  12:11 PM / in 11 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump denied on Thursday that he had ordered then-White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller from the Russia investigation, moving to undermine McGahn’s credibility ahead of a possible congressional testimony.  Trump’s move appears to be part of an effort by the White House to push back on attempts by congressional Democrats to pursue investigations related to Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference in 2016 and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. “As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so. If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself,” Trump wrote on Twitter.     A redacted version of Mueller’s report released last week mentioned conversations in June 2017, when Trump called McGahn to tell him he should direct Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was overseeing the special counsel’s probe, to remove Mueller because of conflicts of interest.     The report cited “McGahn’s clear recollection” that the president directed him to tell Rosenstein that “Mueller has to go.” McGahn did not carry out Trump’s order, the report said.  Trump also tried unsuccessfully to get McGahn to dispute media reports that the president had attempted to fire Mueller, the report said. Mueller’s report uncovered numerous links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and described how Trump tried to impede the Russia investigation.    But it said there was not enough evidence to establish that the Trump campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow, and did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice. A lawyer for McGahn declined to comment on Trump’s tweet. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly attacked McGahn’s veracity since the report’s release. Giuliani has called the former White House counsel “hopelessly confused” and said his account may be “the product of an inaccurate recollection.” The Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives judiciary panel has issued a subpoena for McGahn to testify and provide documents to the committee.  But it is not clear whether the White House would try to stop him from testifying by claiming executive privilege, a legal doctrine allowing the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government. Trump has vowed to fight every subpoena from House Democrats probing his administration and has ordered officials not to obey legal requests for cooperation from the Democratic-led House. In response, Democratic House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings has accused Trump of an “unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction.”     Reporting by Makini Brice; additional reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Alistair BellAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

174,UK opposition leader Corbyn says won't attend Trump state dinner - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  2:50 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, said on Friday he had turned down an invitation to a state dinner which will be one of the highlights of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to Britain in June. “Theresa May should not be rolling out the red carpet for a state visit to honor a president who rips up vital international treaties, backs climate change denial and uses racist and misogynist rhetoric,” Corbyn said in a statement. The left-wing Labour leader has long railed against U.S. foreign policy and said recently that Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States where he faces a computer hacking charge. Corbyn said he would welcome a meeting with Trump “to discuss all matters of interest” but said maintaining ties with Washington did not require “the pomp and ceremony of a state visit.” Trump is due to visit Britain between June 3 and 5 when he will become only the third U.S. president to have been accorded a state visit by Queen Elizabeth. However, Trump will not stay in Buckingham Palace, as foreign leaders typically do during state visits, because of renovation work. Almost 1.9 million Britons signed a petition in 2017 saying Trump should not be offered a state visit.

176,Brazil's Bradesco to buy Florida bank to focus on wealthy individuals - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:02 PM / Updated a day ago","2 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Banco Bradesco SA has embarked on its first-ever international acquisition by paying approximately $500 million to buy BAC Florida Bank, which focuses on high-net-worth individuals in a move intended to close the gap with Brazilian rivals. Based in Coral Gables, BAC Florida is controlled by Grupo Pellas, which was founded in 1877 in Nicaragua. After the deal closes, Bradesco said its main goal is to provide a wide range of financial services in the United States to Bradesco clients and lure new customers to BAC Florida. Bradesco Chief Executive Officer Octavio de Lazari said on a call with journalists that the Brazilian bank’s private banking clients have increasingly demanded diversification and greater access to global products. “This move underscores our expansion not only in the U.S., but also in Latin America as a whole, as BAC has clients all over the region,” he said. Around 20 percent of BAC Florida’s clients are Brazilian and 9 percent are American. Still, Lazari said Bradesco is not seeking to build a retail base outside Brazil, but wants to boost its private banking business, which manages nearly $50 billion in assets. BAC Florida will add 10,000 customers to Bradesco’s 13,000 private banking clients in Brazil.   “This acquisition is small for Bradesco (less than 1 percent of the bank’s market cap) and tends to help the bank to reduce the gap of its private banking business,” Itaú BBA said in a note to clients, estimating a 30 basis point impact on capital. Bradesco’s footprint in private banking is smaller than rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA, which has $120 billion in assets under management. Itaú acquired the Latin America private banking business of ABN Amro and now-defunct BankBoston nearly 12 years ago.   BAC Florida ended 2018 with total assets of $2.2 billion and net income of $29 million. One of its main business segments is real estate financing.

Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. On Friday, he had cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. U.S. Treasury yields held at lower levels as investors favored the safety of low-risk government bonds over stocks and other risky assets due to the increased trade tension between China and the United States. In U.S. equities trading, the three major indexes fell after declines in Europe and China, where the Shanghai SE Composite had its biggest one-day percentage drop since February 2016. “The probability of a no-deal scenario is now elevated and markets will have to price that accordingly,” said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, New York. “Our base case remains that there’s still a more than 50 percent chance a deal ultimately does occur, but now with more market volatility and more contentiousness.” Trump’s recent decision to walk away from talks with North Korea is likely at the back of investors’ minds, according to Mahajan. But this fear is being balanced out by a statement from China’s foreign ministry on Monday that a delegation was still preparing to go to United States for trade talks. “That’s what’s keeping markets from moving down further. People are realizing that if talks are still continuing there’s a chance that this escalation can once again de-escalate,” she said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 260.73 points, or 0.98%, to 26,244.22, the S&P 500 lost 31.1 points, or 1.06%, to 2,914.54 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 102.97 points, or 1.26%, to 8,061.02.

179,Hudson's Bay pursuing alternatives for Lord + Taylor - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  1:51 PM / Updated a day ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Canadian retail operator Hudson’s Bay Co said on Monday that it was pursuing strategic alternatives such as a sale or merger for its department store Lord + Taylor, which has struggled to attract shoppers. Lord + Taylor, founded in 1826 and the oldest U.S. department store, has seen its fortunes fall while Hudson’s Bay’s luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue has managed to increase sales.  Brick-and-mortar retailers like Lord + Taylor have faced hard times as online shopping on sites including Amazon.com Inc  gains popularity. Retailer Walmart  announced last year that it would offer a Lord + Taylor flagship store on its website.  Hudson’s Bay said in a prepared statement that its plans to find a buyer for Lord + Taylor is part of efforts to focus on its “greatest opportunities.” “Over the last year, we’ve taken bold actions and made fundamental fixes that have resulted in a far stronger, more capable (Hudson’s Bay), having returned to positive operating cash flow, increased profitability and strengthened the balance sheet,” Hudson’s Bay Chief Executive Helena Foulkes said in a press release. Co-working space landlord WeWork Cos bought Lord + Taylor’s flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York City for $850 million two years ago. Hudson’s Bay has already announced plans to close up to 10 Lord + Taylor locations. The chain had 45 stores as of Feb. 2 and three outlet shops. Earlier this year, Hudson’s Bay opened a renovated main floor at the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship in New York.  Last year, Hudson’s Bay was trying to revive Lord + Taylor’s fortunes, Reuters reported. One option it had considered was buying retailer Bon-Ton Stores Inc, which had filed for bankruptcy, and merging it with the chain. A sale was a possibility at the time, but was considered unlikely given that there were few potential buyers who would pay top dollar, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Hudson’s Bay has retained PJ SOLOMON as its financial adviser for the review of the Lord + Taylor business, the company said.

180,US STOCKS-Wall Street falls after Trump's China tariff threat - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  3:41 PM / in a day","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * U.S. to raise duties on $200 bln worth Chinese goods-Trump * Tariff-sensitive Boeing, chipmakers fall * Technology shares fall most among the S&P sectors * Indexes down: Dow 0.87%, S&P 0.90%, Nasdaq 0.99% (Changes comment, updates prices) By Amy Caren Daniel May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted broad-based declines on Monday, but bounced back from session lows, after President Donald Trump’s surprise threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods this week, sparking a flight from riskier assets. Trump on Sunday said tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10%, reversing a decision he made in February to retain them at 10% as the two sides made progress on trade talks. China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States, but did not mention if Vice Premier Liu He, its lead official in the negotiations, will be part of the team as originally planned. “The news gave investors a chance to take profits off the table. Markets are comfortable with the idea that Trump is using this as a negotiation tactic to get a trade deal done,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “Whether or not China will be able to meet the demands of the administration, that is questionable, but I think a trade agreement is on its way.” Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.7%, while chipmakers, which get a good portion of their revenue from China, tumbled. The Philadelphia chip index slid 2.34%, while the broader technology sector fell 1.28%, the most among the 11 major sectors trading lower. Apple Inc declined 2.1%, and dragged on the tech sector, while other marquee names such as Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc fell about 1%. The threat, which rekindled fears of a global economic slowdown, sent U.S. Treasury yields lower as investors turned to low-risk government bonds. At 11:04 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 230.33 points, or 0.87%, at 26,274.62. The S&P 500 was down 26.59 points, or 0.90%, at 2,919.05 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 81.04 points, or 0.99%, at 8,082.96. The benchmark S&P 500 is now about 1% away from its intra-day record high of 2,954.13 hit last week. Automakers General Motors Co declined 2.7%, while Ford Motor dipped 0.6%. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp rose 3.6% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a need for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp . The oil major was up 1.6%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.12-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 29 new lows.

183,House Democrats demand documents on Trump's DHS purge - Reuters,"April 25, 2019 /  6:47 PM / 12 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairmen of three U.S. House committees sought documents on Thursday related to recent Trump administration firings of top Department of Homeland Security officials, escalating tensions between congressional Democrats and the White House over immigration policy. U.S. Representatives Elijah Cummings, Bennie Thompson and Jerrold Nadler, Democrats who head the House of Representatives Oversight, Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, said in a statement they were “concerned that the president may have removed DHS officials because they refused his demands to violate federal immigration law and judicial orders.” The chairmen said they were particularly interested in documents relating to recent moves by President Donald Trump and Stephen Miller, a former congressional aide who has become a top presidential adviser on immigration, to purge DHS of “senior leaders” who “reportedly refused orders to violate the law.” The committee leaders’ move followed a White House declaration that it was refusing a request from the Oversight Committee for Miller to testify before the panel. In a letter to the committee on Wednesday, the White House said Miller would not testify about administration immigration initiatives, including Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents and his threat to send immigrants in the country illegally to so-called sanctuary cities. “In accordance with longstanding precedent, we respectfully decline the invitation to make Mr. Miller available for testimony before the committee,” the White House counsel said in the letter, which was provided to Reuters on Thursday. The Republican president is pushing back against legal requests from Democratic-led House committees, which are conducting wide-ranging investigations of Trump and his administration, including his tax returns, White House security clearances and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. In their Thursday letter, the Democratic committee chairmen noted that DHS recently announced the departures of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the department’s undersecretary for management, the director of the U.S. Secret Service and the acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Cummings, whose committee has launched multiple investigations into Trump administration and White House policies, accused Trump on Wednesday of an “unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction” after he ordered federal employees not to comply with congressional investigations. Cummings on April 17 invited Miller to testify voluntarily about why the administration decided to separate immigrant children from their parents at the border. Cummings also called for an explanation of “transferring asylum seekers to sanctuary cities as a form of illegal retribution against your political adversaries, and firing top administration officials who refuse orders to violate the law.” Trump has said he is considering sending immigrants in the country illegally to jurisdictions that have adopted some form of “sanctuary city” policies in which they refuse to use their resources to help federal agents enforce deportations. Miller, a former Senate aide, helped shape some of Trump’s most contentious immigration policies, from a ban on Muslim immigrants proposed shortly after Trump took office in 2017 to the child separation policy, both of which were rejected by courts. The oversight panel could move to subpoena Miller, but the White House could invoke executive privilege to protect his discussions with Trump.

185,Inspector General clears acting Pentagon chief in probe - Reuters,"April 25, 2019 /  11:50 AM / in 12 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department’s inspector general on Thursday concluded acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan did not seek preferential treatment of Boeing Co, his former employer, while at the Pentagon.    The decision potentially opens the door for U.S. President Donald Trump to formally nominate Shanahan to be defense secretary. The inspector general started the investigation in March after a watchdog group filed a complaint alleging Shanahan promoted aerospace firm Boeing in meetings and disparaged competitors.    Shanahan, 56, who spent more than three decades at Boeing, is the longest serving acting defense secretary ever. He took over at the Pentagon in an acting capacity on Jan. 1 after Jim Mattis resigned amid policy differences with Trump. The inspector general’s report, which was published on Thursday, said none of the allegations against Shanahan were substantiated. “We determined that Mr. Shanahan fully complied with his ethics agreements and his ethical obligations regarding Boeing and its competitors,” it said.    The report said investigators had interviewed Shanahan and 33 other witnesses, including Mattis and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva, and reviewed more than 5,600 unclassified documents and about 1,700 pages of classified documents. The report said it found that while Shanahan did refer to his time at Boeing, witnesses saw it as Shanahan trying to improve management of Pentagon programs. One of the allegations was that Shanahan criticized the F-35 aircraft made by Lockheed Martin and “repeatedly dumped” on the jet in meetings. But the report said his comments about the F-35 program were consistent with comments about problems cited by other senior Pentagon officials. The investigation was in part based on a complaint filed by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, which said Shanahan had appeared to violate the ethical rules by promoting Boeing while at the Pentagon.  Officials close to Shanahan have said they believe the investigation was one of the main reasons he has not been nominated yet for the job formally. There is growing speculation that after being cleared by the inspector general, Trump could nominate Shanahan in the coming days. If nominated, Shanahan would have to be confirmed by the Senate.

The move by Chicago-based Conagra is similar to that of Kraft Heinz, which plans to sell Italian baby food business Plasmon to focus on its global brands. Conagra, which owns Birds Eye frozen vegetable meals among others, wanted to divest Gelit because it is a private label company and a local brand, a source close to the matter said.  The parties did not reveal the financial details but the source said the Italian consortium of private equity firms Consilium and Progressio and entrepreneur Massimo Menna paid a little more than 70 million euros ($78.3 million). Gelit, which produces frozen ready meals for supermarket chains, last year achieved sales of 45 million euros and core earnings of 9 million euros. The buyers have been advised by Banca IMI and legal firm BonelliErede. Intesa Sanpaolo’s Mediocredito Italiano provided funding for the deal, the buyers said.

187,UPDATE 2-Sandvik eyes listing of specialty steel business - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:09 PM / a day ago","3 Min Read* Sandvik says to consider IPO of Materials Tech unit * Unit has been seen as long-standing spin-off candidate (Adds more context, analyst, updates shares) By Johannes Hellstrom and Esha Vaish STOCKHOLM, May 6 (Reuters) - Swedish engineering group Sandvik is considering listing its Materials Technology (SMT) business after announcing plans on Monday to separate it from the rest of the group. SMT, Sandvik’s specialty steel business, has been seen as a spin-off candidate for many years, and has lagged far behind the group’s main machining solutions and mining gear units in terms of both sales and profitability. Sandvik had previously said it expected to announce its plans for SMT later this year. The SMT business, which makes seamless tubes and different strip steel products, represents the original core of 157-year old Sandvik. The unit still has some 3,000 staff in the Swedish town of Sandviken, where the group was founded and where Sandvik used to have its group headquarters. “The decision to initiate an internal separation of Sandvik Materials Technology is based on the board’s belief that each part will develop more favourably by itself, increasing opportunities for profitable growth and improving long-term shareholder value,” Sandvik Chairman Johan Molin said in a statement on Monday. “The board of directors has also decided to explore the possibility of a separate listing at the Nasdaq Stockholm Exchange, should that strengthen Sandvik Materials Technology’s position and future development,” Sandvik added. Sandvik’s shares were down 2.3 percent at 166.45 crowns by 1335 GMT, recovering somewhat from an earlier drop of 2.8 percent made before the news was announced. Pareto Securities analyst Anders Roslund told Reuters that business could have an enterprise value of 12.2 billion Swedish crowns ($1.3 billion). The figure equates to roughly 10 Swedish crowns per share, he said, adding that in an “optimistic scenario” the unit could fetch a 10-15 percent higher valuation. The separation and preparation for a possible listing is expected to take at least a year. The news from Sandvik comes at a time when companies are increasingly focusing on streamlining their businesses, including looking at separations and spin-offs to remain focused on what they view as core operations. Similar moves in Sweden in recent years have included mining gear maker Epiroc’s spin-off from industrial group Atlas Copco and auto tech firm Veoneer’s separation from airbag maker Autoliv Materials Technology accounts for around 15 percent of Sandvik’s sales and 7 percent of the group’s operating profit.

192,"Trump renews threat to close Mexican border, send more troops - Reuters","April 24, 2019 /  12:39 PM / 13 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday again threatened to close part of the southern border and send more “armed soldiers” to defend it if Mexico did not block a new caravan of migrants traveling toward the United States. “A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border & call up the Military.”  Trump also said, without offering details, that Mexican soldiers recently had “pulled guns” on U.S. troops in what he suggested was “a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers.”  “Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending & returning!” Trump tweeted. It was not clear what Trump meant by “armed soldiers” since at least some of the troops on the border already are armed. It also was unclear what specific caravan Trump was alluding to. U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they are expecting a request from the Department of Homeland Security in the coming days for additional troops, although that number is expected to be in the low hundreds. About 5,000 active duty and National Guard troops already are at the border. The U.S. Defense Department said earlier this month that six Mexican military personnel questioned two U.S. Army soldiers near Clint, Texas, about 30 miles (48 km) southeast of El Paso. The U.S. military said the Americans were in an unmarked car and an inquiry had found that they were in U.S. territory. Newsweek magazine, citing the military report filed on the incident, said the U.S. soldiers were briefly held at gunpoint by the Mexicans, who took one American soldier’s gun and put it in the car. The Mexican troops had believed the U.S. soldiers were south of the border and therefore in Mexico. After a brief discussion, the Mexican troops left the area, a Mexican official said. The two U.S. soldiers were traveling in an unmarked vehicle, according to a brief statement issued later on Wednesday by the Mexican foreign ministry, which added to the confusion. Asked about Trump’s tweet at a news conference, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his administration would investigate the incident Trump mentioned. “But we’re not going to fight with the U.S. government,” he said. “We are not going to allow ourselves to fall into any provocations.” Trump has made a tough stance on immigration a cornerstone of his presidency. He called the situation at the southern border a national emergency as a way to get money to build a border wall after Democrats in Congress thwarted traditional means of funding. Officials arrested or denied entry to more than 100,000 people along the Mexican border in March, more than twice as many as during the same period last year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In March, Trump threatened to close the border if the Mexican government did not immediately stem illegal migration, although later he praised Mexico for efforts to stop people from crossing illegally into the United States.  Mexico has returned 15,000 migrants in the past 30 days, a senior government official said on Tuesday, pointing to an uptick in deportations in the face of pressure from Trump to stem the flow of people north. In San Francisco, three U.S. Court of Appeals judges heard arguments on whether to shut down the government’s program of sending immigrants back to Mexico to await their asylum proceedings rather than staying in the United States. A lower-court judge ordered a halt to the program on April 8 but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that order and was considering whether to extend the stay or lift it during the appeals process. Civil rights groups convinced the lower court that the program, known as Migrant Protection Protocols, violated U.S. obligations not to send asylum seekers to a country where they face fears of persecution. “How can you want to comply with this obligation if you don’t at least ask this person, ‘Hey, by the way, before we send you to Mexico, do you have a fear of returning there?’” Judge Paul Watford asked a Department of Justice attorney. The three judges did not say when they expected to rule. The Trump administration says the policy is one way to reduce the number of asylum seekers being released into the United States for the months or years it can take their deportation cases to be decided.  The Trump Administration began the program on Jan. 29 and since then 1,928 people, mostly from Central America, have been returned to Mexico to await asylum hearings.

Biden, 76, a longtime senator who served for eight years under Democratic President Barack Obama, would join a crowded field of nearly 20 other candidates seeking to defeat Republican President Donald Trump. Biden is expected to make his announcement by video and would bring an end to months of speculation about whether he would challenge Trump, who followed Obama in the White House following his 2016 victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Next Monday, Biden will meet with union workers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a pivotal state that backed Trump in 2016, the source said. Trips will follow to all four early voting states - Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada - in coming weeks, the source said, adding the details were still being completed. Biden unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 1988 and 2008. He has faced questions in recent weeks about his history of touching strangers at political events, with several women coming forward to say he had made them feel uncomfortable. Biden has said he believed he never acted inappropriately but would be more mindful about his behavior.

194,"House oversight chairman cites 'massive' obstruction by Trump, Barr - Reuters","April 24, 2019 /  7:50 PM / in 13 days","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee accused the Trump administration of a “massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction” for ordering federal employees not to comply with congressional investigations. “Both President Trump and Attorney General Barr are now openly ordering federal employees to ignore congressional subpoenas and simply not show up - without any assertion of a valid legal privilege,” U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings said in a statement. The Justice Department on Wednesday rebuffed the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which had sought to interview an official involved in the Trump administration’s decision to put a citizenship question on the 2020 U.S. Census.     The department said John Gore, a deputy assistant attorney general in the Civil Rights Division, would not participate in a deposition scheduled for Thursday if he could not have a Justice Department lawyer at his side. The committee had offered to allow a lawyer to sit in a different room. Cummings said the subpoena issued to Gore was adopted on a bipartisan basis and that there was no privilege asserted by the White House or Justice Department that would preclude him from appearing. “This is a massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction,” Cummings said, warning the federal employees to “think very carefully about their own legal interests” in refusing to comply with the panel’s requests.

197,China gives modest boost to economy with RRR cut amid renewed trade tensions - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  1:56 AM / a day ago","6 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) to release about 280 billion yuan ($41 billion) for some small and medium-sized banks, in a targeted move to help companies struggling amid an economic slowdown. The cut in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves would be the smallest since January 2018, when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) started its latest round of policy easing to support the world’s second-largest economy. The cut, while widely expected at some point, was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump sharply escalated trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies. The PBOC said the reduction will be implemented in three phases, giving the dates of May 15, June 17 and July 15. The funds will be used for loans to small and private companies. “This is aimed at helping small- and medium-sized banks to better serve small and private enterprises, which will in turn support the overall economy,” the PBOC said on its website. The central bank said it will cut the RRR for about 1,000 rural commercial banks operating in counties to 8 percent, equal to the RRR for smaller rural credit cooperatives. The move will help lower funding costs for small and micro firms, the PBOC said. Small and medium-sized banks currently have RRRs ranging from 10 percent to 11.5 percent. The PBOC has already delivered five RRR cuts since early 2018, lowering the ratio to 13.5 percent for big banks and 11.5 percent for small-to medium-sized lenders. The central bank pumped out 3.35 trillion yuan in net liquidity through the five reserve cuts, according to Reuters calculations based on PBOC data and analyst estimates. Analysts believe PBOC has less room to ease policy after it cut RRRs and interest rates aggressively during the global financial crisis, and delivered more cuts in 2012 and 2015 -  a year marked by a stock market crash and a slide in the yuan. The government, which is relying more on increased infrastructure spending and tax cuts to support economic growth this year, has repeated said it will not resort to “flood-like” stimulus. Previous policy announcements usually fell on non-trading times after the market closed, analysts from Citic Securities noted, making the timing of this announcement intriguing. Just hours earlier, Trump issued a series tweets in which he complained that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. His comments upended markets that had been enjoying a period of calm thanks to signs of robust growth in China and the United States, and from previous comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well.      Some analysts believed the PBOC was seeking to reassure investors unnerved by Trump’s latest comments. “I think it is a move to calm the market, to offset the impact from the trade talks, telling you that ‘I can give some stimulus during the most difficult times, but I will not give too much’,” said Zhou Hao, analyst at Commerzbank in Singapore, adding that the PBOC’s targeted cut showed Beijing’s resolve to keep its debt level in check. Despite the policy boost, China’s major stock indexes still extended heavy losses.  The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent.     China’s currency, the yuan, dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. “Beijing has been sounding less dovish over the past two weeks. We believe a worsening of the trade conflict between the US and China will evoke another dovish turn by Beijing, especially on its monetary easing stance,” Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. Economists had expected further targeted cuts on the RRR this year as Beijing seeks to underpin growth. The State Council, or cabinet, said on April 17 that a policy framework would be set up to implement relatively low RRRs for small- and medium-sized banks. The PBOC is likely to cut RRRs for small banks to encourage more lending to small and private firms - which are vital for economic growth and job creation - policy insiders told Reuters previously, who pencilled in at least one such “targeted” RRR cut this year. China’s Vice Premier Liu He, who was scheduled to meet U.S. officials in Washington for further trade talks this week, is “very unlikely” to go after Trump’s tariff “threat”, editor-in-chief of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Monday. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday a Chinese delegation is preparing to go to the United States for trade talks, although it did not say if Vice Premier Liu would be part of the delegation.

198,Warren Buffett says U.S.-China trade war would be 'bad for the whole world' - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  11:32 AM / in 9 hours","4 Min Read(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday that a trade war between the United States and China would be “bad for the whole world.” Buffett spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he will raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent beginning on Friday. Trump also said he would soon slap a 25-percent tariff on $325 billion of Chinese goods that have not been taxed. Major stock markets fell worldwide on Monday in response to the tweet, which preceded scheduled trade talks this week, and was a “rational” response, Buffett said on CNBC television. Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns or invests in many companies that do business in China, including Apple Inc, in which it has a more than $50 billion stake, and Chinese electric car maker BYD Co. “If we actually have a trade war it will be bad for the whole world,” Buffett said. A full-scale trade war is unlikely, he said, but “would be bad for everything Berkshire owns.” Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, also speaking on CNBC, said Trump was not “totally crazy” for wanting higher tariffs on some goods, but that a trade war would be “massively stupid.” Despite the concerns, Buffett said it would be “nonsense” for investors to sell stocks based on negative headlines, adding that the United States and China will be the world’s superpowers for the next 100 years and will always have tensions. He also said the battle would not affect how Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire operates. The company owns more than 90 companies including utilities, makers of industrial parts and chemicals, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream, and ended March with $191.8 billion of equity investments. “We will buy the same stocks today that we were buying last week,” and would be “delighted” if a good Chinese business expressed interest in a Berkshire transaction, Buffett said. Trump on Monday tweeted that the United States has for many years lost $600 billion to $800 billion annually on trade, and “with China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry, we’re not going to be doing that anymore!” Buffett said tough talk ahead of trade negotiations was understandable, saying that for some people “the best technique is to act half-crazy,” but it would be ineffective to “shake your fist first and then shake your finger later on.” He added that Trump’s planned tariffs raise the stakes for Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “You’re talking about two personalities who are very much used to getting their way in politics, and talking about how they will be perceived in their own country in terms of their behavior,” Buffett said. “It gets very complicated.” Buffett said the trade dispute has already had an effect on Berkshire’s BNSF railroad. Meanwhile, Jim Weber, the chief executive officer of Berkshire’s Brooks Running unit, said in an interview last week that his company was ending most shoe production in China and moving it to Vietnam because of tariff concerns. Buffett also said the United States should bolster its trade relations with Canada and Mexico. “We’ve got lots and lots and lots of common interests,” he said. “Trade with Mexico and Canada is enormously important. We should treat them as neighbors, and not adversaries.” Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Nick ZieminskiAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

201,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks reel as Trump tweets on China unnerve markets - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  8:39 AM / a day ago","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices) By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - European stocks tumbled to a one-month low and German bond yields slipped below zero on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, triggering a global rout in risky assets. Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. On Friday, he had cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “Everyone expected talks were heading in the right direction and almost close to finishing,” said Daniel Lenz, a rates strategist at DZ Bank in London. “This was totally out of the blue and the reaction is that we have more risk aversion today.” An index of Chinese shares  plunged more than 7 percent. U.S. stock futures fell 1.6 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan dropped to a 10-month low. MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell half a percent. Trump tweeted on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly” and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. The tweets stirred up hitherto calm markets. China’s foreign ministry said on Monday a delegation was preparing to go to United States for trade talks. Many market watchers regarded the latest episode as a negotiating tactic by Trump, but investors still pared their positions in risky assets. STOCKS FALL, BONDS RISE European stocks fell and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent, signalling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. Germany’s main stock index was down 1.8 percent. A broader index of European shares declined 1.7 percent to its lowest level since early April. Japanese and London markets were both closed for holidays, exacerbating the moves. Losses in equities translated into gains for bonds. Benchmark government bond yields in Germany retreated below zero and not far from March’s two-and-a-half-year low of minus 0.09 percent. Emerging-market currencies and commodity-linked currencies were the hardest hit. The Australian dollar fell half a percent against the U.S. dollar and the offshore yuan lost nearly a percent In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. U.S. crude dropped as much as 3.1 percent to its lowest in more than five weeks before recovering bouncing to $61.49 per barrel, still off 0.8 percent on the day. Brent crude was 0.4 percent lower at $70.57 per barrel. The selloff in risky assets led spot gold to rise 0.1 percent, to $1,279.20 per ounce.

The plan would then be presented to the European Central Bank on May 17. Maccarone said the rescue plan would see Italian banks convert into equity 313 million euros in hybrid debt they bought from Carige to prop up the lender in November 2018.

203,WRAPUP 3-China trade team still plans on U.S. talks as Trump vows to raise tariffs - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  8:56 AM / a day ago","6 Min Read* Trump says to raise U.S. tariffs on $200 bln of Chinese goods * Beijing says still trying to understand the situation * China vice premier due in Washington this week, may not go By Ben Blanchard and Jeff Mason BEIJING/WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - China said on Monday that a delegation was still preparing to go to the United States for trade talks, even as U.S. President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on Beijing to reach a deal, saying he would hike tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Trump’s comments on Sunday marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s two largest economies, and a shift in tone from the president, who as recently as Friday had cited progress toward a deal. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled on his remarks, as negotiations to end the months-long trade war were thrown into doubt. “We are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation. What I can tell you is that China’s team is preparing to go to the United States for the discussions,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a news briefing. But Geng did not say if Vice Premier Liu He, who is China’s lead official in the negotiations, will be part of the delegation as originally planned. Negotiations are set to start May 8 in Washington. “What is of vital importance is that we still hope the United States can work hard with China to meet each other half way, and strive to reach a mutually beneficial, win-win agreement on the basis of mutual respect,” Geng said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that China was considering cancelling this week’s meetings in Washington in light of Trump’s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise. Trump appeared to defend his decision in a tweet early Monday, slamming the U.S.-China trade deficit and vowing not to lose out to Beijing. A less-than-rosy update from U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some previous commitments, prompted Trump’s weekend decision. “The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Trump said in a tweet. Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at 10 percent due to progress between the two sides. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly,” essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. U.S. officials did not weigh in on whether they expected talks to go ahead this week. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The atmosphere of the negotiations has changed,” said a Chinese official with knowledge of the situation. Whether and how the talks proceed are being re-evaluated, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “All that depends on the attitude of the United States,” the official said. Chinese news outlets have been told not to independently report on Trump’s tweets, and instead adhere to any report from the official Xinhua news agency, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Global financial markets, which had been expecting news of a trade deal soon, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled. China’s main indexes slid 5 percent. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets.” Mindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump had also suggested the duties were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. “The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,” he tweeted. Tariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by companies that import the goods, and most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while supportive of Trump’s crackdown on China’s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded. “Raising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,” said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Nevertheless, the president’s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to “hang tough” in a tweet: “Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.” One Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence. “The urgency is gone. So, it’s likely to see a longer trade war,” the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. The trade war resulted in billions of dollars in losses for both sides in 2018, hitting autos, technology and above all, agriculture, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. On Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well. Last week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the end game, but a Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained. The increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday would be the first since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year. Negotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be removed, while Trump wants to keep some, if not all, as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.

205,House panel to vote on holding White House ex-official in contempt - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  1:55 PM / in 14 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. House committee will vote on holding a former White House security director in contempt for failing to appear for questioning on allegations the Trump administration inappropriately granted clearances to some of the president’s advisers, the panel’s chairman said on Tuesday. “We will hold a vote of our committee shortly to hold him in contempt and then we will check with House counsel ... to see where we go from there,” House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings said in an interview with MSNBC. The Democratic lawmaker did not specify a date. Carl Kline, who served as the White House personnel security chief for the first two years of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency and now works for the Department of Defense, had been called to appear before the committee at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT). The White House told the committee it had directed Kline to ignore the subpoena, the panel said in a statement, but Trump did not assert “any Constitutional or other privilege that would have relieved Mr. Kline of his legal obligation to testify.” A lawyer for Kline also told the panel he would not appear. Lawmakers have three ways to enforce a subpoena against  uncooperative subjects, the Congressional Research Service said in a 2017 report, including using its “long dormant” power to detain and imprison them until they comply, referring a contempt citation to the executive branch for criminal prosecution or seeking a civil judgment from a U.S. court.  Cummings had led the push to subpoena Kline amid the panel’s investigation into the security clearance process under Trump following whistleblower allegations that the White House  overruled career officials’ decisions and granted security clearances to certain advisers.      Congressional sources have said those advisers included Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both serve as top White House officials. The vote to subpoena Kline passed the Democratic-led committee earlier this month, 22-15, along party lines. On Monday, Trump sued the committee to fight a separate subpoena for his financial records.

206,Treasury's Mnuchin misses congressional deadline to hand over Trump tax returns - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  10:11 AM / 14 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline on Tuesday for turning over President Donald Trump’s tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration. The outcome, which was widely expected, could prompt House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to subpoena Trump’s tax records as the opening salvo to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Neal set a final 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) deadline for the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury to provide six years of Trump’s individual and business tax records. But the deadline passed without the panel receiving the documents. After the deadline lapsed, Mnuchin released a letter to Neal in which he pledged to make “a final decision” on whether to provide Trump’s tax records by May 6. It was the second time the administration had missed a House deadline for the tax returns since Neal requested them on April 3.   “Secretary Mnuchin notified me that once again, the IRS will miss the deadline for my ... request. I plan to consult with counsel about my next steps,” Neal said in a statement.  In his letter, Mnuchin said he was still consulting with the Justice Department about Neal’s request, which he termed “unprecedented.” “The department cannot act upon your request unless and until it is determined to be consistent with the law,” the Treasury secretary told Neal. Democrats want Trump’s returns as part of their investigations of possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests, even as he serves the public as president. Republicans have condemned the request as a political “fishing expedition” by Democrats.   Trump broke with a decades-old precedent by refusing to release his tax returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 or since being elected, saying he could not do so while his taxes were being audited.  But his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, told a House panel in February that he did not believe Trump’s taxes were under audit. Cohen said the president feared that releasing his returns could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties. Earlier on Tuesday, the White House said Trump was unlikely to hand over his tax returns. “As I understand it, the president’s pretty clear: Once he’s out of audit, he’ll think about doing it, but he’s not inclined to do so at this time,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News in an interview. “This is not up to the president. We did not ask him,” said a Democratic committee aide, who cited a law saying the Treasury secretary “shall furnish” taxpayer data upon request from an authorized lawmaker.  Neal informed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig earlier this month that failure to comply with the deadline would be viewed as a denial. Legal experts said House Democrats could vote to hold Mnuchin or Rettig in contempt of Congress if they ignored a subpoena, as a pretext to suing in federal court to obtain Trump’s returns. Experts say administration officials could ultimately risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee.    As Ways and Means chairman, Neal is the only lawmaker in the House of Representatives authorized to request taxpayer information under federal law. Democrats say they are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump’s tax returns. “Secretary Mnuchin is again choosing to violate the law to keep Trump’s records hidden away. This administration’s contempt for rule of law is without peer,” Representative Bill Pascrell, who has been leading the Democratic push for Trump’s tax records, said in a statement on Twitter. “I stand beside @RepRichardNeal as he continues the crusade to impose plain oversight on this corrupt administration.” Despite the law’s clarity, Democrats have long acknowledged that the effort would likely result in a legal battle that could end up with the Supreme Court. “If the IRS does not comply with the request, it is likely that Chairman Neal will subpoena the returns,” Representative Judy Chu, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, told Reuters.   “If they do not comply with that (subpoena), a legal battle will begin to defend the right of oversight in Congress,” she said.

207,Supreme Court poised to give Trump victory on census citizenship question - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  10:18 AM / 14 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority on Tuesday appeared poised to hand President Donald Trump a victory on his administration’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, a move opponents call a Republican effort to deter immigrants from taking part. Conservative justices signaled during arguments in the closely watched case a willingness to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the question and appeared untroubled by the administration’s stated justification for using the citizenship question in the decennial population count. Their liberal counterparts expressed hostility toward allowing the question. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority and has backed Trump in other high-profile cases. Conservative justices indicated a citizenship question would be eminently reasonable, noting that other countries use such questions and that the United States has done so in the past in one form or another. Among the conservative justices indicating support for the administration’s stance were Trump’s two appointees, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and Chief Justice John Roberts, considered the court’s pivotal vote. Opponents have said the question would cause a sizeable undercount by frightening immigrant households and Latinos from filling out the census forms, fearful that the information would be shared with law enforcement. This would cost Democratic-leaning areas electoral representation in Congress and federal aid, benefiting Trump’s fellow Republicans and Republican-leaning parts of the country, they said. The census is used to allot seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and distribute some $800 billion in federal funds. Lower courts ruled that the administration violated federal law and the U.S. Constitution in seeking to include the question on the census form. A ruling by the Supreme Court is due by the end of June. During about 80 minutes of arguments, Roberts and other conservative justices appeared to accept the administration’s argument that the question would yield better data to enforce the Voting Rights Act, which protects eligible voters from discrimination. Roberts told New York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, whose state sued to block the question, that citizenship data is critical for enforcing the Voting Rights Act and said it was “quite common” for the census to capture demographic details.  Kavanaugh said it is a “very common question” internationally, and that federal law gives Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department includes the Census Bureau, “huge discretion” in how the survey is conducted. The Supreme Court already has handed Trump some major victories, including upholding his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries in June 2018. The court in January let Trump’s policy barring many transgender people from the U.S. military to go into effect.  The census case comes in a pair of lawsuits by a group of states and localities led by New York state, and a coalition of immigrant rights groups challenging the legality of the question. The census forms are due to be printed in the coming months. Liberal justices noted evidence presented by the Census Bureau’s own experts that showed the citizenship question would lead to a population undercount, and, contrary to the administration’s stated goal, less accurate citizenship data.  They also voiced skepticism about the administration’s Voting Rights Act justification. “You can’t read the record without sensing that this need is a contrived one,” liberal Justice Elena Kagan said.  “This is a solution in search of a problem,” added liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court’s only Hispanic justice. Sotomayor, who tangled with Trump administration’s lawyer Noel Francisco during the argument, said there was “no doubt” the question would drive down the census response rate. But Gorsuch and fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito challenged evidence that inquiring about citizenship could lower response rates. Gorsuch noted that “it’s not like this question is improper to ask.” Francisco argued that Ross acted properly within his discretion in deciding to add the question, adding, “It really does boil down to whether the secretary’s judgment here is a reasonable one.” Citizenship has not been asked of all households since the 1950 census. It has featured since then on questionnaires sent to a smaller subset of the population. While only U.S. citizens can vote, non-citizens comprise an estimated 7 percent of the population.  Manhattan-based U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman on Jan. 15   ruled that the Commerce Department’s decision to add the question violated a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act. Federal judges in Maryland and California also prohibited the question’s inclusion in subsequent rulings, saying it would violate the Constitution’s mandate to enumerate the population every 10 years. The Census Bureau estimated that households corresponding to 6.5 million people would not respond to the census if the citizenship question is asked.  Immigrant advocacy groups rallied outside the court after the argument, with demonstrators carrying signs reading “no census without us” and “fair and accurate count for all.”  U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who represents part of New York City, said, “I hope the justices feel strongly that the Constitution should be upheld, that the science should be upheld, and that the experts should be listened to.” For a graphic on the major Supreme Court cases this term: tmsnrt.rs/2V2T0Uf Reporting by Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

209,US STOCKS-Futures tumble as Trump's China tariff threat rattles investors - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:36 PM / a day ago","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. to raise tariffs on $200 bln worth Chinese goods-Trump * Tariff-sensitive Boeing, chipmakers fall * 29 of 30 Dow components trade lower premarket * Futures drop: Dow 1.81%, S&P 1.62%, Nasdaq 2.02% (Changes comment, updates prices) By Amy Caren Daniel May 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open sharply lower on Monday after President Donald Trump in a surprising move threatened to hike tariffs on Chinese goods this week, reigniting fears of a global slowdown and shattering a period of relative calm in markets. Trump said on Sunday tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at 10 percent as the two sides made progress on trade talks. The Wall Street Journal reported China was considering canceling a round of U.S. talks set for this week in the wake of Trump’s comments, but China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States. Of the 30 Dow components, 29 were down premarket. Boeing Co , the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 2.7%, while chipmakers, which get a good portion of their revenue from China, tumbled. “I don’t think it was done so flippantly to suggest Trump will not follow through with it, but there is an element of it being a negotiation tactic,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “These things are used as an excuse for investors to take profits because we have had such an enormous rally and valuations are relatively high and the impetus was on news to continue to be good and obviously this is not welcome news.” Investors stepped back from riskier assets as hopes of a deal have helped markets surge this year, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes hitting record highs last week. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked to its highest level in nearly two months. At 7:57 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 479 points, or 1.81%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 47.75 points, or 1.62% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 158.5 points, or 2.02%. Semiconductor stocks Nvidia Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Intel Corp fell between 2.2% and 4%. Marquee names such as Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Netflix Inc were down between 1.7% and 2.7%. Automakers General Motors Co declined 2.7%, while Ford Motor dropped 2.5%. Tesla Inc slipped 1.9%, also weighed down by U.S. trade officials rejecting the company’s bid for relief from tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot “brain” of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles. In a bright spot, Anadarko Petroleum Corp rose 2.6% after Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp . The oil major was up 0.2%, the only gainer among Dow components.

213,Hedge fund Marcato opposes Acreage's sale to cannabis producer Canopy - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:06 PM / a day ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Hedge fund Marcato Capital Management said on Monday it opposed marijuana company Acreage Holdings Inc’s $3.4 billion sale to rival Canopy Growth Corp, arguing Acreage was too hasty in agreeing to a deal at too low a price. Marcato, which owns 2.7 percent of Acreage, wrote to the company’s board of directors to argue that the proposed takeover, which was agreed to last month and will be voted on by shareholders next month, is “lopsided in Canopy’s favor.” “It is highly imprudent for Acreage to sell itself today at the proposed valuation, with so much unlocked growth and value embedded in the Company,” Marcato portfolio manager Mick McGuire wrote in the letter seen by Reuters. In April, Smiths Falls, Ontario-based Canopy said it would pay $3.4 billion in cash and stock for New York-headquartered Acreage, giving Acreage investors $300 million in cash upfront. Acreage shareholders will also receive Canopy shares at a later date, when marijuana use is legalized at a federal level in the United States. While medical and recreational marijuana use is permitted in many U.S. states, it is still prohibited by federal law, and the deal could be called off if marijuana use does not become legal across the country in the next 7-1/2 years. Since the announcement, Canopy’s stock price has jumped 15 percent while Acreage’s shares have dropped 6 percent. On Friday, Acreage’s stock closed at $22 a share, below the $25 per share price of its initial public offering last November, and far below sell side analysts’ stock price targets of $31 to $42 a share. “Canopy’s market capitalization has increased by roughly  $3.5 billion since the deal announcement, indicating pro forma economic value to Canopy of $6.9 billion — over 100 percent greater than the price offered to Acreage shareholders,” the letter said. Marcato is speaking up about the planned takeover days before the May 13 record date when shareholders become eligible to cast their vote and will spearhead opposition when they vote on June 19. McGuire urged Acreage’s board, which is stocked with well-connected former politicians including former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and John Boehner, a former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, to wait. “Remain independent” and “run a formal and competitive sale process”, the letter said, noting that once the regulatory landscape in the cannabis sector clears, other bidders including tobacco and spirits companies could make offers.

214,"RPT-COLUMN-Funds dig deeper into bearish CBOT bets as heavy stocks, trade war weigh -Braun - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  11:31 AM / a day ago","6 Min Read(Repeats item published earlier with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Karen Braun FORT COLLINS, Colo., May 5 (Reuters) - Heavy world stocks, trade conflicts, and demand disruptions have led speculators to end April on a record bearish note across Chicago-traded grains and oilseeds, and a sharp reversal in investor attitude anytime soon seems unlikely. When combining money managers' net positions in CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, along with Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat, the overall net short reached 683,501 futures and options contracts as of April 30, up from 656,078 a week prior, which was the previous record. (tmsnrt.rs/2LqH2DO) The agriculture market has been grappling with record U.S. soybean stocks and rising corn stocks, an excellent U.S. wheat crop, and strong export competition among major world suppliers for all three products. Feed demand in China, which imports massive quantities of soybeans for its hog herd, has recently been disappointing as the country is battling an outbreak of deadly African swine fever. Market participants have been hopeful that a potential trade resolution between the United States and China might be able to cure tumbling CBOT futures, but those hopes were blasted on Sunday as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions by saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. This comes after many months of headlines saying the trade talks were going well and that a resolution could be reached soon. Beijing was unimpressed with Trump’s ideas and as of late Sunday night, China’s Vice Premier Liu He was considering cancelling his planned trip to the United States this week to continue trade talks. Markets reacted harshly to this news. Early in overnight trade from Sunday to Monday, July corn futures were down as much as 15 cents per bushel and July soybeans dropped up to 20 cents. Drier forecasts for the U.S. Corn Belt heading into mid-month also weighed on futures overnight. Heavy, persistent rains have halted a large portion of U.S. fieldwork, causing concerns that the corn crop may not get planted to full intentions. In the week ended April 30, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short position in CBOT corn futures and options to 306,699 contracts from a record 322,215 in the prior week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPjxhe) On the other end of the spectrum, producers cut their net long in corn to 12,527 futures and options contracts from a record 47,097 a week earlier. This is only the fourth week ever, and fourth in a row, that producers held a bullish stance in the yellow grain, and this continues to cap rally potential should funds decide to cover their short positions. Wet weather across the U.S. Corn Belt has delayed the planting of the crop in many key states such as Illinois. This led to a modest rise in CBOT corn futures from Wednesday through Friday, and commodity funds were presumed to be straight buyers of the grain during that time. Meanwhile, funds were likely straight sellers of CBOT soybean futures over the last three sessions. Significant planting delays for U.S. corn can often lead to a rise in soybean plantings, which along with the U.S.-China trade war and record stockpiles did not create positive sentiments among investors. Through April 30, money managers' net short in soybeans hit a new record of 148,526 futures and options contracts. That compares with 129,566 contracts in the previous week, and that was a record at the time. (tmsnrt.rs/2DQMhq2) Similar to corn, producers are loaded up on soybeans, which would not be supportive of a drastic futures rally should fundamentals unexpectedly turn positive. Producers’ net long in soybean futures and options rose to 69,145 contracts from 63,510 a week earlier. The new position is about 10,000 contracts below producers’ record net long. Funds also hit new record bearish bets in Kansas City wheat futures and options through April 30. The net short of 58,494 contracts is up from 53,673 in the previous week and tops the old record of 54,295 contracts set two weeks earlier. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPk2I8) K.C. July wheat futures rose nearly 2 percent over the last three sessions after Tuesday’s contract lows, but they had fallen back down near those lows early in Sunday night’s trading. Money managers extended their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 83,502 contracts through April 30, their most bearish wheat view in 15 months. They also added 43 futures and options contracts to their net short in Minneapolis wheat, which hit 12,609 contracts. That is funds’ most bearish spring wheat stance since July. Speculators’ moves in the soy complex through April 30 were not very dramatic. Money managers extended their net short in soybean oil to 58,072 futures and options contracts from 50,637 in the previous week, and they cut their net short in soybean meal to 15,599 contracts from 19,429 a week earlier. Trade sources predict that commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT wheat, net sellers of soybean meal, and straight sellers of soybean oil between Wednesday and Friday.

Bigbasket, which sells everything from groceries and fresh produce to pet food, competes with  Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc’s e-commerce unit Flipkart in many categories.  Supermarket Grocery Supplies Private Ltd, which owns Bigbasket, will use the proceeds for expansion and to scale up the online grocer’s supply chain, the company said. Launched in 2011, Bigbasket operates across 25 Indian cities.

Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund and Alibaba were joined by the UK government’s development finance institution, CDC Group, in the funding round, Bigbasket said.  Alibaba became the biggest shareholder in Bigbasket last year, after it led a $300 million funding round in the company, stepping up its competition with Amazon.

217,Warren Buffett says trade war would be 'bad for the whole world' - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  11:26 AM / a day ago","3 Min ReadMay 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday that a trade war between the United States and China would be “bad for the whole world.” Buffett spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he will raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent beginning on Friday, and “shortly” slap a 25 percent tariff on $325 billion of Chinese goods that have not been taxed. Major stock markets fell worldwide on Monday in response to the president’s tweet, which was a “rational” response, Buffett said on CNBC television. His conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns or invests in many companies that do business in China, including Apple Inc in which it has a more than $50 billion stake. “If we actually have a trade war it will be bad for the whole world,” Buffett said. “With some people in negotiations, the best technique is to act half-crazy.” A full-scale trade war “would be bad for everything Berkshire owns,” Buffett added, though the probability it might happen is low. Buffett said tough talk ahead of negotiations was understandable, but that it was ineffective to “shake your fist first and then shake your finger later on.” He added that Trump’s threat raises the stakes for Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “You’re talking about two personalities who are very much used to getting their way in politics, and talking about how they will be perceived in their own country in terms of their behavior,” he said. “It gets very complicated.” Buffett said the trade dispute has already had an effect on Berkshire’s BNSF railroad. Last week, Jim Weber, the chief executive officer of Berkshire’s Brooks Running unit, said in an interview that his company was ending most of its shoe production in China and moving it to Vietnam because of tariff concerns. Buffett nonetheless said the problems will not affect how Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire operates. “We will buy the same stocks today that we were buying last week,” he said. Berkshire ended March with $191.8 billion of equity investments. It also owns more than 90 companies including energy and utility companies, the Geico auto insurer and the Dairy Queen ice cream chain.

218,Trump's tax law to boost incomes more in Republican states: researchers - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  6:35 PM / 14 days ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A 2017 tax overhaul championed by President Donald Trump will cut household taxes more in Republican-leaning states than in states that lean Democratic, according to research published by the U.S. central bank on Tuesday. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act, signed by Trump in December 2017, reduced tax rates for most Americans, boosting economic growth in 2018 while widening the federal budget deficit.  Trump has often cited the legislation one of his key achievements, although critics say the law mostly cuts taxes for high-income Americans and corporations. Many Americans are also getting smaller tax refunds or owed money than in the past. The tax law’s long-term effects will include pushing after-tax incomes 1.6 percent higher in states that tend to vote for Trump’s Republican party, compared to a 1.3 percent gain in Democratic-leaning states, according to research published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, one of 12 regional branches of the U.S. central bank. Households in Democratic-leaning states get less help because the law makes it harder to deduct state and local tax bills from a household’s federal obligations. State and local taxes tend to be higher in states that lean Democratic. The researchers, which included Atlanta Fed economist David Altig and University of California, Berkeley economist Alan Auerbach, considered states to be leaning Republican or Democratic if one party’s share of the vote averaged at least 5 percentage points higher than that of the other party in the last five presidential elections.  For their estimates, the researchers assumed the tax overhaul would be made permanent. Congress, which was Republican-controlled when the bill was passed, made many of the tax cuts expire after 10 years so that the legislation could pass without Democratic support.

219,Kushner says Mueller probe damaged U.S. more than Russia did - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  6:14 PM / 14 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - White House advisor and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner said on Tuesday that Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 election harmed U.S. democracy more than Moscow’s interference did.  “You look at what Russia did, buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent and do it, and it’s a terrible thing. But I think the investigations and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple of Facebook ads,” Kushner said at a Time magazine forum in New York. Mueller, in a redacted report made public last week, found that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election “in sweeping and systematic fashion,” favoring Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The Russians bought Facebook ads but the report also detailed other tactics such as hacking and leaking Democratic Party emails and outreach to the Trump campaign, including a meeting with Kushner and other campaign officials. Democrats in Congress are debating whether to start impeachment proceedings against Trump for possible obstruction of justice.  The president and leaders in the Republican Party say the report vindicated Trump. Mueller outlined multiple instances where Trump tried to thwart the probe. The special counsel did not conclude that Trump had committed a crime but neither did he exonerate the president. Mueller also did not conclude that there was a conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia.  “Great interview by Jared. Nice to have extraordinarily smart people serving our Country!” Trump said on Twitter, linking to Time’s video of Kushner’s appearance. Kushner said the Trump campaign was unaware of the scope of Russia’s efforts, saying, “the notion of what they were doing didn’t even register to us as being impactful.” The report detailed multiple Russian contacts with the Trump campaign, many of them reported by the media over the past two years. “When the whole notion of the Russian collusion narrative came up, I was the first person to say I’m happy to participate with any investigations. I thought the whole thing was kind of nonsense, to be honest with you,” said Kushner, who was interviewed by Mueller’s investigators. The Russians created and maintained fake social media personas posing as Americans to influence the election, and bought Facebook ads to reach more people, the report found. “I think they said they spent about $160,000,” Kushner said. “I spent about $160,000 on Facebook every three hours during the campaign.”                 Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Alistair BellAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

220,Israeli minister condemns Sanders' remarks on 'racist' Netanyahu government - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  5:35 PM / in 14 days","3 Min ReadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli cabinet minister condemned U.S. Democratic Party presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Tuesday for describing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government as racist over its treatment of Palestinians. While enjoying unprecedentedly strong backing from the Republican administration of President Donald Trump, some Israelis have been fretting about whether this comes at the cost of losing traditionally bipartisan support in Washington. Addressing a televised CNN event alongside other Democratic candidates on Monday, Vermont senator Sanders said he was “100 percent pro-Israel” but proposed changing U.S. policy toward it. “The goal must be to try to bring people together and not just support one country, which is now run by a right-wing, dare I say, racist government,” Sanders said, adding that Netanyahu “is treating the Palestinian people extremely unfairly”. Netanyahu was reelected to a fifth term on April 9 and appears likely to build a coalition government including religious ultranationalists opposed to Palestinian statehood. “We condemn statements like that made by Sanders, which was really strange,” Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister in Netanyahu’s outgoing cabinet and senior member of his conservative Likud party, told Israel’s Reshet 13 TV.  “The Israeli government is not a racist government, nor does it include a single racist minister,” the regional cooperation minister said. “To be right wing is not illegitimate and it is odd that the Democratic Party allows one of its senior members to not respect the democratic choice of the State of Israel.”   Hanegbi cast his own remarks as specific to Sanders rather than any more generalized criticism of the Democratic Party.  Asked whether Israel risked being seen in the United States as a country championed by Republicans, he said: “We make every effort to avoid this danger because, indeed one of Israel’s greatest advantages over all the years was the ability not to get caught up in the political dispute between the parties.” U.S. Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic, studies show, a trend that political analysts say has also contributed to a degree of grassroots disconnect between the allies since Trump’s rise. Sanders is himself Jewish and, in his CNN appearance, noted his past visits to, and relatives living in, Israel.

221,Euro zone investor morale rises in May as recession fears fade - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  8:37 AM / a day ago","2 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - Investor morale in the euro zone improved in May for the third month in a row to hit its highest level since November 2018, helped by a buoyant global environment and the danger of a disorderly Brexit being averted until October. The Sentix research group said on Monday its investor sentiment index for the euro zone rose to 5.3 in May from -0.3 in April. Analysts had expected a reading of 1.4. “In May, the economic situation continued to improve globally, but also in Europe. Fears of a recession are thus receding into the background,” Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner said in a statement. A sub-index on euro zone expectations improved for the fourth month in a row, reaching -0.3, its highest level since March last year. A current situation index rose to 11.0 from 3.8. Investor morale also improved in Germany, with an investor sentiment index for Europe’s largest economy rising to 7.9 - its highest since November 2018 - from 2.1 in April. “Apparently, the spark from the Chinese economy, which has recovered significantly since the start of the year, is increasingly jumping over to the export-dependent German economy,” Huebner said.

222,Malaysia sends ex-Goldman banker to U.S. to face 1MDB charges -report - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:54 AM / a day ago","3 Min ReadKUALA LUMPUR, May 6 (Reuters) - Malaysia has extradited a former Goldman Sachs banker to the United States to face criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, The Edge financial daily reported on Monday, citing an unidentified source. Malaysian Roger Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against him for allegedly laundering funds diverted from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund. He left Goldman Sachs in 2014. Ng had agreed to be sent to the United States, but the proceedings were delayed after Malaysia’s home minister said he should first face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation. Malaysian and U.S. authorities, however, agreed last week to extradite Ng to the United States, The Edge reported. “I can confirm that he left last Friday and is now in the U.S. under the watch of the DoJ,” the daily quoted the source as saying. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment. Ng’s lawyer was unavailable for comment. A prosecutor working on Ng’s case, who asked not to be identified as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, said the attorney general would release a statement on Ng’s status soon. Goldman Sachs is under scrutiny for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. The DoJ has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise. Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used. Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales. He was also charged in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law targeting official bribery abroad. Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB funds. Leissner has pleaded guilty. Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak. Najib, who lost a general election last year, is facing 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

223,"RPT-WRAPUP 3-China stocks fall most in over 3 years on tariff threats, yuan tumbles - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  7:39 AM / a day ago","6 Min Read(Repeats to additional codes. No change to text.) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes fell the most in more than three years. The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Around 1,000 mainland firms plummet the maximum allowed 10 percent daily limit. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. The yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilise the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares have surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike in 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung.

225,European shares dive as U.S.-China tensions escalate - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:34 AM / a day ago","3 Min Read(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) May 6 (Reuters) - European shares fell sharply on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly ratcheted up trade tensions between the world’s largest economies by vowing to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by this week, prompting investors to flee riskier assets. Germany’s DAX – the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - and France’s CAC led declines, down 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent respectively. The pan-European STOXX 600 index shed 1.2 percent by 0720 GMT, its steepest fall in six weeks. Bourses in Italy, Spain and France also fell more than 1 percent while markets in Britain remained shut for a bank holiday. Hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal have partly been the reason for the strong rally in equities this year, with most country indices recovering from a major rout last year and hitting multi-month highs. Oil prices slumped and Asian shares took a beating after Trump, in an unexpected move to mount pressure on China, said on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. Auto stocks’ 3 percent slump led broad based declines among European sectors. In a relatively light day for earnings, dealmaking was in focus. French energy major Total said it had reached a binding agreement with Occidental to acquire Anadarko assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa for a consideration of $8.8 billion. Telecom was another sector of interest as Norway’s Telenor said it is in negotiations with Malaysia’s Axiata Group to form a telecoms holding company. Telenor shares rose 3.8 percent. ThyssenKrupp lost 3.3 percent after the company said it still saw scope for agreement with European antitrust regulators on a planned joint venture with Tata Steel despite a report that Brussels was likely to block the deal. Chipmaker stocks AMS, STMicro and Siltronic , which are highly sensitive to trade war news, lost between 3.2 to 6.4 percent. Luxembourg-based auto supplier Stabilus slid after the company cut its full-year guidance on account of the ongoing weakness in the global auto industry. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday stepped up calls for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a cross-party deal to leave the European Union, following poor results for both parties in local elections on Thursday.

226,FOREX-Yuan leads losers as global risk appetite sours - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:34 AM / in a day","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - The Chinese yuan was set for its biggest drop in 10 months on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China while perceived safe-haven currencies such as the yen surged amid a broad-based rout for risky assets. In a surprise twist, Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, marking a big shift in tone from him. Trum had cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. That caught markets off guard, especially coming during a time of low market volatility across asset classes and a recent swathe of economic data that has indicated tepid but steady expansion of the global economy. “This has the potential to upset the global risk applecart especially after the recent calm in markets,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX & EM research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The Chinese currency led losers, falling nearly a percent to near its lowest levels this year around the 6.80 per dollar line. Both the Mexican peso and the Turkish lira fell by more than half a percent each. Other currencies, whose fortunes are closely linked to the Chinese economy, such as the Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollar, declined between 0.3 to 0.5 percent. The selloff wasn’t limited to currencies alone, with a gauge of European equities down nearly 2 percent in early trading. Moves were exaggerated with London markets out for a local holiday while Japanese markets remained shut. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. Away from the weakness in the Chinese yuan and other emerging market currencies such as the Turkish lira, the dollar was broadly stable against a basket of currencies. Investors weighed the prospects of a likely inflationary boost to the U.S. economy if Trump pressed ahead with higher tariffs on imported goods coinciding with growing expectations of a U.S. interest rate later in the year.

Some losses were recouped when the South China Morning Post reported China Vice-Premier Liu He would travel to Washington on Thursday after a delay, rather than cancelling planned talks altogether. However, the SCMP later said no decision had been made on the trip and it might indeed be cancelled, leaving the market guessing. In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump announced he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The Twitter message marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to the Middle East to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.720 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China was back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen before steadying to 123.93. The single currency was calm against the dollar at $1.1190, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.567. The dollar climbed 0.8 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.7825 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 5.8 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960 before steadying to $0.6994. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets,” he added. As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.5 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.2 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Simon Cameron-Moore)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

229,Investors return to EZ safe havens as Trump piles pressure on China - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  7:21 AM / in a day","3 Min Read* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr By Virginia Furness LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Core euro zone bonds yields fell and Italian debt led a sell-off in the periphery on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday, and renewed the bid for safe haven assets. Global equity markets fell, with China’s main indexes down five percent, while Treasuries rallied after Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would rise on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”, essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region, went negative for the first time since April 30, down 2.4 basis points on the day to -0.002 percent. Most other core 10-year yields in the bloc fell around two basis points,. Italian government bonds underperformed the rest of the periphery with renewed concerns about the stability of the Italian government adding to worries about global trade. Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement raised pressure on its government partner, the League, on Sunday to dump a junior minister under investigation for corruption - a case that could pull the coalition apart. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio said on Monday a graft case involving a junior minister from the ruling League party would trigger a government crisis only if the League itself pushed for it. Italy’s short-dated bonds were up to six basis points higher in early trade before pulling back as the session wore on, while the spread of its 10-year debt over Germany widened to nearly 260 basis points for the first time since April 30. The euro zone will report final service PMI numbers for April later in the session. March data showed business activity across the bloc to be lethargic, dipping to 51.6. A Reuters poll expects the April reading to come in at 51.3. On Friday the U.S. economy showed signs of sustained strength with job growth surging in April, while unemployment fell to the lowest in nearly 50 years. However, wage gains did not accelerate, and the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by people leaving the labour force.

230,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares, oil drop after Trump tariff threat - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  6:20 AM / a day ago","6 Min Read* MSCI Asia ex-Japan sinks 1.9 pct * European shares seen following suit; London closed * Trump tweets tariff hike on Chinese goods due Friday * China blue-chips drop more than 6 pct despite targeted RRR cut * Safe-haven yen jumps, China’s yuan plummets * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Global financial markets reeled on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Equity markets, which have been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon, fell sharply as further talks to end their bruising trade war were thrown into doubt. The trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Chinese shares plunged more than 6 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 1.6 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan weakened sharply. The rout is set to continue in Europe. Financial spreadbetters expect Frankfurt’s DAX to open 1.7 percent lower at 12,207, and Paris’ CAC to open down 1.6 percent at 5,462. London is closed for a bank holiday. Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. Conflicting later reports on Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s travel plans added to market confusion. “I think this has got the potential to be a real game-changer,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets,” he said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1.9 percent in afternoon trade as markets across the region fell deep into the red. Chinese blue-chips were down more than 6 percent, having closed higher before a three-day national holiday amid expectations that pressures on China’s economy were easing. The drop in Chinese shares came despite a move on Monday by China’s central bank to cut reserve requirements for small banks to help boost lending to small and private firms. Australian shares were off 0.8 percent. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures were down 1.9 percent at 22,075, off the day’s lows. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.6 percent, erasing memories of gains on Friday after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street, and signalling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. “The risk for (Trump) is that the Chinese don’t play ball and don’t go ahead with the negotiation,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. “It’s not in his interest for shares to go down as it would hit U.S. business confidence and investment, and that would shoot up unemployment. And that would be a risk for his re-election, too,” he said. But economists at Citi painted a brighter picture of the outlook for Chinese markets following the recent stabilisation of the Chinese economy. “Should trade tensions resume, we expect a speedy reaction by China’s policy-makers, with policy implementation made more effective. Given the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus is large in the near term, we believe the negative impact from additional tariffs will likely be managed better this time,” they said in a note. The flight from riskier assets boosted interest in safe havens, pushing U.S. Treasury futures up 16 ticks. Data from CME Group showed the market now sees a nearly 56 percent chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut by the end of the year. Chinese 10-year treasury futures also jumped, with the most-traded contract, for June delivery rising as much as  0.5 percent. They were last up 0.27 percent at 96.855. “The intensified trade and geopolitical risks are likely to prompt the regional central banks for more stimulatory policies,” analysts at ING said in a note. “We expect the majority of Asian central banks meeting this week to cut their policy rates.” As investors flocked to the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.3 percent against the Japanese currency to 110.78 . But China’s yuan plunged, with the offshore unit weakening to 6.8215 per dollar, its weakest level since January 10, before paring some losses. The onshore yuan weakened nearly 1 percent to 6.7980 per dollar before bouncing back to 6.7805. In contrast to the sharp moves in Asian currencies, the euro was down less than 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1193, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.06 percent at 97.579. In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.51 per barrel - still off 2.3 percent on the day. Brent crude was 2.2 percent lower at $69.28 per barrel. The tweets have compounded pressure on prices amid signs of a rise in U.S. output, which has surged by more than 2 million barrels per day since early 2018. Spot gold jumped 0.25 percent to trade at $1,282.20 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Additional reporting by Swati

231,Mexico flags U.S. border delays as harmful to both countries - Reuters,"April 23, 2019 /  1:42 AM / in 14 days","2 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday that speeding up the flow of goods on the U.S. border is a matter of urgency and that slowdowns are detrimental to both economies, after bottlenecks have held up trade following a row over migration.  Delays along the U.S.-Mexico border began late last month after U.S. border agents were moved to handle an influx of migrants, slowing the flow of both goods and people.  The staffing shortages came shortly after President Donald Trump threatened to close the border if Mexico did not halt a surge of people seeking asylum in the United States.  Mexico’s Foreign Ministry will present a report to the United States on Thursday detailing the economic costs of the delays, a spokesman said.  “Slowing the flow of goods and the transit of people is a detriment to our economies and for the region’s competitiveness,” the ministry said in a statement.  “There is urgent need to improve the transport of goods, as well as deepen mutual cooperation to ensure the efficiency and safety of our common border.”   The Ministry noted that Mexico overtook China to become the top U.S. trade partner in January and February, amid Trump’s trade wars.  Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, spoke with northern border states on Monday in preparing to demonstrate to Washington the “cost and uselessness” of holding up border traffic, he said on Twitter.      The collective losses for companies that rely on cross-border supply chains have reached into the millions. Nearly 30 companies in Ciudad Juarez, on the opposite side of the border from El Paso, Texas, reported losses of $15 million in a single week in early April.  Ebrard previously said that U.S. officials pledged to help improve the flow of commercial traffic.

232,House panel chair subpoenas ex-White House counsel McGahn on Mueller inquiry - Reuters,"April 22, 2019 /  9:20 PM / 15 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the panel in its investigation of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump. In a statement, Nadler, a Democrat, said the committee had asked for documents from McGahn by May 7 and for him to testify on May 21. An attorney for McGahn was not immediately available for comment. A report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller publicly released on Thursday by the Justice Department said Trump asked McGahn to fire Mueller as he was investigating suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Moscow officials. “Mr. McGahn is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report,” Nadler said.  Mueller’s report said that the 22-month investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russians but Mueller did find “multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.”  The top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Doug Collins, said it was premature to issue a subpoena. “Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced,” Collins said in a statement. Nadler said Mueller’s report “outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses.” He said “it now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.” According to the Mueller report, Trump directed McGahn in June 2017 to tell the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Rod Rosenstein, that Mueller had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the order. Reporting by Eric Beech and David Morgan; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and Grant McCoolAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

233,"On staff following orders, Trump says: 'Nobody disobeys me' - Reuters","April 22, 2019 /  5:11 PM / 15 days ago","3 Min ReadBy David Alexander and Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump dismissed questions from reporters on Monday about his staff’s reluctance to carry out his orders and the chances of impeachment proceedings in the U.S. Congress, days after the Mueller report highlighted both issues. The 448-page report from U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election revealed staff and associates sometimes ignored requests from Trump to deliver messages, including one to fire Mueller. “Nobody disobeys me,” Republican Trump said when asked if he was worried about his orders not being followed. He made the remark at the White House during an annual Easter celebration. Mueller’s report said that the 22-month investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russians during the 2016 election campaign, but Mueller did find “multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.”  According to the report, White House Counsel Don McGahn had been on the brink of resigning when Trump told him to ask Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller. Trump then denied using the word “fire,” according to McGahn’s retelling to Mueller. Trump lashed out at the report on Twitter later on Monday. “Isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller,” Trump wrote. Mueller’s report drew upon interviews, notes and communications with Trump advisers. Trump’s personal lawyer during the campaign, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes as did campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller’s report drew upon dozens of interviews, notes and communications with White House advisers. Asked on Monday whether he was concerned about the threat of impeachment on allegations of obstruction of justice as some Democrats have called for, Trump said, “Not even a little bit.” U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Friday said Congress should begin the process of removing Trump from office. Other Democratic leaders have played down talk of impeachment, just 18 months before the 2020 election. Republicans have stood by Trump and while an impeachment effort might succeed in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, it was unlikely to do so in the Republican-led Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday House Democrats’ views vary on how to proceed. Trump, speaking from the White House balcony on Monday, returned to favorite topics of his by touting the strong United States economy and saying his administration was rebuilding the military “to a level never seen before.”  “Our country is doing fantastically well, probably the best it has ever done economically,” he said.

234,US STOCKS-Futures sink after Trump escalates China tariff threat - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  10:36 AM / in a day","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Futures fall: Dow 1.92%, S&P 1.81%, Nasdaq 2.29% By Amy Caren Daniel May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures plunged on Monday after President Donald Trump shocked investors by threatening to hike tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, raising fears of a global slowdown and halting a relative period of calm in the markets. S&P futures lost more than 2% overnight after the Wall Street Journal reported China was considering canceling a round of U.S. talks set for this week in the wake of Trump’s comments. However, China said on Monday a delegation is still preparing to go to the United States for trade talks. Trump said tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate thanks to progress between the two sides. Investors pulled back from riskier bets on fears the trade war between the world’s biggest economies was escalating, especially as hopes of a deal have helped stocks surge this year, with the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq indexes hitting record highs last week. All the 28 Dow components that were trading premarket were in the red. Boeing Co, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 3.3%, while Caterpillar Inc also declined 3.3%. “The risk-off sentiment has been the response to this swerve from Trump,” said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. “While it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will press ahead with the added tariffs, it’s already evident that markets are taking some risk off the table, undermining the base case that investors had been pricing in: a formalized US-China trade deal in the near future.” Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked to its highest level since Jan. 30. Chipmakers, which get a good portion of their revenue from China, tumbled. Shares of Nvidia Corp, Micron Technology Inc and Intel Corp fell between 2.4% and 5.3%. At 6:09 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 508 points, or 1.92%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 53.25 points, or 1.81% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 179.75 points, or 2.29%. Marquee names such as Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Netflix Inc fell between 1.9% and 3.4%. Tesla Inc fell 2.3% after U.S. trade officials rejected the company’s bid for relief from Trump’s tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot “brain” of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles.

No one was hurt and the plane did not sustain any damage, the carrier said in a statement, adding that passengers were able to disembark from the plane themselves. NordStar blamed the incident on the poor weather conditions. It is the second such incident involving a Boeing 737-800 in a matter of days. On Friday night, a jetliner chartered by the U.S. military carrying 143 people slid into a shallow river while landing in Florida during a thunderstorm, injuring 22 people. U.S. federal investigators on Saturday began investigating the reason for the incident.

237,"Stronger shekel a challenge for Israeli inflation, rate hikes - MPC member - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  9:14 AM / in a day","2 Min ReadJERUSALEM, May 6 (Reuters) - A strengthening shekel has become a concern for the Bank of Israel and could help to delay further interest rate increases, a voting member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee said on Monday. Andrew Abir, head of market operations at the Bank of Israel, said the exchange rate was another challenge that would affect future monetary policy in addition to weakening global growth and trade that have helped to lower expectations for tightening in the United States and Europe. “The depreciation of the shekel in 2018 has been partly reversed, and if the appreciation continues, as the monetary committee has emphasised, it may delay the increase of inflation toward the midpoint of the target range,” he told a conference. The shekel has appreciated some 4 percent so far this year versus the dollar after an 8 percent depreciation in 2018. Against a basket of currencies of Israel’s main trading partners, the shekel stands near a six-month high. After a surprise rate increase in November, policymakers have held the benchmark lending rate at 0.25 percent at the subsequent three meetings. The central bank has said future hikes would be gradual and cautious and depended on inflation moving near the midpoint of the target - or around 2 percent. The rate stood at 1.4 percent in March. The next decision is May 20 but an increase is not widely expected until later in 2019. The bank’s own economists project a quarter-point increase towards the end of the third quarter.

238,EXPLAINER-Counting the cost of the U.S.-China trade war so far - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  9:06 AM / a day ago","6 Min ReadHONG KONG, May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s fresh threats of tariff hikes on Chinese imports this week marked a new escalation in the trade dispute between the world’s top two economies and a reversal of months of apparent progress in negotiations. The trade war formally kicked off in July last year with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports, which were followed by tariffs on an extra $16 billion in August and another $200 billion in September. China has retaliated on each of these measures with its own set of tariffs. A subsequent threat to raise tariffs on the September list of products to 25 percent from 10 percent in March was suspended, pending trade talks. In the latest development, Trump on Sunday said those increases could now take effect on Friday and that he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods “shortly”. All up, the tariffs would effectively cover all imports of Chinese goods into the United States. Here is a look at the impact the U.S.-China trade war has had so far on the two economies and the rest of the world. China’s customs data shows exports to the United States in March fell 47 percent from June 2018, which was the last month before the first round of tariffs kicked in. Imports from the United States in March were 17 percent lower. Cumulatively, in the first quarter of 2019, Chinese imports fell almost a third year-on-year, while exports fell almost a tenth. In dollar terms, a decline in two-way trade of $25 billion accounts for around 0.5 percent of global trade. Compounding the decline in imports into China was a broader weakening in domestic demand following Beijing’s campaign against financial risk taking. The bulk of the decline in U.S. exports to China is in raw materials and food. They represent about a third of the total and have more than halved, according to Oxford Economics. But U.S. firms in other sectors, including Caterpillar and Apple, have also issued China sales warnings. Of all Chinese exports to the United States, machinery and electrical equipment have taken the biggest hit. Most analysts estimate direct U.S. losses so far of 0.1-0.2 percent of gross domestic product, while for China the damage could be 0.3-0.6 percent of GDP. These could grow with more, and higher tariffs. Theses estimates, however, do not take into account how the trade war impacts investment and spending decisions by firms and consumers while domestic policy measures also muddy the waters considerably. Partly reacting to external headwinds, the U.S. Federal Reserve has put monetary policy tightening on hold with markets now actually forecasting a rate cut this year. China has also responded with cuts in bank reserve requirement ratios, which have boosted domestic lending to a record 5.81 trillion yuan ($862.8 billion) in the first quarter. Tax cuts are estimated to unleash an extra 2 trillion yuan, while local governments are also allowed to issue 2.15 trillion yuan of special bonds to fund infrastructure projects. China’s economy grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter. In the last pre-tariff quarter, April-June 2018, the economy grew 6.7 percent, but the difference accounts for some domestically-inflicted slowdown, U.S. import frontloading, domestic policy moves, and other seasonal factors. The U.S. economy grew 3.2 percent in the first quarter, faster than the 2.9 percent in the last pre-tariff quarter. CROSS-BORDER TRADE IMPACT S&P Global Market Intelligence’s trade data firm Panjiva says U.S. import flows are being re-routed. U.S. imports of furniture from China fell 13.5 percent in the first quarter, which compares with a 37.2 percent increase in imports from Vietnam and a 19.3 percent rise from Taiwan. For refrigerators, imports from China fell 24.1 percent, but South Korea and Mexico each saw 32 percent jumps. Tire imports from China fell 28.6 percent, while those from Vietnam surged 141.7 percent. A DBS analysis of Asian supply chains for U.S.-bound products shows the biggest risks in machinery and electrical equipment in South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan. South Korea’s minerals and petrochemicals exports were also exposed, as well as Indonesia’s transportation industry, according to the DBS report. A study by think-tank Centre for Economic Policy Research showed about $165 billion in trade has been lost or redirected in order to avoid tariffs. Since last July, the S&P 500 index has risen 8 percent while Shanghai stocks are up 5 percent, though this is a reflection of looser-than-expected monetary policy globally and in China, as well as hopes for a trade deal this year. The yuan took a hit last year, falling 5.3 percent against the U.S. dollar, before stabilising in 2019. UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele estimates more tit-for-tat tariffs could shrink U.S. earnings by 5 percent, which, coupled with falling valuations could result in a 10-15 percent decline in U.S. equities. Chinese equities could also fall 15-20 percent, while the yuan might breach 7.0 per dollar. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore;

239,Altice Europe to save 110 million euros annually via debt deal - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  6:16 AM / a day ago","2 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - Telecoms and cable company Altice Europe will save more than 110 million euros ($123 million) annually after refinancing debt in a deal that it said would strengthen its financial position. The company, whose brands include SFR in France, said it had successfully priced and allocated 2.8 billion euros ($3.1 billion) worth of new 8-year senior bond notes at its Altice Luxembourg SA unit following an offering that was oversubscribed. Altice Europe, founded by billionaire Patrick Drahi, has been selling assets and restructuring to reduce its debt burden. It announced last month that profits at its main French business had improved in the first quarter. In the past year, Amsterdam-listed Altice Europe has shifted its focus from cost-cutting towards gaining clients while selling infrastructure assets to reassure investors, after making heavy investments in broadcasting rights. [nL8N1XW5OZ] Altice Europe had net debts of around 29 billion euros at the end of 2018. The company has a current stock market capitalization of around 5.2 billion euros. “This refinancing transaction demonstrates Altice Europe’s commitment to proactively managing its liabilities across its capital structure, significantly improving its maturity schedule, reducing its gross leverage and moving closer to its leverage target while reducing its annual cash cost,” said Altice Europe chief financial officer Malo Corbin. “We continue to receive strong support from the debt capital markets to execute on our strategy and achieve our revenue and cash flow growth targets for 2019,” added Corbin. Shares in Altice Europe dipped 1.1 percent, tracking a broader decline on global markets after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations.

240,"WRAPUP 4-China stocks fall most in over 3 years on tariff threats, yuan tumbles - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  8:59 AM / a day ago","6 Min Read(Updates with Hong Kong stocks, yuan domestic close) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes fell the most in more than three years. The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both tumbled more than 5 percent, posting their steepest single-day drop since February 2016. Around 1,000 mainland firms plummet the maximum allowed 10 percent daily limit. Market sentiment was lifted somewhat after China said its trade delegation is preparing to go to the United States. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index ended down 2.9 percent, recouping some lost ground in the late afternoon session. “Afternoon trading was quieter. MOFCOM’s announcement helped, at least people know that the negotiations will carry on,” said Steven Leung, sales director at broker UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. The yuan’s losses also narrowed after the news, closing at 6.7666 per dollar in onshore trade. In earlier trade, the yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it would cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily but is not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilise the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares have surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it would cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung. $1 = 6.7886 Chinese yuan

MSCI’s index for emerging-market stocks fell 1.5 percent as investors ran to safety of bonds, gold and other less-risky assets. The Chinese yuan led declines by emerging-market currencies, heading for its biggest drop in 10 months. Trump ramped up pressure on China on Sunday to reach a trade deal, saying he would raise U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. China’s foreign ministry said it still hoped the United States would meet China halfway and said a Chinese delegation was preparing to go to the U.S. The Wall Street Journal had reported that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. Equities fell across the developing world, particularly in Asia, as negotiations to end a trade war between the world’s largest economies were thrown into doubt. Mainland China shares plunged almost 6 percent, their worst one-day fall since February 2016. The yuan was set for its biggest drop in 10 months. Oil prices slumped taking a toll on currencies of net exporters like Russia’s rouble. Turkey’s lira weakened against the dollar but was off a low of 6.02, which it reached amid concern over legal challenges to local election results in Istanbul. The lira has slumped 11 percent so far this year. South Africa’s rand fell as worries grew over elections on Wednesday.

242,Vulnerable House Democrats tread carefully in wake of Mueller report - Reuters,"April 20, 2019 /  11:04 AM / 16 days ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Vulnerable House Democrats, mindful of President Donald Trump’s continued strength among Republican voters, are using caution in how they respond to the special counsel’s report, which detailed Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation into Russian efforts to help him win the White House. More than 30 Democratic representatives, many of whom are in their first term, represent districts that supported Trump in 2016. The party’s chances of keeping control of the U.S. House of Representatives likely hinge its ability to defend those seats. In the report released on Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Trump may have obstructed justice and portrayed a president bent on stopping the probe into Russian meddling. But Mueller stopped short of concluding that a crime was committed, leaving it to Congress to make its own determination. That is putting pressure on congressional Democrats to decide whether to pursue impeachment charges against Trump, whose continued popularity with his Republican base could weigh heavily on Democratic lawmakers in swing districts. Those incumbent Democrats may have to strike a delicate balance on the campaign trail next year. Too much bashing of the president could turn off voters more interested in kitchen-table issues and motivate Trump sympathizers to rally around him. Hours after Mueller’s findings were released, Abby Spanberger, a Democratic congresswoman from Virginia, held a town hall that saw virtually no discussion of the report. She knocked off a Republican incumbent last year in a district that favored Trump by more than 6 percentage points in 2016. The 39-year-old representative told reporters before the event that she was more interested in preventing Russia from attacking the electoral process than in “re-litigating” the 2016 presidential contest. “Regardless of what actions the president did or didn’t take ... understanding in far greater detail the aggression of a foreign adversary nation against our election’s infrastructure should ideally help us avoid such circumstances in the future,” she said. Other Democrats facing reelection in swing districts also reacted cautiously, saying they would reserve judgment until after reading the voluminous report, or emphasizing the threat of Russian interference rather than Trump’s behavior. “If the conclusion remains that there is no further criminal wrongdoing, I think we should, as a country, move on and ensure that Russia cannot interfere again,” said Ben McAdams, a freshman Utah Democrat in a Republican-leaning district.  The 448-page report’s release has sparked an internal debate within the Democratic Party on how to move forward. Party leaders played down talk of impeachment, even as they said they would pursue a full, unredacted copy of the report and bring Mueller himself to Capitol Hill to testify under oath. At the same time, some liberal members of the caucus, including Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York, expressed support for starting an impeachment inquiry.  U.S. Representative Cheri Bustos, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the party’s House campaign arm, set the tone for her most endangered colleagues on Thursday. In a statement, she said she would read the report carefully, then pivoted to other issues.  “As we review this report, I also remain committed to continuing my efforts to bring down the cost of health care, invest in our infrastructure and clean up the mess in Washington,” Bustos said. Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat who won her first term last fall in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, told Reuters many Democrats were elected because “voters want checks and balances and a return to good government and government we can trust.” Still, speaking after a town hall on Thursday evening, the 35-year-old emphasized that most voters going into 2020 are more concerned about issues such as health care, education and infrastructure. One of her constituents, Joy Marie Zug, said she voted for Trump in 2016 after having supported Democratic President Barack Obama. Zug says she has since soured on Trump due to his “lies.” The 46-year-old adult education administrator said Democrats should consider impeachment, based on the mountain of evidence in the Mueller report. But in a reflection of the difficulty of the strategic choice facing Democrats, she also said they should avoid making it a top campaign issue. “I don’t think this is something they need to run on,” she said. “I just wish this wasn’t the end.” Democrats looking to 2020 must also weigh whether voters’ views on the Russia probe are even susceptible to persuasion, given the country’s deep partisan divides. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Thursday and Friday after the report came out found 50 percent of Americans agreed that Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia during the campaign, and 58 percent of respondents said they believed Trump tried to stop investigations into the campaign’s conduct. Those figures, which split heavily along party lines, were fairly similar to previous polls. One senior Democratic strategist involved in shaping the campaign message for 2020 House candidates, who asked for anonymity when discussing the party’s internal thinking, said the party’s own research showed the Russia probe was not particularly resonant for voters. Still, he said Mueller’s findings would create the background “mood music” when Democrats talk in broad terms about corruption and government accountability.

243,Republican Romney says he is 'sickened' by Trump's behavior during Russia probe - Reuters,"April 19, 2019 /  10:28 PM / 18 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday he was “sickened” by the dishonesty of U.S. President Donald Trump and people around him as portrayed in a report on Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election. Romney, now a U.S. senator from Utah and an off-and-on Trump critic, was responding to the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who described how Trump sought to disrupt the probe into ties between his presidential campaign and Russia.  Mueller did not establish that Trump’s campaign team colluded with Moscow and he did not charge the president with obstructing justice, but the report provided extensive details of Trump’s efforts to thwart the probe. Romney said it was “good news” that there had been insufficient evidence to charge Trump with conspiring with a foreign adversary or obstructing justice, which he said could have triggered a constitutional crisis. “Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President,” Romney said in a statement posted on Twitter.  “I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia - including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine,” he added. Romney was sharply critical of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign before being considered briefly as a candidate for secretary of state in Trump’s administration. His sharp statement on Friday breaks with the position of other Republicans and the White House, which has declared the report a victory for the president. Trump has repeatedly dubbed the investigation a “witch hunt” and insisted he did not engage in collusion or obstruction. Trump remains popular with most Republicans but a potential challenge from someone such as Romney in the Republican primary process next year could complicate Trump’s bid to win a second term in 2020. Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to Democratic candidate Barack Obama.  Congressional Democrats on Friday took legal action to get hold of all of Mueller’s evidence from his inquiry.

244,Trump approval drops 3 points to 2019 low after release of Mueller report: Reuters/Ipsos poll - Reuters,"April 19, 2019 /  6:57 PM / 18 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of Americans who approve of President Donald Trump dropped by 3 percentage points to the lowest level of the year following the release of a special counsel report detailing Russian interference in the last U.S. presidential election, according to an exclusive Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll. The poll, conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning, is the first national survey to measure the response from the American public after the U.S. Justice Department released Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report that recounted numerous occasions in which Trump may have interfered with the investigation.  According to the poll, 37 percent of adults in the United States approved of Trump’s performance in office, down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matching the lowest level of the year. That is also down from 43 percent in a poll conducted shortly after U.S. Attorney General William Barr circulated a summary of the report in March. In his report, Mueller said his investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russians. However, investigators did find “multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.”  While Mueller ultimately decided not to charge Trump with a crime, he also said that the investigation did not exonerate the president, either.     The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,005 adults, including 924 who were familiar with the Mueller report. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.  To see the entire Reuters/Ipsos poll, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2DjEq3R The poll found that 50 percent of Americans agreed that “Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election,” and 58 percent agreed that the president “tried to stop investigations into Russian influence on his administration.” Forty percent said they thought Trump should be impeached, while 42 percent said he should not. The poll responses were sharply split along party lines, with Democrats much more critical of Trump than his fellow Republicans.  The Mueller investigation had previously charged 34 other people and three Russian entities, netting convictions or guilty pleas from several Trump associates including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen. So far, the report does not appear to have convinced many to change their opinions about the president’s conduct during a bitter presidential campaign, whether his inner circle improperly engaged with Russian agents, or if he tried to interfere with federal investigators afterward.  Among those respondents who said they were familiar with the Mueller report, 70 percent said the report had not changed their view of Trump or Russia’s involvement in the U.S. presidential race. Only 15 percent said they had learned something that changed their view of Trump or the Russia investigation, and a majority of those respondents said they were now more likely to believe that “Trump or someone close to him broke the law.” (For a 'Link to Mueller report' click here)     (For a graphic on 'A closer look at Mueller report redactions' click tmsnrt.rs/2VSx7HZ) Reporting by Chris Kahn; Editing by Andrea RicciAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

246,"Trump ratchets up pressure on China, threatens tariff hikes - Reuters","May 5, 2019 /  4:57 PM / a day ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on China on Sunday to reach a trade deal, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon.  The move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world’s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled as negotiations were thrown into doubt. The Wall Street Journal reported that China was considering cancelling this week’s trade talks in Washington in light of Trump’s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise. A less than rosy update from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some previous commitments, prompted Trump’s decision. “The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!” Trump said in a tweet. U.S. officials did not weigh in on whether China would attend this week’s talks. The White House and the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office declined to comment. China’s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The atmosphere of the negotiations has changed,” said a Chinese official with knowledge of the situation.  Whether the talks would proceed and how they would proceed are issues that are now being re-evaluated, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  “All that depends on the attitude of the United States,” the official said.  The editor of an influential, Chinese state-run newspaper said Vice Premier Liu He was unlikely to go. “Let Trump raise tariffs. Let’s see when trade talks can resume,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the tabloid the Global Times, tweeted.  The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, but it is not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese media outlets have been told not to independently report on Trump’s overnight tweets or tweet about them, and instead adhere to any report from the official Xinhua news agency, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter.  Global financial markets, which had been expecting news of a trade deal soon, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled, with China’s main indexes plunging 5 percent. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets.” Trump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate thanks to progress between the two sides. The president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly,” essentially covering all products imported to the United States from China. Mindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump suggested the measures were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. “The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,” he tweeted. Tariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by the companies importing the goods, and most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while supportive of Trump’s crackdown on China’s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded. “Raising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,” said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Nevertheless, the president’s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to “hang tough” in a tweet: “Don’t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.” One Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence.  “The urgency is gone. So, it’s likely to see a longer trade war,” the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the topic. The trade war resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018, hitting industries including autos, technology - and above all, agriculture, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Trump’s move could backfire, said Tai Hui, Asia-Pacific chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.  “As we learnt a year ago, Beijing could be willing to walk away if the U.S. applies negotiation tactics that they don’t agree with. That said, both sides have invested significant time and resources to come this far...” On Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the round in Beijing “productive,” and one White House official told Reuters that dates were being looked at for a potential meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping in June. Last week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, but a Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained. The increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday would be the first since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year.  Negotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be lifted, while Trump wants to keep some, if not all, of them as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.

Mueller’s report, released on Thursday, details extensive contacts between Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russian operatives who, it said, sought to tilt the election in Trump’s favor. However, the report did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s election campaign and Russia. Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow regretted the Mueller report was having an impact on its relations with Washington. “In general, the report still does not include any reasonable evidence at all that Russia allegedly interfered in the U.S. election.  “We, as before, do not accept such allegations,” Peskov said.  “We regret that a document of this quality is having a direct impact on the development of bilateral Russian-U.S. relations that are already not in the best condition,” he added.

250,"WRAPUP 2-China stocks, yuan tumble on Trump's fresh tariff threats - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  3:45 AM / in a day","5 Min Read(Updates prices, add background) By Luoyan Liu and Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Chinese investors, caught off guard by U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, dumped stocks and sold the yuan currency on Monday as a fresh deterioration in Sino-U.S. trade tensions roiled Asian financial markets. The country’s major stock indexes were heading for their worst daily loss in three years, with the blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index tumbling more than 5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slumped more than 3 percent. Trump stunned global markets with a tweet late on Sunday announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon, saying trade talks with China were going too slowly. Markets had largely priced in expectations that a trade deal would be reached soon, further reducing pressure on China’s economy, which has recently shown tentative signs of steadying. Fanning expectations that fresh trade uncertainty could lead to additional monetary easing, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) for small and medium-sized banks. The yuan dropped to as low as 6.7994 per dollar in early onshore trade, its weakest level in 3-1/2 months, while the offshore yuan fell as much as 1.3 percent. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds slipped to 3.387 percent, a two-week low. Trump’s move marked a major escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies and raises the prospect of a collapse in the trade talks which would further pressure the global economy. “The market is re-pricing the situation, as investors had thought trade negotiations were coming to an end,” said Ken Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. “If the trade war reignites, some market participants may speculate about renewed yuan depreciation to counteract the negative impact from rising tariffs,” he said. But China’s bond market would benefit from “diversion from equities, and renewed expectation for easing,” said Frances Cheung, head of Asia macro strategy at Westpac in Singapore. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is “very unlikely” to go to the United States this week following Trump’s “threat” to hike tariffs, the editor-in-chief of China’s influential Global Times said on Monday. The newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily, but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” “Optimism toward the trade talks turned into pessimism overnight,” said Stephen Huang, chief risk officer at Shanghai See Truth Investment Management. “The government needs to roll out more stimulus to stabilize the market,” he said, expecting broader reductions in reserve ratios, and even a possible cut in interest rates. Stocks fell across the board on Monday, with technology shares among the worst casualties. The agriculture sector was the only bright spot, with shares including Hefei Fengle Seed Co Ltd and Great-Sun Foods Co Ltd surging 10 percent on expectations they could benefit if Beijing retaliates against U.S. imports if Washington hikes tariffs. Chinese shares had surged some 30 percent so far this year, partly due to optimism that a trade deal would be reached, but they have pulled back in recent weeks as investors scaled down expectations for further stimulus in light of better March economic data. “In the near term, investors are rightfully worried since the lingering threat of a trade war weighed on risk assets in 2018, especially in Asia,” Tai Hui, Chief Market Strategist, Asia Pacific, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a note. But Huang at Shanghai See Truth Investment said that unlike in 2018, when Chinese stocks suffered from a double-whammy of the trade war and Beijing’s clampdown on debt, “liquidity conditions are much better this year.” In a move to bolster domestic growth, China’s central bank said on Monday it will cut reserve requirements for small and medium-sized banks. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement that the reduction will release about 280 billion yuan ($41.25 billion) in long-term funding, which will be used for loans to small and private companies. Such a move had been expected this year, but it was announced right before China’s stock market opened, and just hours after Trump’s tweets. While the move failed to provide any immediate support to market sentiment, it was expected to give some help to parts of the economy affected by the trade war and a wider slowdown. “It is in line with the domestic need, which is targeted, while the timing is convenient in view of the heightened external risk,” said Westpac’s Cheung.

251,"FOREX-Yen gains, yuan skids as Trump springs China trade shock - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  5:30 AM / a day ago","4 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading, yuan slips * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * SCMP reports China’s He will go to Washington on Thursday * U.S. and Nikkei stock futures skid, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen climbed and the yuan slid on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China, sending stocks and commodities into a tailspin. Some losses were recouped when the South China Morning Post reported China Vice-Premier Liu He would travel to Washington on Thursday after a delay, rather than cancelling planned talks altogether. However, the SCMP later said no decision had been made on the trip and it might indeed be cancelled, leaving the market guessing. In a surprise twist on Sunday, Trump announced he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The Twitter message marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to the Middle East to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.81 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China was back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen before steadying to 123.96. The single currency was calm against the dollar at $1.1191, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.549. The dollar climbed 0.9 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.7921 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 5.7 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960 before steadying to $0.6986. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets,” he added. As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.1 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Simon Cameron-Moore)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

252,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares, oil plunge after Trump vows China tariff hike - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  5:00 AM / in a day","6 Min Read* MSCI Asia ex-Japan sinks 2 pct * Trump tweets tariff hike on Chinese goods due Friday * China blue-chips drop more than 6 pct despite targeted RRR cut * Safe-haven yen jumps, China’s yuan plummets * Markets see higher chance of further easing * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, May 6 (Reuters) - Global financial markets reeled on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on China to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. Equity markets, which have been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade agreement soon, fell sharply as further talks to end their bruising trade war were thrown into doubt. The trade war has resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides, while inflicting collateral damage on export-reliant economies and companies from Japan to Germany. Chinese shares plunged more than 5 percent, while U.S. stock market futures fell 2 percent. Oil prices sank and the Chinese yuan weakened sharply. Trump sharply escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that trade talks with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of improving economic growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. “I think this has got the potential to be a real game-changer,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “There is still a question of whether this is one of the famous Trump negotiation tactics, or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs. If it’s the latter, we’ll see massive downside pressure across all markets,” he said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 2 percent as markets across the region fell deep into the red. Chinese blue-chips lost more than 6 percent at one point in the morning session, having closed higher before a three-day national holiday amid expectations that pressures on China’s economy were easing. They later clawed back some losses, and finished the morning session down 5.5 percent. The drop in Chinese shares came despite a move on Monday by China’s central bank to cut reserve requirements for small banks to help boost lending to small and private firms. Australian shares were off 0.9 percent. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures were down 2.3 percent at 21,965. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.9 percent, erasing memories of gains on Friday after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street and signalling a rough open for U.S. stocks on Monday. “The risk for (Trump) is that the Chinese don’t play ball and don’t go ahead with the negotiation,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney. “It’s not in his interest for shares to go down as it would hit U.S. business confidence and investment, and that would shoot up unemployment. And that would be a risk for his re-election, too,” he said. But economists at Citi painted a brighter picture of the outlook for Chinese markets following the recent stabilisation of the Chinese economy. “Should trade tensions resume, we expect a speedy reaction by China’s policy-makers, with policy implementation made more effective. Given the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus is large in the near term, we believe the negative impact from additional tariffs will likely be managed better this time,” they said in a note. The flight from riskier assets boosted interest in safe havens, pushing U.S. Treasury futures up 22 ticks. Data from CME Group showed the market now sees a nearly 59 percent chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut by the end of the year. Chinese 10-year treasury futures also jumped, with the most-traded contract, for June delivery rising as much as  0.5 percent. They were last up 0.26 percent at 96.850. “The intensified trade and geopolitical risks are likely to prompt the regional central banks for more stimulatory policies,” analysts at ING said in a note. “We expect the majority of Asian central banks meeting this week to cut their policy rates.” As investors flocked to the safe-haven yen, the dollar dropped 0.4 percent against the Japanese currency to 110.61 . But China’s yuan plunged, with the offshore unit weakening to 6.8215 per dollar, its weakest level since January 10, before paring some losses. The onshore yuan weakened nearly 1 percent to 6.7980 per dollar before bouncing back to 6.7832. In contrast to the sharp moves in Asian currencies, the euro was down less than 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1193, and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was flat at 97.519. In commodity markets, Trump’s tweets sparked a plunge in oil prices. U.S. crude at one point dropped as much as 3.1 percent to a more-than-five-week low, before bouncing to $60.44 per barrel - still off 2.4 percent on the day. Brent crude was 2.2 percent lower at $69.26 per barrel The tweets have compounded pressure on prices amid signs of a rise in U.S. output, which has surged by more than 2 million barrels per day since early 2018.

253,"Funds dig deeper into bearish CBOT bets as heavy stocks, trade war weigh: Braun - Reuters","May 6, 2019 /  4:32 AM / a day ago","6 Min ReadFORT COLLINS, Colo. (Reuters) - Heavy world stocks, trade conflicts, and demand disruptions have led speculators to end April on a record bearish note across Chicago-traded grains and oilseeds, and a sharp reversal in investor attitude anytime soon seems unlikely.  When combining money managers' net positions in CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, along with Kansas City and Minneapolis wheat, the overall net short reached 683,501 futures and options contracts as of April 30, up from 656,078 a week prior, which was the previous record. (tmsnrt.rs/2LqH2DO)  The agriculture market has been grappling with record U.S. soybean stocks and rising corn stocks, an excellent U.S. wheat crop, and strong export competition among major world suppliers for all three products. Feed demand in China, which imports massive quantities of soybeans for its hog herd, has recently been disappointing as the country is battling an outbreak of deadly African swine fever.  Market participants have been hopeful that a potential trade resolution between the United States and China might be able to cure tumbling CBOT futures, but those hopes were blasted on Sunday as U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tensions by saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods this week. This comes after many months of headlines saying the trade talks were going well and that a resolution could be reached soon. Beijing was unimpressed with Trump’s ideas and as of late Sunday night, China’s Vice Premier Liu He was considering cancelling his planned trip to the United States this week to continue trade talks.  Markets reacted harshly to this news. Early in overnight trade from Sunday to Monday, July corn futures were down as much as 15 cents per bushel and July soybeans dropped up to 20 cents.  Drier forecasts for the U.S. Corn Belt heading into mid-month also weighed on futures overnight. Heavy, persistent rains have halted a large portion of U.S. fieldwork, causing concerns that the corn crop may not get planted to full intentions.  In the week ended April 30, hedge funds and other money managers cut their net short position in CBOT corn futures and options to 306,699 contracts from a record 322,215 in the prior week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPjxhe)  On the other end of the spectrum, producers cut their net long in corn to 12,527 futures and options contracts from a record 47,097 a week earlier. This is only the fourth week ever, and fourth in a row, that producers held a bullish stance in the yellow grain, and this continues to cap rally potential should funds decide to cover their short positions.  Wet weather across the U.S. Corn Belt has delayed the planting of the crop in many key states such as Illinois. This led to a modest rise in CBOT corn futures from Wednesday through Friday, and commodity funds were presumed to be straight buyers of the grain during that time.  Meanwhile, funds were likely straight sellers of CBOT soybean futures over the last three sessions. Significant planting delays for U.S. corn can often lead to a rise in soybean plantings, which along with the U.S.-China trade war and record stockpiles did not create positive sentiments among investors. Through April 30, money managers' net short in soybeans hit a new record of 148,526 futures and options contracts. That compares with 129,566 contracts in the previous week, and that was a record at the time. (tmsnrt.rs/2DQMhq2) Similar to corn, producers are loaded up on soybeans, which would not be supportive of a drastic futures rally should fundamentals unexpectedly turn positive. Producers’ net long in soybean futures and options rose to 69,145 contracts from 63,510 a week earlier. The new position is about 10,000 contracts below producers’ record net long.  Funds also hit new record bearish bets in Kansas City wheat futures and options through April 30. The net short of 58,494 contracts is up from 53,673 in the previous week and tops the old record of 54,295 contracts set two weeks earlier. (tmsnrt.rs/2DPk2I8)  K.C. July wheat futures rose nearly 2 percent over the last three sessions after Tuesday’s contract lows, but they had fallen back down near those lows early in Sunday night’s trading.  Money managers extended their net short in CBOT wheat futures and options to 83,502 contracts through April 30, their most bearish wheat view in 15 months. They also added 43 futures and options contracts to their net short in Minneapolis wheat, which hit 12,609 contracts. That is funds’ most bearish spring wheat stance since July.  Speculators’ moves in the soy complex through April 30 were not very dramatic. Money managers extended their net short in soybean oil to 58,072 futures and options contracts from 50,637 in the previous week, and they cut their net short in soybean meal to 15,599 contracts from 19,429 a week earlier. Trade sources predict that commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT wheat, net sellers of soybean meal, and straight sellers of soybean oil between Wednesday and Friday.

254,Occidental tweaks $38 billion Anadarko bid to remove shareholder vote - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  6:59 PM / in a day","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Sunday, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. The move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid, including T Rowe Price, will not get an opportunity to vote it down. It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko, but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Anadarko confirmed that it received the revised bid from Occidental and said its board will review the proposal. The merger agreement with Chevron remains in effect, Anadarko said and reaffirmed its existing recommendation of the deal with Chevron at this time. Earlier on Sunday, France’s Total SA said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion, should the two U.S. oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine. This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non-core to the deal. On Tuesday, Occidental also secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko. The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors.  Occidental submitted a new $76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, as opposed to an even cash/stock split in its $76 per share offer previously.  This brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders. Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal. The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques. “The financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms. However, a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko’s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted, Occidental added. Should Occidental’s bid be declared superior by Anadarko, Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental’s offer, according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko. Should Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee. The proposed sale of Anadarko’s African assets to Total includes a 26.5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which is moving closer to a final investment decision, and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana. Occidental said this does not impact the planned $2 billion of annual cost savings and $1.5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko. Total’s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal, the French company said in a separate statement. Chevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its $65-a-share bid. Separately, Occidental said its first-quarter adjusted profit fell 10.9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue. Adjusted profit fell to $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $708 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Production rose 18 percent to 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, Occidental said. Its Permian Resources unit saw output rising 47 percent year-over-year to 261,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Beijing might cancel talks with their U.S. counterparts in Washington planned for Wednesday. CNBC followed with a report that China would “likely” cancel the trip. Nor was sentiment helped by news the United States was deploying a carrier strike group to deter any attack from Iran amid heightened tensions over sanctions. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.53 yen, having earlier touched a five-week trough at 110.335 on Reuters dealing. It had ended Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China is back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.33 yen and was last at 123.56. The single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.1191, while the dollar index was barely changed at 97.519. The dollar climbed 1 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.8007 , while Shanghai blue chips lost 4 percent. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last down at $0.6982. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.9 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 20 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2.2 percent, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy. The futures market on Monday moved to price in an even greater chance of a rate cut this year as Trump’s tariff warnings were seen as a risk to the global economy and business sentiment. Futures imply a funds rate around 2.220 percent by December compared with the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. “Investors will be hoping that this step by the president is more of a negotiating tactic than a statement of intent,” said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at broker Rakuten. “Any signs that a deal will be pushed further down the track or not progress at all could send markets into a tailspin.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill & Sam Holmes)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

259,Fed faces tough sell on inflation framework - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  9:02 PM / in 2 days","6 Min ReadPALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers fear they are ill-equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation-targeting approach, and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs. But for the U.S. central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in Palo Alto Friday to discuss available options, the challenge was clear: not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits, figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge. Indeed, just to explain their ideas to each other, Fed policymakers and academics at the Hoover Institution’s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations, lengthy bullet points, and nearly indecipherable charts. And while most of the PhD economists in the audience presumably understood the theories, “I think where people disagree is, do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life?” Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. In other words, what will really work? When central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they thought they were facing once-in-a-lifetime conditions.  But a decade on from the end of the Great Recession, it’s clear the Fed is dealing with a new economic norm. Neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with U.S. unemployment at a near 50-year low.  That leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had.  So this year, with the U.S. economy on an even keel, interest rate policy on pause, and an expansion set to reach record length this summer, Fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along.  Among the ideas: commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above-target inflation; target economic output, rather than inflation directly; and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns.  All would, their advocates say, act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions.  Each would differ, to greater or lesser degrees, from the Fed’s current approach, by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment. And all would depend critically on households, businesses and financial markets understanding the framework, and reacting accordingly. Average inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far. The idea, New York Fed President John Williams explained, is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period - say, a year and a half.  When inflation falls during periods of economic stress, the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time.  If households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future, they will borrow and spend more during recessions, which would theoretically speed the economy’s return to health. But for the plan to work, spenders will have to believe the Fed really will drive inflation higher in the future. By contrast, negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy; if they just keep their money at the bank, they’ll end up paying for the privilege. For such a regime to be accepted, however, ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn’t be punished as well.  Fed policymakers have largely rejected negative rates, but some central banks have tried it and academics like Harvard University professor Kenneth Rogoff, who presented his work at the Hoover conference, maintain it is a viable option. Not everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework, not even the Fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas.   “The bar for change is high,” San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly said. “It can be costly to make mistakes in this space.” St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard has long advocated a framework known as nominal GDP targeting where the Fed would target a specific level of economic output rather than prices directly.  But even as he gave a new pitch for the idea, he expressed trepidation with such a radical change: experimenting with the way the world’s biggest central bank does business, he said, could “unleash chaos” in global financial markets.   One of the challenges of selling a new framework is that for the past 10 years, central banks globally have failed to deliver on their current 2-percent inflation targets, the prevailing international standard.  To Cleveland Fed’s Mester, having a set of rules, whatever they may be, could make policy more effective by making it easier for people to understand the aims, and limits, of Fed actions. And Fed policymakers in Palo Alto seemed keen on exploring new ideas. The Fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year. Most in the audience gave the Fed credit for tackling the issue.

260,"Mueller finds no conspiracy, but extensive Trump-Russia contacts - Reuters","April 18, 2019 /  11:43 PM / 19 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller may not have found evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, but his report details extensive contacts between the campaign and Russian operatives who sought to influence the election.    Mueller said in his report released on Thursday that he found “numerous links” and that the Trump campaign “expected it would benefit” from Russia’s effort to tilt the ballot in Trump’s favor. Ultimately, Mueller determined the various contacts either didn’t amount to criminal behavior or would be difficult to prove in court, even if people in Trump’s orbit sometimes displayed a willingness to accept Russian help, the report showed.  Trump and his allies, who derided the Mueller probe as a political “witch hunt”, portrayed the report as vindication. “No collusion. No obstruction. For all the haters and the radical left Democrats, game over,” Trump tweeted on Thursday.  “The bottom line is the president is exonerated and the campaign is exonerated of collusion,” said Michael Caputo, a former adviser to Trump’s campaign. Some legal experts and political strategists were more circumspect, saying the report confirmed the Russian government was attempting to help Trump with the election.  “I think that’s a pretty extraordinary finding of historical significance, whether or not there’s a crime,” said Matthew Jacobs, a former federal prosecutor who is now a San Francisco-based lawyer. Many of the contacts in the report were already known. They included former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s  conversations in late 2016 with Sergei Kislyak, Russia ambassador at the time, and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a political consultant who the FBI has determined has ties to Russian intelligence. But the report contained fresh details on the range of official and unofficial dealings Trump campaign advisers and supporters had with Russians before and after the 2016 election.  For example, the report says that Manafort, shortly after he joined the campaign in the spring of 2016, directed his deputy to share internal polling data with Kilimnik with the understanding it would be passed on to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch known to have close ties to the Kremlin. Lawyers for Manafort did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kilimnik did not reply to an email seeking comment. A Washington-based attorney for Deripsaka said he could not comment. In a statement to Reuters in January, representatives for Deripaska said he has never had any communication with Kilimnik. The report also says that Manafort told Kilimnik in August 2017 about the campaign’s efforts to win the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Trump ended up winning three of those states in the November election. Mueller’s investigation did not find a connection between Manafort’s sharing of polling data and Russia’s meddling in the U.S. election or that he otherwise coordinated with Russia. Frank Montoya, a former senior FBI official, said he was nonetheless bothered by the interactions between Manafort and Kilimnik, especially their talking about battleground states.   “As a longtime counterintelligence investigator it makes the hair stand on the back of my neck,” Montoya said. The report detailed a meeting in December 2016 between Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Sergei Gorkov, the head of a Russian state-owned bank under U.S. sanctions. Gorkov gave Kushner a painting and a bag of soil from the town in Belarus where Kushner’s family is from, the report says. Mueller’s team said it could not resolve a conflict in the accounts of Kushner, who said the meeting was diplomatic in nature, and Gorkov, who said it was business related. Kushner has said neither sanctions nor his business activities were discussed at the meeting. Kushner’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment on Mueller’s report. The report also provided new details about a meeting that campaign advisers Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, Kushner and Manafort held with a Russian lawyer at New York’s Trump Tower in June 2016. The meeting was set up after the advisers were promised “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic challenger for president. Mueller’s team considered whether the advisers violated laws barring election contributions from foreigners. But, the report says, they ultimately decided there was not enough evidence to show they “wilfully” broke the law and they might have had problems proving the information offered on Clinton was really valuable. When news of the Trump Tower meeting broke in July 2017, Trump Jr. issued a statement saying the meeting was set up to discuss adoption policy, not politics, before later admitting he had been expecting intelligence on Clinton.  Such interactions have broadly been referred to by Democratic congressional investigators as examples of possible “collusion”. But because collusion is not a legal term, Mueller’s team examined the Trump Tower meeting and other contacts through the lens of federal conspiracy law. Mueller said his investigation was unable to establish that such contacts with Russians met the bar of criminality which required that the contacts “amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation” of U.S. laws, including those governing campaign finance and foreign agent registration. Therefore, Mueller said his office “did not charge any individual associated with the Trump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts.” Reporting by Mark Hosenball, Nathan Layne, Sarah N.

261,"Mueller reveals Trump's staff, associates sometimes ignored him - Reuters","April 18, 2019 /  10:27 PM / 19 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report released on Thursday detailed more than just Oval Office arguments and Trump Tower meetings.      It also revealed that Trump’s staff and associates frequently ignored the president - disregarding his orders and hoping he just wouldn’t ask again. Trump called White House Chief Counsel Don McGahn twice and told him to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that Mueller should be removed.  “Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the Special Counsel,” McGahn recalled Trump telling him.  But McGahn didn’t do it.  “To end the conversation with the President, McGahn left the President with the impression that McGahn would call Rosenstein,” Mueller wrote in his report. “McGahn recalled that he had already said no to the President’s request and he was worn down, so he just wanted to get off the phone.”   Trump frequently attempted to use staff and associates to deliver messages. But frequently, his attempts to send messages via a third party were ignored.  On June 19, 2017, Trump met in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Trump told Lewandowski to deliver a message to then Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he wanted the Mueller investigation limited to just potential interference in future elections. Lewandowski told Trump he would handle it, but instead he asked White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver the message. “(Dearborn) recalled later telling Lewandowski that he had handled the situation, but he did not actually follow through with delivering the message to Sessions,” Mueller wrote.  On Feb. 14, 2017, Trump had lunch with then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. During the lunch, the president asked Christie if he could deliver a message to then-FBI Director James Comey.  Trump wanted Christie to tell Comey that the president “really like(s) him. Tell him he’s part of the team,” the governor later told Mueller.  A month later, Trump fired Comey.  “Christie had no intention of complying with the president’s request that he contact Comey,” Mueller wrote. “He thought the president’s request was ‘nonsensical’ and Christie did not want to put Comey in the position of having to receive such a phone call. Christie thought it would have been uncomfortable to pass on that message.”  Long before Sessions resigned, Trump began searching for a new attorney general.  In July 2017, Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand came to Trump’s attention and he asked his then White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter to contact Brand to see if she was interested in becoming attorney general. “Later, the president asked Porter a few times in passing whether he had spoken to Brand, but Porter did not reach out to her because he was uncomfortable with the task,” Mueller wrote.  Porter ignored the president because he was concerned the inquiry was an attempt by Trump to fire Mueller, the special counsel’s office surmised. “Porter did not contact Brand because he was sensitive to the implications of that action and did not want to be involved in a chain of events associated with an effort to end the investigation or fire the Special Counsel,” the report said.

266,Rice Energy founder to drop lawsuit against energy producer EQT - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:35 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Toby Rice, the co-founder of Rice Energy, which was acquired by EQT Corp in 2017, said in a statement on Sunday he would drop his lawsuit against EQT after the U.S. oil and gas producer said it was not seeking to manipulate the outcome of his board challenge. Rice and his brother Derek have put forward a slate of nominees to challenge EQT’s board in a shareholder vote in July, arguing EQT has mismanaged the $6.7 billion acquisition of their company to the detriment of EQT investors. In a lawsuit last month, Rice also accused EQT of seeking to mislead its shareholders by portraying his board nominees as endorsing EQT’s existing board, and presenting their election as triggering covenants that would require EQT to repay early or refinance its debt. In a letter on Sunday to its management, EQT said the lawsuit was a distraction without merit, calling it “a tactic intended to distract focus from the company’s strong first quarter financial results and outstanding recent operational performance.” EQT said the Rice team had misinterpreted a “standard form director and officer questionnaire” and that it would not seek to conflate its board directors with the Rice nominees. It added it had no intention of triggering change of control provisions that would have required a debt refinancing or early repayment. In response, the Rice team said in its statement it was pleased “EQT has conceded that it must withdraw its unreasonable requirements” and that it was “deeply disappointed” that a lawsuit was needed to address the issue. The Rice team is continuing with its effort to overthrow EQT’s board. Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy. Despite its new scale, EQT’s share price has lagged since the merger, spurring the Rice brothers to call for changes. How the company develops its assets is at the heart of the dispute. The Rice brothers insist the current management has not fulfilled EQT’s potential, while the company insists the siblings’ projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions.

268,UPDATE 1-Wall St futures plunge after Trump threatens China with further tariffs - Reuters,"May 6, 2019 /  12:55 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Updates prices, adds commentary) By Sinéad Carew May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock index futures fell sharply in a volatile session on Sunday evening after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and soon target hundreds of billions more. After easing losses for a while, U.S. futures lost more ground and hit a fresh session low after the Wall Street Journal reported that China was considering canceling a round of U.S. talks set for this week because of Trump’s comments. Chinese officials were scheduled to meet their U.S. counterparts in Washington on Wednesday after meeting in Beijing last week for a round that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described as “productive.” Investors pulled back from riskier bets on fears the trade battle between the world’s biggest economies was escalating, especially since recent gains in U.S. equities were at least partly due to optimism they would reach a deal. “I think the president feels China is dragging its feet,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “He’s trying to pressure China into a deal. It’s a stupid move. The Chinese are going to be thinking this is negotiating in a bad faith way.” After falling as much as 1.92% on the prospect that China would cancel meetings, S&P futures then steadied slightly. S&P 500 e-minis were down 54.75 points, or 1.86%, with 175,429 contracts changing hands. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 168 points, or 2.14%, in volume of 46,116 contracts and Dow e-minis were down 484 points, or 1.83%, with 26,617 contracts changing hands. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut said China’s reaction to Trump’s would be the next big catalyst for investors who may see the President’s comments as a negotiating tactic. “The next important thing is the reaction from China. Should China cancel the trip that becomes a bigger problem. People came into this weekend expecting there was a good chance we’d have a trade deal next Friday,” said O’Rourke. “A deal with China has already been essentially priced in, if not fully. A large portion of the market will give the situation the benefit of the doubt to see what China’s reaction is. If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.” The S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. “I do think it’s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,” said Rick Meckler, Partner, Cherry Lane Investments,  New Vernon, New Jersey.

U.S. President Donald Trump sharply escalated trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies with tweeted comments on Sunday that talks toward a trade deal with China were proceeding “too slowly”, and that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion of goods to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent. He also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs “shortly”. The tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of robust growth in China and the United States, and from comments from Trump and other senior U.S. officials that trade talks were going well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China was considering cancelling trade talks scheduled for this week following Trump’s threats. “President Trump just killed the trade deal for a while and that has implications for Chinese and global growth, it also has implications for a number of assets,” Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro said in a morning note to clients. In early Asian trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.2 percent. Australian shares were 0.6 percent lower in early trade. Japanese financial markets remain closed until Tuesday for a national holiday, but Nikkei 225 futures dropped 1.8 percent to 22,085. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent after the U.S. payroll data had helped to lift Wall Street stocks on Friday. Investors around Asia will be keeping an eye on Chinese markets, which open at 0130 following a three-day national holiday last week.

Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he will hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marked a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in trade talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Wall Street Journal reported sources saying Beijing might cancel talks with their U.S. counterparts in Washington planned for Wednesday. Investors responded by bidding up the yen, which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge hoard of assets abroad. The dollar eased to 110.65 yen on the WSJ report. Earlier it touched a five-week trough at 110.53 on Reuters dealing, after ending Friday around 111.12. The market was again thin as Japan remains on holiday, though China is back from its break. The euro hit its lowest since January around 123.44 yen and was last at 123.75. The single currency was steady on the dollar at $1.1185, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 97.548. The dollar climbed 1 percent on the Chinese yuan to 6.8038 . The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last down at $0.6972. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.7 percent in and Treasury futures jumped 18 ticks. Nikkei futures were down 2 percent at 22,050, though the cash market will not open until Tuesday. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy.

274,Mueller report provides intimate scenes from the Trump White House - Reuters,"April 18, 2019 /  5:41 PM / 19 days ago","5 Min Read (Note: Story includes language throughout that will offend some readers.) By Ginger Gibson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report builds upon dozens of interviews, notes and communications to piece together what was happening inside President Donald Trump’s White House. Here are some of those scenes: Attorney General Jeff Sessions broke the news to Trump on May 17, 2017, that Rod Rosenstein had appointed Robert Mueller to be the special counsel.  Sessions was with Trump in the Oval Office conducting interviews for a new FBI director but stepped outside when Rosenstein called to give him the news.   Trump slumped in his chair after Sessions returned and informed him of the appointment, according to notes taken at the time by Jody Hunt, who was Session’s chief of staff, and provided to Mueller’s team.  “Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked,” Trump said. Trump then turned his anger toward Sessions.  “You were supposed to protect me,” Sessions recalled Trump telling him. Trump then again bemoaned the potential fallout of a special counsel.  “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me,” Trump then said, according to both Hunt and Sessions.  Chief of Staff John Kelly detailed a “tense” Oval Office meeting he convened the morning of Feb. 6, 2018, to try to smooth things over between Trump and White House Counsel Don McGahn.  Months earlier, McGahn had been on the brink of resigning when he said Trump told him to get rid of Special Counsel Mueller. Now, Trump was angry because the New York Times and Washington Post had written articles about McGahn’s refusal to fire Mueller. “I never said to fire Mueller,” Trump began the meeting, according to McGahn’s retelling to Mueller. “I never said ‘fire.’ This story doesn’t look good. You need to correct this. You’re the White House counsel.” McGahn refused, saying that the article in the Times was accurate. “Did I say the word ‘fire’?” Trump then said, according to accounts by both McGahn and Kelly. McGahn said he responded, “What you said is, ‘Call Rod (Rosenstein), tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and can’t be the Special Counsel.’” “I never said that,” McGahn recalled Trump saying.  On Valentine’s Day 2017, Trump had lunch with then-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Trump told Christie, who had become an ally of the president early in the campaign, that the firing of Michael Flynn, the former national security aide, was going to solve his problems.  “Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over,” Trump told Christie, the governor recalled.  Christie laughed and told the president he expected they would still be discussing Russia a year later. “That was the problem. I fired Flynn. It’s over,” Trump countered. Christie, a former U.S. attorney, then told the president that he should not talk about the investigation, even if frustrated, and that he was going to be stuck with the Flynn story for a long time.  “Like gum on the bottom of your shoe,” Christie said.  As Trump flew from Saudi Arabia to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he reached into his pocket and produced a resignation letter that had been written two days earlier by Sessions.  Trump showed the letter to senior advisers, including Hope Hicks, who recalled the scene to Mueller’s team.  The letter had already become a point of concern among Trump’s aides. Sessions had delivered the letter to Trump the day before, but ultimately Trump and the attorney general had determined he would remain in the job. White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus were concerned that Trump was holding on to the letter and that he would use it as leverage against the Justice Department. The two top aides decided to try to get it back.  The president had the Justice Department “by the throat,” Priebus said. But when Preibus approached Trump on the Middle East trip and asked him to turn it over, the president insisted it wasn’t with him. Instead, Trump claimed, it was somewhere in the White House residence.  It would take another 10 days - three days after Trump returned from his trip - for the president finally turned it over.

275,Factbox: Long-awaited Mueller report is finally out. Now what? - Reuters,"April 18, 2019 /  4:43 PM / in 19 days","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report on Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election was publicly unveiled on Thursday, capping a 22-month investigation that President Donald Trump repeatedly labeled a “witch hunt.” The inquiry found no evidence that Trump’s 2016 campaign team engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia, and Mueller was unable to draw a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump did not commit the crime, but Mueller’s report recounted 10 episodes involving Trump and evaluated whether obstruction of justice occurred. Here are likely next steps in a saga that has dogged Trump since his election and is likely to continue into 2020 as he seeks re-election: Trump may try to campaign on the Mueller investigation, which many fellow Republicans think was an effort by the FBI to unseat him. His rallying cry that the investigation was a witch hunt to remove a democratically elected president could be effective in mobilizing his supporters, many of whom are already leery of Washington, to back him for a second term in office. Trump wasted no time trying to get the political edge on Thursday. Hours before Mueller’s report was released he posted on Twitter: “The Greatest Political Hoax of all time! Crimes were committed by Crooked, Dirty Cops and DNC/The Democrats.” Democratic presidential candidates have said little about the Mueller investigation, which has deeply divided an already polarized America. The question now is whether the release of the report will tempt them to comment, although that risks a bruising, and possibly losing, Twitter battle with Trump.  Polls show that voters are much more concerned about bread and butter issues surrounding the economy than the investigation. As a result, there may be little upside to Democratic candidates, especially in battleground districts dominated by moderate voters, seeking political advantage through the report. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are examining Trump’s business practices and financial dealings, according to testimony delivered to Congress in February by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who faces a three-year prison term for crimes related to payments arranged to women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. The prosecutors have wider latitude to investigate than Mueller and they will be operating independent of him. New indictments by federal prosecutors in New York could overshadow the Mueller report. The Mueller report noted that it had made 14 criminal referrals that were outside the scope of the special counsel’s authority. The report said evidence was sent to “appropriate law enforcement authorities,” mainly other offices within the Department of Justice and the FBI. The chances of Democrats in the House of Representatives moving to impeach Trump diminished last month when Barr announced Mueller had found no evidence of collusion with Russia. But the details of Mueller’s findings might add new fuel for launching impeachment proceedings that have been conducted only three times in U.S. history.  An impeachment effort would focus on whether Trump may have committed “high crimes and misdemeanors.” That is a broad definition that gives Congress greater latitude than Mueller’s stricter investigative mandate. Nevertheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat, said weeks before the report’s release that she opposes impeachment, saying it would be too divisive to the nation. Given that no Republicans have shown interest in impeachment so far, any such effort likely would fizzle in the Senate where their support would be needed for a conviction - unless the report changes some minds. Nevertheless, some liberal Democrats have continued to press for impeachment. Many Democrats demanded a full report with no portions blacked out, or redacted. The House Judiciary Committee could issue subpoenas demanding the full, unredacted report and related documents, as well as testimony gathered by Mueller from some of Trump’s former top White House aides. If that action is taken, it is not clear whether the Justice Department would comply with the subpoenas. If not, this struggle could end up being arbitrated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Attorney General William Barr, the nation’s top law enforcement officer, is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 2. Democrats will try to dig deeper into Mueller’s findings, while Republicans likely will defend Trump and argue that Mueller’s findings vindicate him. Mueller is expected to testify in an open House Judiciary Committee hearing, but not until after Barr’s appearance. Besides reviewing Mueller’s findings, Democrats are pursuing other avenues for congressional probes into Trump’s dealings as a businessman before he became president and since he moved into the White House in 2017. For example, the House Ways and Means Committee set an April 23 deadline for the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to provide six years of Trump’s individual and business tax filings. Democrats think the forms could give clues to Trump’s possible business dealings with Russia. Failure to meet that deadline could prompt the House to hold administration officials in contempt of Congress, triggering legal maneuvers to get the agency to comply. The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee has yet to release findings of its own in-depth investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 elections. That could come later this year. Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee is ramping up its probe now that Democrats are in control. House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees have been seeking documents relating to Trump’s conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Oversight panel also has been looking into security clearance issues involving Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and others.

276,UPDATE 1-U.S. stock futures tumble after Trump threatens China with steeper tariffs - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  11:24 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(Updates with price update, commentary, background) By Sinéad Carew May 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street stock index futures fell sharply on Sunday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and soon target hundreds of billions more. Trump’s announcement came ahead of another round of talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Washington scheduled for this week. White House officials were unaware on Sunday afternoon if Trump’s tweet would affect those talks. The Chinese delegation could decide not to come because of what is likely to be seen as an escalation by the president. Investors were taking risk off the table on concerns that Trump’s threat would halt progress in talks between the world’s biggest economies, especially since some recent gains in U.S. equities were due to optimism they would reach a deal. “It’s obviously not good news for the market. The administration had sent signals an agreement was close before. This causes us to question how close we are,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. While S&P futures eased their losses they were still down on as the evening wore on. After falling as much as 1.8%, S&P 500 e-minis were down 40 points, or 1.36%, with 93,139 contracts changing hands. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 119 points, or 1.51%, in volume of 21,736 contracts and Dow e-minis were down 358 points, or 1.35%, with 14,154 contracts changing hands. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut said investors may not panic completely yet as they could see Trump’s comments as a negotiating tactic. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we catch a bounce between now and tomorrow morning. With the president it could be a negotiating tactic,” said O’Rourke. If this week’s scheduled meetings were canceled, pressure on equities could ramp up, he said. “The next important thing is the reaction from China. Should China cancel the trip that becomes a bigger problem. People came into this weekend expecting there was a good chance we’d have a trade deal next Friday,” said O’Rourke. “A deal with China has already been essentially priced in, if not fully. A large portion of the market will give the situation the benefit of the doubt to see what China’s reaction is. If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.” The S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. “I do think it’s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,” said Cherry Lane’s Meckler.

277,FOREX-Yen jumps in Asia as Trump tariff threat slams risk assets - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:47 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read* Yen up across the board in choppy trading * Trumps threatens China with higher, more tariffs * U.S. stocks futures dive, Treasuries well bid By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 6 (Reuters) - The safe-haven yen jumped in early Asian trading on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to increase tariffs on China, sending risk assets into a spin and slamming stock futures. Trump on Sunday increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal by announcing he will hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon. The announcement via Twitter marks a major shift in tone from Trump, who has cited good progress in the talks and praised his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Investors responded by bidding up the yen which is considered a safe harbour in times of stress given Japan’s status as the world’s largest creditor and its huge assets abroad. The dollar initially fell to a five-week trough at 110.53 on Reuters dealing, having ended Friday around 111.12. It was last at 110.71, with the market again thin as Japan remains on holiday. The euro hit its lowest since January at 123.44 yen , before steadying around 123.84. The single currency was a touch lower on the dollar at $1.1183, while the dollar index was little changed at 97.536. The Australian dollar took a spill given the country’s exposure to Chinese trade and lost around 0.6 percent at one stage to $0.6960. It was last holding at $0.6986. “An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would threaten the prospect of a global growth recovery,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “AUD and NZD are lower at the open as we await for Asian markets to open,” he added. “An aggressive response from China that halts current negotiations, with higher tariffs by the end of the week would be a disaster for risk assets.” As a taste of what was to come, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 slid 1.57 percent in early trade and Treasury futures jumped 17 ticks. The U.S. dollar had already softened on Friday when jobs data beat expectations but a soft reading for wages meant the Federal Reserve could afford to stay patient on policy.

279,Fed faces tough sell on inflation framework - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:57 PM / 2 days ago","5 Min ReadPALO ALTO, Calif., May 5 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers fear they are ill-equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation-targeting approach, and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs. But for the U.S. central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in Palo Alto Friday to discuss available options, the challenge was clear: not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits, figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge. Indeed, just to explain their ideas to each other, Fed policymakers and academics at the Hoover Institution’s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations, lengthy bullet points, and nearly indecipherable charts. And while most of the PhD economists in the audience presumably understood the theories, “I think where people disagree is, do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life?” Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. In other words, what will really work? When central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they thought they were facing once-in-a-lifetime conditions. But a decade on from the end of the Great Recession, it’s clear the Fed is dealing with a new economic norm. Neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with U.S. unemployment at a near 50-year low. That leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had. So this year, with the U.S. economy on an even keel, interest rate policy on pause, and an expansion set to reach record length this summer, Fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along. Among the ideas: commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above-target inflation; rely on simple policy rules to take the guesswork out of rate decisions; and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns. All would, their advocates say, act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions. Each would differ, to greater or lesser degrees, from the Fed’s current approach, by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment. And all would depend critically on households, businesses and financial markets understanding the framework, and reacting accordingly. Average inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far. The idea, New York Fed President John Williams explained, is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period - say, a year and a half. When inflation falls during periods of economic stress, the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time. If households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future, they will borrow and spend more during recessions, which would theoretically speed the economy’s return to health. But for the plan to work, spenders will have to believe the Fed really will drive inflation higher in the future. Negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy; if they just keep their money at the bank, they’ll end up paying for the privilege. For such a regime to be accepted, however, ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn’t be punished as well. Policy rules boost Fed credibility by laying out a clear path for rates based on the economy, Cleveland Fed’s Mester said. But if those rules are applied too rigidly, they won’t deliver the outcomes the Fed wants. Not everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework, not even the Fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas. “The bar for change is high,” San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly said. “It can be costly to make mistakes in this space.” St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard went further: experimenting with the way the world’s biggest central bank does business “would unleash chaos” in global financial markets. Still, the group seemed keen on exploring new ideas, and the Fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year. Most in the audience gave the Fed credit for tackling the issue. Said Dartmouth College economics professor Andy Levin, “The Fed needs to find something new.” Reporting by Ann Saphir and Howard Schneider; Editing by

280,RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Record-breaking rally leaving energy stocks behind - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  5:03 PM / 2 days ago","5 Min Read(Repeats story that ran on Friday) By David Randall NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The stock market surge since the start of the year that has sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up to new record highs is leaving behind one sector that typically outperforms in an expanding economy: energy. A sharp rebound in the price of oil has not been enough to offset a long-standing reluctance on the part of investors to hold energy companies after prices collapsed in 2014. Energy companies in the S&P 500 are down 13% over the last year, while the broad index is up 10%. Over the last 5 years, energy companies have sunk 31%, while the S&P 500 as a whole is up nearly 60%. Weak gasoline and petrochemical margins along with record U.S. crude production have weighed on refiners and integrated oil companies this year, yet fund managers and analysts say that energy stocks must also jump the high hurdle of negative investor sentiment before they can catch up to or even lead the broad market higher. “There’s still an overhang from investors feeling like they have been burned in this cycle before,” said Trip Rodgers, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy BP Energy fund. “There’s only so many times you can get caught off-guard before you start to feel skeptical that higher prices are here to stay.” That sense of trepidation on the part of investors has helped extend the disconnect between the price of oil and the performance of energy stocks, he said. Oil prices are up by more than 35% since the start of the year, due in part to higher-than-expected global demand, production cuts from OPEC and the effect of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. Economists expect the price of both Brent crude and U.S. light crude to stay above $60 for the rest of this year, according to the latest Reuters poll. Yet energy companies continue to lag the broader market, with the S&P 500 energy sector down 3.6% since the start of the quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 3% over the same time, and notched a new record high on Wednesday. Investors will need to see consistent oil prices above $60 a barrel and more “capital discipline” on the part of energy companies before they start to move back into the sector, Rogers said. As a result, he has been focusing on companies that are improving their balance sheets and keeping their costs low despite the gain in the commodity price, he said. Energy Transfer LP, Diamondback Energy Inc, and Parsley Energy Inc are among his largest positions. Noah Barrett, an analyst who works on several funds at Janus Henderson Investors, said the outsized gap between the gain in oil prices and the muted performance of energy stocks may help fuel a “catch-up trade” later this year. Yet for that to happen, companies must prove to investors that they can keep a lid on spending, he said. “Particularly among the larger-cap companies, you’re hearing this message of ‘Trust us, we’re focused on generating free cash flow and giving a portion of that back to shareholders instead of plowing it back into the field,’” Barrett said. “That’s a good message but it’s something they can only say for a quarter or two. Because of the history of this industry, this is something that will take multiple quarters, if not years, for investors to believe.” Overall, institutional investors appear to be taking a slightly more bullish stance on energy stocks than retail investors. Global fund managers have a 3% overweight to the sector, well below the overweights of 10% or more that fund managers held through much of 2017 and 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The growth of alternative energy and the popularity of electronic vehicle makers like Tesla Inc are contributing some to the subdued performances of energy companies, said Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group. Yet those concerns will likely fade if oil prices can sustain these relatively high prices, proving to investors that they will not be once again fall victim to a false rally, he said. “Energy stocks are still pricing in a risk premium, even though energy prices are ramping up,” he said.

281,South Africa's ruling ANC vows to act on corruption; EFF promises radical reforms - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  1:05 PM / 2 days ago","5 Min ReadJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) will kick-start the economy and deal with corruption, it vowed on Sunday, three days before elections at which its overwhelming majority faces its sternest test since the party rose to power. Less than 30 km (18.6 miles) away, the country’s second-biggest opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), challenged the ANC’s governance record and promised a tougher stance on corruption and economic policies to target racial  inequality. Though the ANC has won each parliamentary election since the transition from apartheid in 1994, recent opinion polls predict that it will bleed support to opposition coalitions that have gained ground as the ANC has been dogged by political scandal and a flagging economy. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who took over from scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as ANC leader in December 2017, told about 70,000 supporters packed into Johannesburg’s Ellis Park Stadium on Sunday that the party would punish members guilty of stealing public money. A judicial corruption inquiry that began in 2018 has heard chilling evidence of how top officials took bribes from local and multinational companies in exchange for lucrative contracts from state firms. “We are determined that those found guilty of corruption or involvement in state capture will not be allowed to occupy positions of responsibility, either in the ANC, in parliament or in government,” Ramaphosa said at Sunday’s rally.  “The era of impunity is over. We are now entering the era of accountability.” The torrent of allegations has hit ANC support, especially in urban areas. The EFF, formed by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema in 2013, has built its agenda on highlighting state graft and championing radical economic reforms the ANC has avoided, such as mine nationalization and land expropriation without compensation.  “The reign of thieves must fall, the reign of Ramaphosa must fall,” Malema chanted at a rally of about 40,000 supporters in Johannesburg township Soweto. “The EFF doesn’t have tolerance for corruption.”           Three opinion polls in recent weeks show the ANC’s support ranging between 51 and 61 percent, compared with the 62 percent it won in 2014.  The EFF won 10 percent of the vote in 2014 national elections. In local elections in 2016 it captured 12 percent, allowing it to play kingmaker in urban regions where neither of the top two parties managed to get past 50 percent.  Analysts said it was telling that the ANC, as well as the two largest opposition parties - the Democratic Alliance (DA) and EFF - held their final campaign rallies in Gauteng. Despite being the province with the smallest land area, Gauteng generates more than a third of South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is the most populous province with a population of 14.3 million. In 2016 local polls the ANC lost control of the three largest metropolitan municipalities - economic hub Johannesburg, administrative capital Pretoria, both in Gauteng, and Nelson Mandela Bay in the eastern province. Ramaphosa said the ANC would revive economic growth and ease unemployment, which sits at more than 27 percent, by hitting an investment target of 1.4 trillion rand ($100 billion) and limiting policy uncertainty. “It has never been done before in South Africa and only the ANC will be able to mobilize these kind of resources,” Ramaphosa said. South Africa’s economic growth has slowed sharply in recent years, averaging about 2 percent in the past decade, while medium-term GDP is seen around 1 percent, well below the 4-5 percent needed to dent rising poverty and joblessness. Malema said the EFF would grow the economy in favor of black Africans and the youth by doubling child grants, offering free university education and nationalizing key industries. “Political freedom without economic freedom is meaningless,” Malema said, referring to wealth and income inequality that has remained racially skewed and the slow progress of the ANC’s policies of affirmative action and macroeconomic orthodoxy. “We are not fighting white people. We are fighting to eat from the same dinner table,” Malema said.  “If we cannot eat from that dinner table, we will destroy the entire table.” Reporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by David GoodmanAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

283,Turkey to rule on Istanbul election re-run appeal on Monday: AKP candidate - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:25 AM / 2 days ago","5 Min ReadANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s High Election Board will rule on Monday on an appeal by President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party (AKP) calling for a re-run of the Istanbul local elections that the party narrowly lost, the AKP’s mayoral candidate in the city said. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) won control of the capital Ankara and Istanbul, the country’s biggest city, for the first time in 25 years in the March 31 local elections, in a major electoral setback for the president. Erdogan’s ruling AKP and its nationalist MHP allies have since called for the results in Istanbul to be annulled and the election to be re-run, citing what they say are irregularities that affected the outcome. While those appeals have been pending for weeks, the High Election Board (YSK) ordered partial and full recounts across Istanbul. Istanbul’s new CHP mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, took office last month as the recounts were completed. However, in its interim ruling on the objections, the YSK ordered district electoral officials to inspect their respective polling station officials. Prosecutors also launched probes into the alleged irregularities, calling 100 polling station workers in for questioning as suspects. “The YSK (High Election Board) has examined our party’s and the MHP’s objections to the Istanbul election results. I believe it will make a decision tomorrow,” AKP candidate and former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters. On Saturday, Erdogan signaled he favors a re-run of the Istanbul elections, which he said were marred by controversy, and added that renewing the vote would allow the YSK to “clear its name”. AKP Deputy Chairman Ali Ihsan Yavuz later on Sunday told broadcaster A Para that the party was preparing to file criminal complaints on the irregularities, but that it would wait for the YSK’s ruling. “With this many illegalities, the prosecutors won’t be able to rest. We formed a team to file criminal complaints,” Yavuz said. Yavuz also said the AKP would file a new appeal to the YSK to block individuals dismissed through government decrees after a July 2016 coup attempt from being able to vote. The YSK rejected a previous appeal by the AKP on the same issue. The state-run Anadolu news agency said on Sunday that authorities had found 43 polling station officials had links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the failed coup, as a result of the investigations into alleged election irregularities. It said 41 of the suspects in Istanbul had deposited money into Bank Asya, a lender started by Gulen’s followers, and two had used ByLock, an encrypted messaging system Ankara says was used by Gulen’s network. Anadolu said the investigations were still underway. While the CHP won the mayorship in Istanbul, the AKP won most of the districts and earned the majority of seats in the municipal council. The AKP says this proves the irregularities, but Imamoglu said on Saturday that the people could “only laugh at this”.  Speaking to supporters in Istanbul on Sunday, Imamoglu said the elections were over and the results were clear. He said he believed the YSK would make a decision to safeguard Turkey’s future. “It has been 36 days since the elections ended. Some people are doing everything they can for the Istanbul vote not to be concluded,” Imamoglu said. “You are elected, even if it is by one vote.” “Appealing is a democratic right, we understand this. But they find new excuses everyday,” he said. “The history of the world hasn’t seen a comedy like this.” CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has accused Erdogan’s AKP and the MHP of putting political pressure on the YSK to re-run the Istanbul election. Erdogan dismissed the accusations, saying his party was only exercising its legal rights. The uncertainty over the results in Istanbul, which accounts for around a third of the country’s economy, has kept financial markets on edge, as Turkey tries to recover from a currency crisis that saw the lira lose more than 30 percent of its value last year.

284,India sees little scope for Jet Airways revival: government sources - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:42 AM / 2 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s government sees little hope of a bidder emerging for debt-laden Jet Airways Ltd, two senior finance ministry officials said, even as thousands of employees plead with the government for a rescue. Parties that had initially expressed interest in Jet, which is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of debt, have so far failed to make firm bids to bail it out, increasing the odds that it could soon face bankruptcy proceedings. “There is little scope in the revival of Jet,” said one official, adding that if a bidder emerged, the government was still willing to return slots to the private airline which have temporarily been given to rivals. A second senior finance ministry official said it was only a matter of time before someone dragged Jet to the National Company Law Tribunal - India’s bankruptcy court - for recovery of dues from Jet. It will most likely be one of Jet’s creditors and not its lenders that do so, said both the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Unions have been pleading with the government to ensure the airline is rescued. Last week, in a letter to the prime minister seen by Reuters, its pilots union urged the government to intervene and speed up the bid process for the airline and stop the deregistration of its aircraft by its lessors. Jet had a fleet of more than 120 aircraft but more than half have been deregistered and repossessed by lessors.  India’s aviation authorities have also been temporarily farming out Jet’s slots to rival carriers as airfares have soared in the wake of Jet’s shutdown. Rival low-cost carriers have also been scooping up aircraft that were formerly operated by Jet from its lessors, and poaching hundreds of its pilots, cabin crew and other staffers. The airline halted operations on April 17 after its lenders refused to provide further funds to keep it afloat. Once India’s largest private carrier, it had more than 16,000 employees and flights to dozens of international destinations. State Bank of India (SBI) said last month that it expected bidders to submit binding bids by April 30, and to complete the sale process this month. However, bankers involved in the process told Reuters last week that no binding bids had emerged. “The banks have been advised to wait for the formation of the next government ... before taking any decision on Jet’s fate,” the official told Reuters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently seeking re-election. His government has come under fire from critics and opposition parties for rising unemployment. Despite this, senior government officials have opposed any bailout package for the airline arguing it would increase pressure to support other failed private companies. The government is satisfied with the handling of the Jet crisis by banks and other institutions as it has thus far not become a major election issue, the second ministry official said. Jet’s borrowings are small compared to those of other big defaulters such as Videocon and some steel companies, so lenders likely can wait for some more time before commencing bankruptcy proceedings, the official said. An official at ICICI Bank, which has to recover over 5.4 billion rupees ($78.17 million) from Jet, said the bank sees little chance of any recovery without the government coming up with a rescue plan.  “We largely think our money in Jet is gone,” he said.

288,India sees little scope for Jet Airways revival - govt sources - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  10:40 AM / in 2 days","1 Min ReadNEW DELHI, May 5 (Reuters) - The Indian government sees little hope of a bidder emerging for debt-laden Jet Airways Ltd , which halted operations last month, two senior finance ministry officials said. Parties that had initially expressed interest in Jet, which is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion of debt, have so far failed to come forward with firm bids to bail it out, increasing odds that it could soon face bankruptcy proceedings. “There is little scope in the revival of Jet,” said one official, adding that if a bidder emerged, the government was still willing to restore slots to the private airline that had been temporarily given to rivals. The second official said it was only a matter of time before someone dragged the carrier to the National Company Law Tribunal - India’s bankruptcy court - for recovery of dues.

Asked if he trusted May, McDonnell said: “No, sorry. Not after this weekend when she’s blown the confidentiality...

290,Turkey says it will not bow to U.S. sanctions over S-400 deal - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:47 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min ReadANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will never bow to U.S. sanctions over its agreement to purchase Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile defense systems, Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Sunday regarding a deal that has strained ties between the NATO allies. Washington says the systems are not compatible with NATO equipment and may compromise its Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets. It has warned of possible U.S. sanctions if Ankara pushes on with the Russian deal.  Turkey, a prospective buyer and a partner in the production of the F-35s, has said the S-400s and jets would not impact each other and that it will not abandon its deal with Russia.  It has proposed forming a working group with Washington to assess the impact of the S-400s, but says it has not received a response yet. Speaking to broadcaster Kanal 7, Oktay said the U.S. concerns are unreasonable and that the planned July delivery date for the S-400s remained unchanged. “When Turkey signs an agreement, Turkey keeps its promise. We signed this agreement and certain payments were made,” Oktay said. “I don’t think the arguments and concerns here have a lot to lean on,” he said. The United States has also offered to sell Turkey its rival Raytheon Co. Patriot defense systems, which Turkey’s Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara was still evaluating. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who will visit Turkey next week, told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency on Sunday that decisions about defense procurement were up to individual countries. “The issue of procuring military materiel is a national decision for countries, but the ability of allied armies to work together is a fundamental issue for NATO to run its operations and missions,” Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. He said he welcomed talks between Ankara and Washington on the procurement of the Patriot systems and talks between Turkey and the Franco-Italian EUROSAM consortium on its SAMP-T systems. In March Reuters reported Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, angered by Ankara’s refusal to back down from its planned purchase of the Russian missile system. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that the F-35 project would collapse if Turkey did not participate. Turkey has said it expected U.S. President Donald Trump to use a waiver to protect it against penalties over the S-400s, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Ankara could face retribution for the deal under the U.S. Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

291,Turkey board to rule on Istanbul election re-run appeal -AKP candidate - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  8:22 AM / 2 days ago","2 Min ReadANKARA, May 5 (Reuters) - A ruling on an appeal by Turkey’s AK Party (AKP) calling for a re-run of the Istanbul mayoral election will be made on Monday by the High Election Board (YSK), the AKP’s candidate said. The main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) won control of the capital Ankara and Istanbul, the country’s biggest city, for the first time in 25 years in March 31 local elections. President Tayyip Erdogan’s AKP and their nationalist MHP allies have called for the results in Istanbul to be annulled and re-run citing what they say are irregularities. The YSK has ordered recounts across Istanbul and in its interim ruling it ordered district electoral officials to inspect their respective polling station officials. “The YSK has examined our party’s and the MHP’s objections to the Istanbul election results. I believe it will make a decision tomorrow,” said AKP candidate Binali Yildirim, a former prime minister. He spoke to reporters after morning prayers on Sunday, the first day of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. On Saturday, Erdogan signalled he favours a re-run of the Istanbul elections, which he said were marred by controversy and irregularities, adding that renewing the vote would allow the YSK to “clear its name”. Istanbul’s new CHP mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said on Saturday that the objections were unreasonable and that they could “only laugh at this”. CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu has said the Istanbul elections had turned into a test for Turkish democracy. Erdogan had accused the opposition of supporting “terrorism” and labeled the local election a “matter of survival” for Turkey during his campaign, which was held amid growing disenchantment among voters over economic woes. The uncertainty over the results in Istanbul, which accounts for around a third of the country’s economy, has kept financial markets on edge, as Turkey tries to recover from a currency crisis that saw the lira lose more than 30 percent of its value last year.

292,Egypt non-oil private-sector activity expands for first time in 8 months -PMI - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  4:16 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min ReadCAIRO, May 5 (Reuters) - Egypt’s non-oil private-sector activity expanded for the first time in eight months in April, and saw its highest reading since August 2015, a survey showed on Sunday. The Emirates NBD Egypt Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the non-oil private sector strengthened to 50.8 in April from 49.9 in March, breaching the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time since August last year. The April reading was the highest in over three-and-a-half years, and only the sixth reading in positive territory since. Analysts linked the improved overall business conditions largely to “greater market movement and an increase in demand,” the PMI report said. A sub-index for output also returned to expansion, rising to 51.1 in April from 49.9 in March. The upswing came after last month’s significant rise of over three points, reaching its highest since August. “The improvement from the first quarter – the PMI index averaged just 48.9 over January to March – was broad-based, with most of the index’s subcomponents returning positive 50-plus readings,” said Daniel Richards, MENA economist at Emirates NBD. The output sub-index was positive for the first time since November 2017 “as firms noticed stronger demand, and a positive reading for new orders for the second month in a row bodes well for this continuing over subsequent readings,” Richards said. New exports orders remained in contractionary territory, though rose to 48.9 in April from 46.8 in March. It was the slowest contraction since December. “Some firms noted a lack of new foreign contracts and a shift in focus towards domestic sales,” the report said, while “others saw higher demand from new markets such as Italy, Turkey and Japan.” Future output sentiment improved from March, and saw its second-highest reading in 12 months. Companies said “new projects, increased tourism and expansion into new foreign markets are likely to boost business activity,” the report said. “With input prices increasing at a faster rate than seen in March, firms’ margins will be squeezed by ongoing price discounting,” Richards said. “Nevertheless, they appear to be more confident with regards (to) future conditions”. “This greater optimism is reflected in their hiring, as employment returned a reading above 50.0 – albeit marginally – for the first time since 2015.” (Reporting by Yousef Saba Editing by Ros Russell)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

293,Elliott wants Whitbread to offload chunks of its property portfolio: Sunday Telegraph - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  10:31 PM / in 3 days","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Elliott Advisors has become increasingly frustrated with Whitbread Plc’s strategy of owning Premier Inn hotels outright and wants the company to offload chunks of its 5.8 billion pound ($7.64 billion) property portfolio, the Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the report on Saturday, the activist investor believes Whitbread’s strategy is “depressing” the company’s share price and is leaving it open to a cut-price hostile takeover. Citing city sources, the newspaper said Elliott wanted Whitbread to sell 10 to 15 percent of its hotel portfolio and “continue to be open minded about the rest”. The shareholder is also keen for Whitbread to bolster its board with directors having hotel industry experience, the Sunday Telegraph reported, adding that the company was searching for board members with experience of operating hotels in continental Europe. Last August, Whitbread agreed to sell its almost 4,000 Costa coffee shops to Coca-Cola Co for $5.1 billion after pressure from hedge funds, including activist investor Elliott, which said the coffee chain was held back by being grouped with the Premier Inn hotel chain. Whitbread and Elliott advisors did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the report.

294,"Warren Buffett defends Kraft, says Wells Fargo made 'big mistakes' - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  5:13 AM / 3 days ago","6 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled his commitment to Kraft Heinz Co and defended his actions toward Wells Fargo & Co, two of the largest investments at his Berkshire Hathaway Inc, despite mistakes at both that have caused many investors to sour on them. Buffett, 88, spoke before tens of thousands of people in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Berkshire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, fielded more than 50 shareholder and analyst questions for six hours at the centerpiece of a weekend of events. Kraft Heinz has been a thorn for Berkshire, which in February took a $3 billion writedown on its 26.7 percent stake, because of the packaged food company’s inability to keep up with changing consumer tastes and reliance on older brands such as Oscar Mayer and Jell-O. The company was created from the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, the latter of which had been owned by Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital, which runs Kraft Heinz day-to-day. Buffett defended 3G’s management, saying the combined company is doing well operationally, and that its current problems cannot be blamed on a lack of investment. But he also maintained that “we paid too much money” for Kraft. “You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much,” he said, while adding it was “not inconceivable” Berkshire could partner with 3G again on a transaction. He said 3G had more willingness to take on leverage and “pay up,” but in many cases also had “way better operators.” Buffett, who became famous in 1991 for criticizing Salomon Inc’s practices and becoming interim chairman to right the mess, also faced a question about his relative silence about Wells Fargo, where Berkshire owns a nearly 10-percent stake. Wells Fargo has spent more than 2-1/2 years addressing fallout from mistreating its customers, including by creating fake accounts, losing two chief executives in the process, including Tim Sloan in March. Buffett repeated that Wells Fargo “made some big mistakes” in its sales practices, and that “when you find a problem, you have to do something about it.” He also said chief executives who make big mistakes shouldn’t walk away with their wealth. But many questionable Wells Fargo practices long predated Sloan’s becoming chief executive, and Buffett and Munger have defended him. “I don’t think people ought to go to jail for honest errors of judgment,” Munger said, calling Sloan an “accidental casualty.” Berkshire also reported on Saturday that operating income, a measure of Berkshire’s business performance, rose 5 percent, helped by the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, though it fell just shy of analyst forecasts. Results excluded Kraft Heinz because that company has not released its own quarterly results, Buffett said. Berkshire also repurchased $1.7 billion of stock, reflecting Buffett’s difficulty in finding better uses for the company’s $114.2 billion cash hoard. Buffett acknowledged he would be willing to repurchase $100 billion of stock if it became cheap enough, and Munger predicted Berkshire would become “more liberal” with buybacks. “This much cash is certainly a drag” for Buffett, said Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners LLC in Memphis. “He and Charlie are certainly open that they missed it on several great businesses for many years. The purchases of Apple and Amazon are a good sign.” Berkshire owns more than $50 billion of Apple Inc stock, and Buffett said one of Berkshire’s portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, has invested in Amazon.com Inc. Munger also lamented Berkshire’s failure to invest in Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I feel like a horse’s ass for not identifying Google earlier.” Berkshire’s more than 90 businesses and roughly 389,000 employees make the company a barometer for the U.S. economy, and a report card for one of the world’s most revered investors. The shareholder weekend is not all business. Buffett on Saturday morning made his usual slow-motion crawl, with a crowd of photographers in tow, through an exhibit hall where shareholders could buy Berkshire-owned products, including 20,000 pounds of See’s candies and 28,752 Dairy Queen bars. “We love you Warren,” shareholders shouted as Buffett nibbled a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. People lined up before midnight to get early access to the best seats at the arena, which opened at 7 a.m. Daphne Kalir-Starr, 9, a fourth-grader from New York City, lined up with her father at 11 p.m. on Friday night, along with her sleeping bag. It’s her third time to see Buffett. “I really like hearing from great investors,” she said. “Even though he wasn’t really recognized at the beginning, he kept working at it.” Bela Chowdhury, 49, came from Kolkata, India, with other students from a nonprofit group that promotes financial literacy for women. “He is the ultimate guru,” she said. Meanwhile, Luke On, a University of Toronto finance undergraduate, said he lined up at 10 p.m. on Friday. “I have no place to stay and wanted to save money, but I wanted to see Warren and Charlie,” he said.

296,Warren Buffett: Berkshire discloses enough about itself - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  8:39 PM / 3 days ago","2 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb., May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday rejected a frequent criticism that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc does not disclose enough about its more than 90, often large operating businesses or its common stock investments. Buffett defended Berkshire’s disclosures in responding to three questions at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Meyer Shields, of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, is among the critics of Berkshire’s disclosures, saying in an April 28 report they leave investors “disproportionately reliant” on Buffett’s public persona and past investment successes rather than actual knowledge about the company. Berkshire owns or co-owns several companies, such as the BNSF railroad, large enough to be in the Fortune 500 on their own, yet which merit no more than a couple of pages in its quarterly and annual reports. Profit and revenue for many smaller units are not disclosed at all. Buffett said “I don’t think we actually provide less information” in periodic reports, but may present it in a different form. He insisted that overwhelming investors with technical information was the wrong idea, saying you can “lose people” in a 300-page report that says less than a 50-page report. Buffett also said Berkshire did not need to know the reasoning beyond its investments in stocks generally and foreign stocks, saying it might require the disclosure of proprietary strategies or would not be legally required.

Trump touts Putin’s “extremely strong and powerful” denial of meddling. He calls the Mueller inquiry a “rigged witch hunt” on Twitter. Aug. 21 - A trial jury in Virginia finds Manafort guilty of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failure to disclose a foreign bank account. - Cohen, in a case brought by U.S. prosecutors in New York, pleads guilty to tax fraud and campaign finance law violations. Cohen is subsequently interviewed by Mueller’s team. Aug. 31 - Samuel Patten, an American business partner of Kilimnik, pleads guilty to unregistered lobbying for pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine. Sept. 14 - Manafort pleads guilty to two conspiracy counts and signs a cooperation agreement with Mueller’s prosecutors. Nov. 8 - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigns at Trump’s request. He had recused himself from overseeing the Mueller inquiry because of his contacts with the Russian ambassador as a Trump campaign official. Trump appoints Sessions’ chief of staff Matthew Whitaker, a critic of the Mueller probe, as acting attorney general. Nov. 20 - Giuliani says Trump submitted written answers to questions from Mueller, as the president avoids a face-to-face interview with the special counsel. Nov. 27-28 - Prosecutors say Manafort breached his plea deal by lying to investigators, which Manafort denies. Trump says he has not ruled out granting Manafort a presidential pardon.  Nov. 28 - Giuliani says Trump told investigators he was not aware ahead of time of a meeting in Trump Tower in New York between several campaign officials and Russians in June 2016.   Nov. 29 - Cohen pleads guilty in the Mueller investigation to lying to Congress about the length of discussions in 2016 on plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. “I made these misstatements to be consistent with individual 1’s political messaging and out of loyalty to individual 1,” says Cohen, who previously identified “individual 1” as Trump. The president criticizes Cohen as a liar and “weak person.”  Dec. 12 - Two developments highlight growing political and legal risks for Trump: Cohen is sentenced to three years in prison for crimes including orchestrating hush payments to women in violation of campaign laws before the election; American Media Inc, publisher of National Enquirer tabloid, strikes a deal to avoid charges over its role in one of two hush payments. The publisher admits that the payment was aimed at influencing the 2016 election, contradicting Trump’s statements. Jan. 25 - Longtime Trump associate and self-proclaimed political “dirty trickster” Roger Stone is charged and arrested at his home in Florida. Stone is accused of lying to Congress about statements suggesting he may have had advance knowledge of plans by Wikileaks to release Democratic Party campaign emails that U.S. officials say were stolen by Russia. Feb. 14 - The Senate votes to confirm William Barr, Trump’s nominee to replace Sessions, as attorney general. Barr assumes broad authority over how much of the Mueller report to release. Feb. 22 - Manhattan district attorney’s office is pursuing New York state criminal charges against Manafort whether or not he receives a pardon from Trump on federal crimes. Trump cannot issue pardons for state convictions. Feb. 27 - Cohen tells U.S. House Oversight Committee Trump is a “racist,” a “con man” and a “cheat” who knew in advance about a release of emails by WikiLeaks in 2016 aimed at hurting rival Clinton. Trump directed negotiations for a real estate project in Moscow during the campaign even as he publicly said he had no business interests in Russia, Cohen testifies. March 7 - Manafort is sentenced in the Virginia case to almost four years in prison. The judge also ordered Manafort to pay a fine of $50,000 and restitution of just over $24 million. March 13 - Manafort is sentenced to about 3-1/2 more years in prison in the Washington case, bringing his total prison sentence in the two special counsel cases to 7-1/2 years. - Shortly after his sentencing in Washington, the Manhattan district attorney announces a separate indictment charging Manafort with residential mortgage fraud and other New York state crimes, which unlike the federal charges cannot be erased by a presidential pardon.  March 22 - Mueller submits his confidential report on the findings of his investigation to U.S. Attorney General William Barr. March 24 - Barr releases a summary of the “principal conclusions” of Mueller’s report and wrote that the investigation did not establish that members of Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russia. Mueller did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice, said Barr, who himself concluded the inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. March 25 - Democratic lawmakers demand that Barr send the full Mueller report and any underlying documents to Congress by April 2 and say the attorney general’s summary is not sufficient. The deadline is not met. April 3 - The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted to enable its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller’s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides. April 18 - This date is announced by the Justice Department for the release of a redacted version of the Mueller report.

300,Factbox: Smoke or fire? Contacts between Trump campaign and Russia - Reuters,"April 17, 2019 /  3:35 PM / in 19 days","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Attorney General William Barr is due on Thursday to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the 22-month investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Moscow. The special counsel and U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia used a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump’s candidacy. Russia has denied election interference. Barr said on March 24 Mueller did not establish that Trump’s 2016 campaign team engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia. Here are some key interactions between Trump advisers and Russian figures that have been unearthed by Mueller’s probe and investigations in Congress. Several top Trump aides, including campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr., met in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer who had offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. prosecutors said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was an agent for the Kremlin. The meeting was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist. Participants in the meeting said nothing improper occurred and that Veselnitskaya discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia and adoption policy, not election issues. The president said he did not know about the meeting beforehand. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he pursued a deal to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow until June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen said in a guilty plea that he spoke with an assistant to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary in January of that year and briefed Trump on the project more than three times. Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said the Moscow skyscraper talks continued until Trump won the November 2016 election, but later said he misspoke.  Trump, who repeatedly said during the campaign that he had no contacts with Russia, said after Cohen’s guilty plea in November 2018 there was nothing wrong with pursuing the deal. Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos worked between March 2016 and August 2016 to set up a meeting with Russian leadership, according to prosecutors. They said a London-based professor with ties to the Russian government told him in April 2016 that Moscow had compromising information on Clinton. Papadopoulos served 14 days in prison after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about those efforts. Manafort shared election campaign polling data in August 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner who Mueller has described as having ties to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by Manafort’s lawyers. The two also discussed a plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, a major Kremlin foreign policy goal as it seeks relief from U.S. economic sanctions, according to court filings.  Manafort, a veteran Republican political consultant who earned million of dollars working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, also offered private briefings about the campaign to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin, in an effort to collect past debts, according to the Washington Post. Roger Stone, a veteran Republican political consultant who has worked on and off with Trump for decades, shared with Trump campaign officials advance knowledge he had of a plan by the WikiLeaks website to release emails stolen from the Clinton campaign by Russians, prosecutors said. The charging document mentions that a senior Trump campaign official “was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information” WikiLeaks had about the Clinton campaign, raising the possibility Trump himself made the request. Stone pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and witness tampering.  Several Trump advisers met with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump became president.  They included: Michael Flynn, who served as Trump’s first White House national security advisor. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Kislyak in December 2016, after Trump won the election but before he took office. During those calls, according to the indictment, Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia and asked Kislyak to help delay a U.N. vote seen as damaging to Israel, a move that ran counter to the policies of then-President Barack Obama. Jeff Sessions, a U.S. senator serving as a campaign adviser who Trump later named attorney general, said he met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016 after initially telling Congress he was unaware of any communications between the campaign and Russia. As attorney general, Sessions recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, drawing Trump’s ire. The recusal by Sessions left Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, with oversight over the probe, which at the time was headed by the FBI. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to take over the probe. Kushner said he asked Kislyak if he could set up a secure communications channel at the Russian Embassy after Trump won the election. Kushner also said he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, during that period at Kislyak’s insistence. Vnesheconombank has been subjected to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014. Compiled by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Will Dunham and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

303,U.S. job growth surges; unemployment rate drops to 3.6 % - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:10 AM / in 4 days","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive stimulus from Republican tax cuts and spending increases fades. The Labor Department’s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the greater-than-expected 263,000 new jobs created last month were spread across most industry sectors, and the unemployment rate was just 3.6%, the lowest since December 1969.  Still, wage gains did not accelerate as expected, holding at  a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by the   most people leaving the labor force in a year and a half.  The report was supportive of the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the economy and job growth as “a bit stronger than we anticipated” and inflation “somewhat weaker.” “Employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy, while wage gains are not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve’s hand to tighten the policy stance,” said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. Aside from April’s surge in nonfarm payrolls, the economy created 16,000 more jobs in February and March than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185,000 jobs last month. The strong economy, especially the labor market, could boost President Donald Trump’s re-election hopes next year. Trump, who  has boasted about the economy being one of the major wins of his first term in office, cheered April’s robust employment gains. “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,” Trump tweeted. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. Job gains are well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The second month of strong employment growth put to rest concerns about a recession and ironically undercut Trump’s call for the Fed to cut interest rates. A brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March had fanned fears of an economic downturn, leading markets to price in a rate cut this year. “It would be awfully hard for the Fed to explain a rate cut given the strong job market, so forget that,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  Hiring remains strong, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries, suggesting there is still some spare capacity in the labor market.  Steadily rising wages had until recently been keeping workers in the labor force and drawing back some who had dropped out. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents, or 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.2% for a second straight month. Though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation, it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut wanes. The economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, driven by a surge in exports and inventories, quickening from the October-December period’s 2.2% pace. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while  U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Despite April’s robust job gains, there are signs the economy slowed early in the second quarter.  A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showed a measure of services industry activity dropped to a 20-month low in April. It followed on the heels of another ISM survey this week showing factory activity hitting a 2-1/2-year low last month.          Last month’s two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the  unemployment rate from 3.8 % in March was because 490,000 people left the labor force in April, the most in 18 months. It was the fourth straight month of workers dropping out of the labor force and could shrink the pool of available workers. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8% in April from 63.0% in March.  This suggested more slack in the labor market than indicated by the unemployment rate. The drop in participation was almost across the board, with significant declines among prime-age and younger workers. “The supply side of the economy looks a little less shiny in light of the decline in the participation rate,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 7.3% in April. Economists expect job growth will slow this year as fewer workers become available, which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target. An inflation measure tracked by the U.S. central bank increased 1.6% in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months. Employment at construction sites increased by 33,000 jobs in April, rising for a second straight month. Manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4,000 jobs after being unchanged in March. The industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang. The auto sector shed jobs for a fourth straight month. Employment increased in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and financial activities industries. But retail payrolls declined for a third straight month.  Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, rebounded last month after dropping in March. Government payrolls increased by 27,000 in April.  Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Dan BurnsAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

306,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo expects to refund monthly service fees to some customers - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:43 PM / 4 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds company comment, paragraphs 3-6) By Imani Moise May 3 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Friday it expects to refund some servicing fees to customers who may have been confused about how to avoid monthly charges. The San Francisco-based bank said in a securities filing it was reviewing past disclosures to consumers about mininum debit card activity requirements to waive certain monthly fees. Roughly 90 percent of customers successfully avoid paying servicing fees on checking accounts by meeting certain requirements, said Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz. Consumers can get waivers for the monthly fee by connecting a qualifying direct deposit or keeping the a minimum daily balance among other things. The bank has made changes to address guidelines for how to get a waiver through debit card use that had the potential to be confusing. “We have made improvements in how we communicate all of the ways customers qualify for a monthly service fee waiver, and how they can track their progress,” Seitz said. “It’s the right thing to do for our customers.” The disclosure adds to the long list of remediation efforts going on at the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets after a string of admissions that it may have improperly charged customers for various financial products. The bank became mired in scandal in 2016 when it revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Since then, issues have cropped up in each of Wells Fargo’s primary business segments. Wells Fargo has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has already paid out tens of millions of dollars to make consumers whole. In the same filing the company also raised the high end of potential losses in excess of the company’s accrual to $3.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion at the end of last year.

307,Puerto Rico oversight board sues over bond payment pledge - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:38 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadMay 3 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s longstanding pledge to pay off about $13 billion of outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds is just an unsecured promise, according to the latest lawsuits brought by the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board. Its action capped off a barrage of litigation this week that unsettled the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market, where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt. Complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico late on Thursday against GO bondholders, including mutual funds and other institutional and individual investors who contend they have a lien on the island government’s revenue. The board countered that Puerto Rico’s pledge of its “good faith, credit and taxing power” is “nothing more than a promise to pay” and that promise is not secured by any of the government’s property. Even if a lien existed under local law, it would be avoidable under bankruptcy law, according to the lawsuits. Defendants included BlackRock Financial Management, whose representative declined to comment. The lawsuits were filed ahead of the second anniversary of Puerto Rico’s May 3, 2017, bankruptcy, which seeks to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. They followed other litigation this week against hundreds of government vendors, as well as Wall street banks and firms that participated in the island’s bond sales. The board also went after certain GO bondholders in an attempt to recoup past debt service payments. James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors and a municipal bankruptcy expert, called the board’s attack against liens a probable negotiating ploy. “Clearly, there’s not a lot alleged as far as facts in there,” he said on Friday. While detailing “significant risks” for investors, the prospectus for $3.5 billion of GO bonds Puerto Rico sold in 2014 pointed to the commonwealth’s “irrevocable pledge” of its credit and taxing power to pay off the debt. It also stated that the bonds have a “first claim on available commonwealth resources” under Puerto Rico’s constitution. In January, the oversight board filed a motion seeking to invalidate more than $6 billion of GO bonds - the 2014 issue and bonds sold in 2012 - on the basis they were issued in violation of constitutional debt limits. Analysts said the litigation involving GO bonds could harm the municipal market and make it harder for the board to meet its mandate under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act to restore Puerto Rico’s capital markets access. “It will cast a dark cloud over any other full-faith general obligation credit in the future if they get away with it,” said Richard Ciccarone, the head of Merritt Research Services. Axios Advisors told clients: “Even if the board is successful in these efforts, which we seriously doubt, the commonwealth will be paying the price later on when it tries to access the capital markets again.” (Reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago, additional reporting by Luis Valentin Ortiz in San Juan Editing by Matthew Lewis)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

309,Wall St. climbs as jobs data supports upbeat economic outlook - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:35 AM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad-based rally on Friday as stronger-than-expected job growth in April coupled with muted wage gains left investors upbeat about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. The Nasdaq registered a record high close, while the S&P 500 ended just shy of a record high finish.     The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6 percent, the lowest level since December 1969. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. The data supports the Federal Reserve’s patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “That could portend for better earnings in the future for companies.” Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 197.16 points, or 0.75%, to 26,504.95, the S&P 500 gained 28.12 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.64, and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.22 points, or 1.58%, to 8,164.00. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% while the Dow slipped 0.2%. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around the S&P 500 earnings estimate for the first quarter to a rise of almost 1% compared with the 2% decline projected at the start of April.     Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 13.5% after the maker of Rubbermaid and other consumer goods exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled 10.4% after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.8% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.85-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 30 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.47 billion shares, compared to the 6.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel nearly two years ago, will also attend the news conference, the department said in a statement. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt,” said in a radio interview on Wednesday he may hold a news conference after Barr. Mueller on March 22 submitted to Barr a nearly 400-page report on his 22-month investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Moscow to sway the election in his favor, and whether Trump committed obstruction of justice with actions to impede the inquiry. In a letter to lawmakers two days later, Barr said Mueller did not find that members of Trump’s campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Russia. Barr also said he determined there was not enough evidence to establish that Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice, though Mueller did not exonerate Trump on obstruction.

McAuliffe had not been a factor in early public opinion polls for the 2020 race, which features the largest Democratic field in the modern political era, vying to challenge Republican President Donald Trump. Prior to serving his one term as governor, McAuliffe, 62, was largely viewed as a party kingpin and fund-raising dynamo who ran the Democratic National Committee in the early 2000s. In 2008, McAuliffe chaired Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, when she lost to Barack Obama in the party primary. While McAuliffe never held a White House position during Bill Clinton’s two terms as president, he was a close confidant of Clinton.

The Santa Clara County Superior Court in California awarded ASML $845 million along with an injunction, ASML said.  The Netherlands-based company said the judgment would be uncollectible as Xtal is in bankruptcy, but under a settlement arrangement ASML will end up owning most or all of Xtal’s intellectual property through the bankruptcy process. As part of the injunction, the court ordered Xtal not to conduct development activities on its software products that ASML says contain the Dutch company’s intellectual property. ASML said the injunction also bars Xtal from continuing to work in the same field of business as Brion, ASML’s computational lithography product, for a period of time. In April, ASML disclosed that former employees took company secrets to Xtal, which is funded by entities in South Korea and China and set up to sell a competing product to an existing ASML customer in South Korea.

319,Puerto Rico announces deal to restructure power authority debt - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  1:44 AM / in 4 days","4 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power utility struck a deal with a group of creditors that seeks to allow the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to restructure more than $8 billion of bonds, according to an announcement by government authorities on Friday. A group of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bondholders, bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, along with the island’s government and federally created financial oversight board, reached a restructuring support agreement that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32.5 percent. The move paves the way for a plan of adjustment for PREPA, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in July 2017 after a previous restructuring deal fell apart. The latest agreement, which requires support from at least 67 percent of voting bondholders to materialize, would shed about $3 billion in debt service payments over the next decade.  The deal also requires the approval of a U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, as well as legislative action. Under the agreement, investors will exchange their PREPA bonds at 67.5 cents on the dollar for new Tranche A bonds and 10 cents on the dollar for new Tranche B bonds. The latter would be contingent on full payment of Tranche A bonds and future electricity demand on the island. PREPA will pay off the new bonds through a special charge levied on its customers. The new charge starts at approximately 1 cent per kilowatt hour prior to the deal’s closing, increasing to some 2.768 cents per kilowatt hour upon closing and gradually increasing to approximately 4.552 cents per kilowatt hour during the expected 40-year lifespan of the bonds. The deal still lacks the support of other PREPA creditors, most notably bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. A spokesman for National declined to comment. National Public Finance filed an objection last month when a deal in principle was announced, saying that “until very recently” it was excluded from negotiations even though it is PREPA’s largest creditor. National has also asked the court to appoint a receiver for PREPA, support among other creditor remains unclear following Friday’s announcement. According to government and board officials, the privatization of PREPA is under way, with transmission and distribution contracts with private companies expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2020. “Now with this agreement we take a monumental step to provide for the restructuring of the debts and obligations of PREPA and finally conclude the bankruptcy process,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement. If approved in federal court, PREPA’s restructuring would mark the third major deal in Puerto Rico’s efforts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Deals involving the island’s sales tax-backed bonds and Government Development Bank have been approved by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain. PREPA’s financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September 2017, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.

320,Ride-hailing drivers in New York to strike ahead of Uber IPO - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:02 PM / 3 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in New York will go on strike next week shortly before the ride-hailing company goes public to protest what they view as unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said on Friday. The protests underscore the challenge for Uber of finding a way to lower driver costs in order to become profitable and paying drivers enough to retain their services.  Drivers for Uber, as well Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing apps, will strike on Wednesday for two hours, beginning at 7 a.m. ET (1100 GMT). Uber currently expects to price its IPO on Thursday and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day.  The drivers join peers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., who are also planning to strike. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said the drivers are demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares.  “Uber claims that we are independent contractors even though they set our rates and control our work day,” Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015, said in a statement.  “Uber executives are getting rich off of our work. They should treat us with respect. We are striking to send a message that drivers will keep rising up,” Lama said. Uber cautioned in its IPO filing that its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors. The company hopes to be valued at between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. Uber has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2019.  “I voted to go on strike because drivers need job security,” said Henry Rolands, an NYTWA member and Lyft driver.  Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lyft said in an emailed statement that its drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the last two year. “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs. On average, drivers nationwide earn over $20 per hour,” Lyft said. Reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

321,REFILE-Ride-hailing drivers in New York to strike ahead of Uber IPO - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:58 PM / in 4 days","2 Min Read(In 3rd paragraph, corrects time in GMT to 1100, not 1130) By Joshua Franklin NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in New York will go on strike next week shortly before the ride-hailing company goes public to protest what they view as unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said on Friday. The protests underscore the challenge for Uber of finding a way to lower driver costs in order to become profitable and paying drivers enough to retain their services. Drivers for Uber, as well Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing apps, will strike on Wednesday May 8 for two hours from 07:00 a.m. ET (1100 GMT). Uber currently expects to price its IPO on May 9 and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day. The drivers join peers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington DC who are also planning to strike. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said the drivers are demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares. “Uber claims that we are independent contractors even though they set our rates and control our work day,” Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015, said in a statement. “Uber executives are getting rich off of our work. They should treat us with respect. We are striking to send a message that drivers will keep rising up,” Lama said. Uber cautioned in its IPO filing that its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors. The company hopes to be valued at between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. Uber has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2019. “I voted to go on strike because drivers need job security,” said Henry Rolands, an NYTWA member and Lyft driver. Uber and Lyft did not immediately respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The 28-nation bloc has warned that it could re-launch a World Trade Organization case on the issue, while its “Blocking Statute” allows EU companies sued in the United States to recover any damages from U.S. claimants in EU courts.

324,Trump vetoes congressional resolution to end U.S. involvement in Yemen war - Reuters,"April 16, 2019 /  11:40 PM / 20 days ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has vetoed a congressional resolution that sought to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, the White House said on Tuesday. “This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future,” Trump said in the veto message. The resolution passed the House of Representatives in April and the Senate in March, marking the first time both chambers of Congress had supported a War Powers resolution, which limits the president’s ability to send troops into action. Neither the 247-175 tally in the Democratic-majority House nor the 54-46 vote in the Republican-led Senate would be enough to override the veto, which would require two-thirds majorities in both chambers. Backers of the measure said the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen had made the humanitarian crisis worse, harshly criticizing Riyadh for killing civilians. They also argued that U.S. involvement in Yemen violated the constitutional requirement that Congress, not the president, should determine when the country goes to war. The four-year-long civil war in Yemen, which pits the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels backed by Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire humanitarian crisis, with the country on the brink of famine.

325,Most Democratic presidential hopefuls still relying on large campaign donations - Reuters,"April 16, 2019 /  5:00 AM / in 20 days","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. Democrats emphasize building their 2020 presidential campaigns on grassroots support, fewer than half amassed at least 50 percent of their early financial backing from small-dollar donations, a Reuters analysis found. Candidates seeking the White House filed their first-quarter fundraising totals on Monday, revealing that many are still dependent on checks exceeding $200. Of the 15 Democrats who launched campaigns before April 1, only six amassed at least half their hauls from small-dollar donations. Many candidates are still leaning on donors in their home states for large checks. Nine Democratic candidates received the bulk of their contributions of $200 or more from their home states, the Reuters analysis found. Early fundraising prowess can signal the strength of a candidate’s campaign. Raising small checks from more donors can act as a test of popular support. Building a broad donor base that stretches beyond a candidate’s home state can be evidence of gaining traction. Many Democrats have touted their support among so-called “small-dollar” donors, those who give less than $200. But only six — U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders; U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren; former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard; and Andrew Yang, a former tech executive — are relying chiefly on those small-dollar donors.  The analysis includes fundraising reports covering the first three months of 2019 by the candidates who launched their campaigns prior to April 1. The field of candidates has since swelled, with 18 Democrats vying to win the party’s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in November 2020.  Sanders, of Vermont, benefited the most from small-dollar donors in the first quarter, with about 84 percent of his $18 million haul coming from individuals who contributed less than $200. Sanders also had the most geographic diversity in his donations, with California donors accounting for 27 percent of his donations of $200 or more. Less than 2 percent of his donations came from his home state. Warren - the only candidate to also swear off attending big ticket fundraisers - reported that about 70 percent of the $6 million she raised in the first quarter was from small-dollar donors. Massachusetts donors accounted for 25 percent of contributions over $200. Small-dollar donations can help catapult a candidate into the spotlight. Buttigieg until recently did not have a national profile, but raised $7 million during the first quarter of 2019 - of which 64 percent came from small donations. In a move to show they are serious about eliminating big money from politics, most Democratic presidential candidates have sworn off donations from corporate political fundraising committees. Some have nixed taking checks from registered lobbyists. The Democratic National Committee announced earlier this year that small-dollar, grassroots support will be one of the metrics it uses to determine who qualifies to participate in a series of nationally televised primary debates that will begin in June. Senator Kamala Harris had the second-largest Democratic fundraising haul, with 37 percent of her $12 million coming from small-dollar donors. O’Rourke reported that 59 percent of his $9.4 million was from donations of $200 or less. More than $2.1 million came from Texans who wrote checks of $200 or more. On the other end of the spectrum, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, raised only 10 percent of his donations in $200 or smaller contributions. There was also little geographic variation among his contributors, with more than 60 percent of donations over $200 coming from his home state. U.S. Senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, each raised about 16 percent of their cash from small-dollar donors. Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have sworn off corporate PAC money, but all raised heavily from people working in the technology industry. When looking by employer at their donors who contributed more than $200, all three raised more from Alphabet Inc Google employees than any other company. Sanders and Buttigieg raised more from people who were software developers or engineers than any other occupation.   Warren, who has called for breaking up big tech companies, also raised from employees working at Yelp. Donors to five candidates - O’Rourke, Warren, Harris, Gillibrand and Julian Castro, the former Housing chief - were more likely to be lawyers. Three candidates brought significant hauls from donors who listed their occupation as “homemaker” - Booker, Gillibrand and Gabbard.

326,RPT-Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:03 PM / in 4 days","2 Min Read(Repeats to attach to corrected alert, no change to content of story) By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview. “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the US economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said, adding that he would not view such a rate cut as taking out insurance against a possible bad outcome, as some analysts have suggested the Fed might do. Instead, he said, it would be a move that would build credibility and help the Fed fight future downturns. “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, despite an unemployment rate that has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent.

327,PRECIOUS-Gold eyes biggest daily gain in two months as dollar retreats - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:12 PM / in 4 days","3 Min Read* Gold down 0.5 pct so far this week * Platinum set for worst week in eight * SPDR gold holdings fall to lowest in nearly 7 months (Updates prices, adds fresh comments) By Brijesh Patel May 3 (Reuters) - Gold was headed for its biggest daily rise in two months on Friday, clawing away from a four-month low hit in the previous session, helped by a pullback in the dollar and as some investors covered their short positions. Spot gold rose 0.7% to $1,279.47 per ounce as of 2:22 p.m. EDT (1822 GMT), and was set for its biggest percentage gain since March 8. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% higher at $1,281.30 an ounce. The metal on Thursday dipped to $1,265.85, its lowest since the end of December. “We are seeing a short-covering rally after a sell-off during the week. We also saw some good physical demand at price levels below $1,270,” said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. “The dollar is weak, which is also helping gold,” he added. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report, the dollar was down 0.3%, as traders focused on the weaker aspects in the report. The U.S. wage gains did not accelerate as expected last month, holding at a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. A moderate pace of wage growth indicated that there would not be a rate hike anytime soon, in turn boosting appeal for the non-interest bearing metal, said an analyst based in New York. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the bullion. Despite the gains, gold is still on track to post a weekly decline of about 0.5% after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled little appetite to adjust interest rates in the near term. However, two Fed officials said on Friday they were increasingly worried about weak inflation, an indication that some U.S. central bankers see a growing case for a future interest rate cut even as others push for continued patience. Market participants were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a resolution to the year long tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the U.S.-China trade negotiations are going pretty well. Reflecting investor sentiment toward bullion, holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust, fell about 0.2% to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. Among other metals, silver rose 2.2% to $14.94 per ounce, after falling to a more than four-month low of $14.52 in the previous session. Platinum gained 2.6% to $869.75 per ounce, but has lost 3.3% for the week so far, its biggest weekly decline in eight. Palladium climbed 0.8% to $1,365.01 an ounce. (Reporting by Brijesh Patel and K.

328,MONEY MARKETS-U.S. fed funds rate slips after Fed's tweak on reserves - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:43 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read* Fed funds rate falls to lowest since mid-April * Fed funds/IOER, however, hit a record 6 bps on Thursday * Repo facility seen best to control fed funds rate - BAML (Adds background, quotes, graphic) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The rate U.S. banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight fell on Thursday a day after the Federal Reserve adjusted what it pays banks on reserves they leave with the U.S. central bank, New York Federal Reserve data released on Friday showed. The average or effective federal funds rate fell to 2.41%, the lowest since April 16, from 2.45% on Wednesday. The fed funds rate’s premium above the Fed’s interest on excess reserves (IOER), however, grew to a record-high 6 basis points from 5 basis points the day before. A number of factors have led to the stubborn upward drift in the fed funds rate, including reduced bank reserves linked to the Fed’s balance sheet normalization, increased government borrowing, and less willingness by big banks to lend reserves due to tougher capital standards in response to the global credit crisis. On Wednesday, the Fed shrank the gap between the IOER and the bottom end of its target rate on interest rates for a third time since last June in a bid to prevent the fed funds rate reaching the top of the range. It trimmed IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35%, while holding its target range at 2.25-2.50%. “The Fed got its intended results,” said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California. “The IOER cuts are technical in nature.” Still the Fed’s control of the fed funds rate is critical to bolster investors’ confidence in its effectiveness to conduct monetary policy. Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists Mark Cabana and Olivia Lima said on Friday the latest IOER move “is only a Band-Aid” to keep a lid on upward pressure on the fed funds rate. They suggested the central bank should introduce a standing repo program that would allow banks to exchange their Treasury holdings for short-term cash as the best means to control the fed funds rate.

329,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb after U.S. payrolls data tops views; dollar falls with inflation comments - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:28 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min Read* U.S. jobless rate falls to 49-year low * Global shares on track for sixth straight weekly gain * Dollar weakens after comments from Fed officials (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that blew past expectations, while the dollar weakened after several Federal Reserve officials voiced concerns about low inflation. U.S. job growth surged in April, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus recedes. Wall Street stocks rallied, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, putting both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on track for weekly gains. The strong jobs report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, when the Fed reiterated that it would remain patient on any changes in interest rates and indicated that no rate cuts were on tap for later this year, disappointing the expectations of some investors. “There was probably something in the report for everybody but to the extent the Fed wants to stay patient, they will focus most on that wage number,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “There is just not a lot of inflationary pressures that are out there.” U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 209.15 points, or 0.8%, to 26,516.94, the S&P 500 gained 27.94 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.46, and the Nasdaq Composite added 117.69 points, or 1.46%, to 8,154.46. European shares closed higher, helped by gains in Adidas and HSBC after strong quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.75%. The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects of the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, and following softer-than-expected data from an industry group on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low. New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that “raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates ‘lower for longer’ after periods of low inflation” can keep people’s expectations for prices at the right levels. The dollar index fell 0.31%, with the euro up 0.13% to $1.1191. Oil prices advanced but were still on pace for a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude rose 0.31% to $62.00 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.02, up 0.38% on the day. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.5305%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2-week high. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Dan Grebler and

The decision followed a request from Italy’s state railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, which is one of the companies who have said are willing to contribute to the rescue plan. The current deadline had expired at the end of April.  The government is arranging a rescue of the ailing company to avoid mass layoffs and has lined up Ferrovie dello Stato and U.S. carrier Delta as potential investors. But it still needs another investor to contribute to a bid that is estimated to be worth around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).

332,US STOCKS-Strong jobs report sets off broad-based rally on Wall Street - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  5:42 PM / in 4 days","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. April job additions rise solidly above estimates * All major S&P sectors trading higher * Amazon.com up as Berkshire Hathaway buys shares * Activision Blizzard falls on weak Q2 profit forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.72%, S&P 0.88%, Nasdaq 1.29% (Updates to early afternoon) By Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi   Sanyal May 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes rose in a broad-based rally on Friday, as job growth surged in April and unemployment rate dropped, pointing to solid expansion in the domestic economy. The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. “The labor market appears to be very strong and there is no inflation. It’s a great number for risk assets,” said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “In terms of Fed policymakers, they don’t have to do much at all.” Falling unemployment is expected to put an upward pressure on inflation and supported the Federal Reserve’s decision to be patient with interest rate hikes. However, St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard, who voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, said the central bank may need to cut rates if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter. Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.43%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. At 13:09 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 188.79 points, or 0.72%, at 26,496.58. The S&P 500 was up 25.68 points, or 0.88%, at 2,943.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 103.99 points, or 1.29%, at 8,140.76. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise compared with a 2% decline at the start of April. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 11.4% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled 13.8%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.2% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.77-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.19-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 26 new lows.

333,Some U.S. Fed officials are more worried by weak inflation - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:28 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadSTOCKHOLM/STANFORD, Calif. (Reuters) - Two Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday said they were increasingly worried about weak inflation, an indication that some U.S. central bankers see a growing case for a future interest rate cut even as others push for continued patience.  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, speaking at a conference in Stockholm, said this year’s drop in inflation excluding the impact of food and energy was worrisome. He said he was also concerned the economy might underperform. “Then policy may have to be left on hold - or perhaps even loosened,” Evans said in his speech. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard was even more emphatic about his concern about the softness in so-called core inflation, which rose only 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview.  “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this, but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the U.S. economy. It would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2 percent target,” Bullard said. The remarks by Evans and Bullard, who both have a vote on Fed policy this year, contrasted with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments to reporters after the release of the central bank’s latest policy statement on Wednesday. Powell repeatedly answered questions about the prospect of a rate cut by saying there was no strong case for moving rates in either direction. That sentiment was echoed on Friday by another senior policymaker, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida. He said the U.S. economy was in a “very good place,” with inflation expectations seemingly “stable,” and that the central bank had time to look at incoming data before deciding on any further interest rate changes. Data pointing to economic strength, highlighted by a jobs report on Friday that showed the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in nearly 50 years in April, and inflation that may be signaling underlying weakness is a conundrum for the Fed.  “Underlying inflation trends may be mired below 2 percent,” said Evans in Stockholm, noting that the Fed could some of the credibility that would be needed to fight future recessions if it can’t hit its inflation target. But he added that it was also possible inflation could surge and require rate hikes “over time.”  Bullard, in an earlier interview with CNBC, said the current level of inflation was making him a little nervous and that the Fed’s gradual three-year tightening cycle, which ended in December, might be constraining the economy despite signs of robust growth. “We’re a little tight,” Bullard said, referring to the federal funds rate, which the central bank uses to control borrowing costs. It is currently set in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.  The Fed is increasingly under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to ease monetary policy, a situation that has raised concerns about the central bank’s ability to maintain its independence. Trump, who has said recent rate hikes have undercut his efforts to boost economic growth, called on Tuesday for rates to be cut by a full percentage point. The top White House economic adviser on Friday said the central bank would likely move in that direction. “With these low inflation numbers, I think the Fed is actually looking at rate cuts,” White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network. “Our views right now intellectually are not really far apart from the Federal Reserve.” Kudlow has said the Fed is free to set policy as it sees fit, while Powell and other U.S. central bankers have insisted they operate independently from political pressure.

334,US middle market loan yields fall amid low dealflow - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  5:12 PM / in 4 days","6 Min ReadNEW YORK, May 3 (LPC) - Middle market institutional term loan yields fell in the second quarter of 2019, reversing six consecutive quarters of upward momentum, as investor demand continues to exceed a limited supply of deals. Average yields fell to 7.57% in the second quarter, from 8.06% in the first three months of the year, but are still higher than 6.66% in the second quarter of 2018, according to LPC data. The US middle market is seeing unprecedented demand as cash continues to flood into the sector from alternative lenders and private debt funds, who are competing with more established banks and institutional investors for limited dealflow, which is putting pressure on pricing. “Pricing is crunching down,” a middle market lender said. “There are deals, but not at the level we all want.” Excess demand is putting downward pressure on spreads and new issue prices, which together with Libor – the benchmark rate for floating-rate loans – make up the three components of leveraged loan yields. Falling Libor rates are also contributing to the drop in yields. Rising Libor rates previously helped to boost returns and offset the effect of tighter spreads, but the benchmark rate has been falling after peaking in December. Average middle market spreads have tightened to 463bp from 483bp in the first quarter, while the average issue price is now 99.03 versus 98.64 in the first quarter, LPC data show. “At the syndicated end of the middle market, where a lot of people are looking, the premium over large corporate deals has clearly diminished, which is one reason we don’t think investing in those deals makes sense,” said Tom Newberry, global head of direct lending at CVC Credit Partners. Investors expect a premium for middle market lending as the loans are less liquid and smaller companies are more vulnerable in an economic downturn due to higher customer concentration and less diversified revenue streams. Middle market loans offer a premium over broadly syndicated loans as a result, but this has shrunk to 70bp from 102bp a year ago, which is raising concern that investors are not being sufficiently rewarded for the additional risk. Rather investors can find additional yield in the smaller and more illiquid segments of the market. “Typically if you lend into illiquid situations you can still get 200-300bp of premium. That is a bit compressed relative to a year ago, but the spreads are still decent.” Newberry said. US institutional volume is picking up again after December’s volatility put a hole in the M&A machine and loan pipeline for early 2019. Dealflow is still limited, which is forcing investors to take what they can get and helping companies to achieve competitive pricing. In April, home maintenance and repair services provider Wrench Group raised a US$420m buyout loan, backing the company’s sale to Leonard Green & Partners. The funding included a US$45m revolving credit facility, a US$225m first-lien term loan, a US$75m first-lien delayed draw term loan and a US$75m eight-year second-lien facility. Jefferies was lead left on the first-lien portion of the transaction and was joined by Macquarie and Antares Capital, while Crescent Capital was lead arranger on the second-lien term loan. The first-lien term loan was well oversubscribed, according to a middle market investor. The spread cleared at 425bp, at the tight end of guidance of 425bp-450bp over Libor. Also in April, SERVPRO, a franchisor of property damage restoration services, was in market with a US$485m credit facility backing Blackstone’s acquisition of a majority stake in the business. The company raised a US$45m five-year revolver, a US$315m seven-year first-lien term loan and a US$125m eight-year privately placed second-lien term loan. During syndication, SERVPRO cut pricing on the first-lien tranche. The spread decreased to 350bp with a 0% floor, tight of guidance in the 375bp-400bp range. The discount also tightened to 99.75 from the 99.5 offered at launch. Pricing will step down by 25bp if the company issues an initial public offering. Jefferies, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank arranged the deal. Pricing pressure is to be expected in the current environment, where deals remain thin on the ground despite improving market technicals, market participants said. Although pricing is moving lower, loan spreads and all-in yields are still higher than a year ago, and look robust compared to red-hot conditions in 2017 and 2018, when repricing drove robust dealflow. Although cash continues to flow into the US middle market from direct lenders and private credit funds, 24 weeks of outflows from retail loan funds totaling US$26.2bn is tempering demand, as relative value investors see better opportunities elsewhere while further US interest rate rises remain on hold. If the situation reverses and US rates start to rise again, middle market pricing could come under renewed pressure as investors that buy loans for bigger companies chase yield in smaller middle market deals. This could be exacerbated by the return of opportunistic refinancing and repricing loans, after the recent reappearance of aggressive dividend recapitalisation loans, which allow private equity firms to extract money by releveraging portfolio companies with new debt.

335,Fed's Williams makes case for 'lower for longer' rates - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  5:03 PM / in 4 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve policymaker is making the case for changing how the Fed responds to periods of tepid inflation by keeping interest rates “lower for longer.” New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper here he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that ""raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates 'lower for longer' after periods of low inflation"" can keep people's expectations for prices at the right levels and reduce the negative effects of near-zero interest rates on the economy.  The research, which Williams will present at a conference at Stanford University in California on Friday, is geared toward a broad Fed policy review of how to get inflation to rise to and remain at its 2% target. That review may take many more months to complete. At the same time, Fed officials are discussing the more immediate issue of whether a rate cut might eventually be needed to keep prices rising at levels policymakers support. The White House has publicly called for the Fed to cut rates to support growth, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence renewing those calls on Friday. “There’s no inflation; the economy is roaring,” Pence said in an interview with CNBC. “This is exactly the time, not only to not raise interest rates, but we ought to consider cutting them.” The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the “core” personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, slowed to an annual rate of 1.6% in March. Some policymakers and analysts think the Fed is better equipped to respond to upward spikes in prices than to persistently low readings. That is because rate cuts lose their potency as borrowing costs approach zero. Any alternatives to the Fed’s current approach could be controversial. Williams’ paper develops an argument he has made before that people can start to expect central banks to miss their inflation target in periods where rates near zero, potentially hurting economic growth over time. But by aiming for inflation above the target during good times, policymakers eliminate weak inflation expectations and reduce the harm to the economy. Williams is vice-chairman and a permanent voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee. The issue is not strictly academic. The Fed now targets short-term rates from 2.25-2.50% and they could easily cut to near-zero again in response to the next recession.

336,Ex-Massachusetts governor challenges Trump in 2020 Republican presidential race - Reuters,"April 15, 2019 /  9:07 PM / 22 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld announced his candidacy on Monday to challenge President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination. Weld, 73, who served two terms as governor, from 1991-1997, enters as a long-shot candidate against an incumbent president who has remained popular within his party. Weld in February had said that he planned to challenge Trump. “I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we’ve had out of the White House the last two years that would be a political tragedy,” he said on CNN. “So I would be ashamed of myself if I didn’t raise my hand and run.” Weld’s challenge marks the first against Trump by a member of his own party. Other Republicans have publicly flirted with their own challenges, including former Ohio Governor John Kasich, one of the many Republican candidates whom Trump defeated for the party’s presidential nomination in 2016. But Republican leaders have signaled little tolerance for intra-party fights as Trump gears up for a potentially challenging bid for a second term.  “Any effort to challenge the president’s nomination is bound to go absolutely nowhere,” the Republican National Committee said in statement responding to Weld’s announcement, noting that its operation and the Republican Party are firmly behind Trump. Weld, a former prosecutor and the vice presidential candidate in 2016 on the Libertarian ticket, has been a consistent critic of Trump. He told CNN that he does not plan to mount an independent bid if unsuccessful.  Weld planned to kick off his campaign in New Hampshire, which holds an influential early nominating contest. He said the state’s voters would be receptive to his message and familiar with his record in neighboring Massachusetts. “Right now, all there really is coming out of Washington is divisiveness,” he said on CNN, calling both parties responsible but pointedly adding, “the grand master of that is the president himself.” Trump’s campaign raised more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2019, it said on Sunday, far outpacing the sums raised by individual Democratic candidates during that period. The fundraising underscores the willingness of Republican donors to invest in Trump’s re-election bid.

337,Redacted Mueller report to be issued by U.S. attorney general on Thursday - Reuters,"April 15, 2019 /  6:38 PM / in 22 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General William Barr plans on Thursday morning to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and contacts between Moscow and President Donald Trump’s campaign, the Justice Department said on Monday. Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not provide a precise time, but said the report, which Barr has described as nearly 400 pages long, will be released both to Congress and the public. Congressional Democrats have demanded the release of the full report with nothing blacked out and also have asked for the underlying evidence gathered by Mueller, meaning Thursday’s action by Barr may be just the first move in a longer fight that could play out in the courts. Moments after the department announced its plans for releasing the report, the Republican president went to Twitter to make another attack on Mueller’s team and derided the “Russia Hoax.” The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over the presidency of Trump, who has often called it a politically motivated “witch hunt.” Mueller turned over a copy of his confidential report to Barr on March 22, ending his 22-month-long inquiry. Two days later, Barr released a four-page letter summarizing what he said were Mueller’s primary conclusions. In that letter to Congress, Barr said Mueller’s investigation did not establish that members of Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russia.  Barr also wrote that Mueller presented evidence “on both sides” about whether Trump obstructed justice by acting to impede the inquiry, but he did not draw a conclusion one way or the other. Barr said that he reviewed Mueller’s evidence and made his own determination that Trump did not commit the crime of obstruction of justice. Justice Department regulations give Barr, a Trump appointee and the top U.S. law enforcement officer, broad authority to decide what to release and what to withhold from the report.  Barr has pledged to be as transparent as possible. But he has said he will redact certain portions for reasons including protecting secret grand jury information, intelligence-gathering sources and methods, information relating to ongoing cases and the privacy of “peripheral third parties” who were not charged. The redactions in the report will be colour-coded by category, according to Barr, explaining the reasons that parts are blacked out. After Barr released his four-page letter, Trump claimed “complete and total exoneration,” condemned “an illegal takedown that failed” and accused unnamed political enemies of treasonous acts. Since Barr released his letter, Trump has set his sights on the FBI, and accused the Justice Department of improperly targeting his campaign. Last week, Barr told a U.S. Senate panel he believed that “spying” did occur on Trump’s campaign, and he plans to investigate whether it was properly authorized. Barr’s comments were criticized by Democrats, already sceptical of how he has handled the report’s release. The attorney general has pledged to testify publicly about the report’s conclusions before the Senate and House judiciary committees - on May 1 and 2, respectively. The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee voted on April 3 to empower its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to issue subpoenas for the full report and underlying evidence. Meanwhile, the top Democrat and Republican on the House Intelligence Committee are also asking Barr to produce all of the investigative materials compiled by Mueller’s team and to make Mueller and his staff available for a briefing. In a March 27 letter seen by Reuters on Monday, Democratic Chairman Adam Schiff and top Republican Devin Nunes told Barr they want Mueller to brief them on “the investigation’s scope and areas of inquiry, its findings, and the intelligence and counterintelligence information gathered” in the investigation.

338,Democrats request documents on White House 'sanctuary city' idea - Reuters,"April 15, 2019 /  6:24 PM / 22 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday demanded documents from the Trump administration over a White House proposal to release migrants from detention and transport them to “sanctuary cities.” U.S. media reported on Thursday the administration had considered the idea, which would send migrants and asylum seekers who had crossed the U.S. border with Mexico to districts represented by Democratic lawmakers. The following day, Trump confirmed the proposal, saying in a tweet that he was strongly considering it. Sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that generally refuse to use their resources to help enforce federal immigration laws against undocumented immigrants that could lead to deportations. The localities say they do not have any responsibility to involve themselves in federal enforcement and doing so could impede policing efforts within communities. Since many of these jurisdictions are represented by Democrats, critics saw the plan as a way to taunt Democrats by dangling the possibility of an influx of illegal immigrants into their communities. In a letter addressed to the White House chief of staff and acting homeland security secretary, the heads of the House Judiciary, Oversight and Homeland Security panels - Representatives Jerry Nadler, Elijah Cummings and Bennie Thompson - called the idea “a bizarre and unlawful attempt to score political points.” “Not only does the Administration lack the legal authority to transfer detainees in this manner, it is shocking that the President and senior Administration officials are even considering manipulating release decisions for purely political reasons,” the three lawmakers wrote. They set a deadline for the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to send communications, documents and memoranda on the subject to the lawmakers by May 3. On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told ABC News the administration had initially concluded the proposal was too logistically challenging, but the White House was contemplating its options because the president liked the idea. The House has been controlled by a Democratic majority since January, but the Senate remains in the hands of Trump’s Republican Party.  Several immigration proposals, including some backed by the White House, failed to receive the necessary number of votes to pass Congress when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. U.S. officers arrested or denied entry to more than 103,000 people along the border with Mexico in March, an increase of more than a third over February and more than twice as many as in the same period last year.

339,World stocks rally after U.S. payrolls data tops views; inflation comments dent dollar - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:11 AM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that shot past expectations, while the dollar weakened after several Federal Reserve officials voiced concerns about low inflation.  U.S. job growth surged in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus recedes. Wall Street stocks rallied, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, giving both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq weekly gains.  The strong jobs report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, when the Fed reiterated that it would remain patient on any changes in interest rates and indicated that no rate cuts were on tap for later this year, disappointing the expectations of some investors. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “The Fed is going to pay attention more to inflation more than anything else. As long as inflation is below trend, that’s good.”  U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.55 points, or 0.75%, to 26,504.34, the S&P 500 gained 28.06 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.22 points, or 1.58%, to 8,164.00. For the week, the S&P gained 0.19%, the Dow slipped 0.15% and the Nasdaq gained 0.22%. European shares closed higher, helped by gains in Adidas and HSBC after strong quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.78%. MSCI’s index scored its sixth straight week of gains.  The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects of the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, and following softer-than-expected data from an industry group on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low.  New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that “raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates ‘lower for longer’ after periods of low inflation” can keep people’s expectations for prices at the right levels. The dollar index fell 0.36%, with the euro up 0.2% to $1.1198. Oil prices advanced but recorded a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude settled up 0.21% at $61.94 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.85, up 0.14%. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 2.5287%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2-week high.

First-quarter net income grew by 72.8 percent year-on-year to 41.9 million reais ($10.63 million), below a consensus estimate of 59.1 million reais compiled by Refinitiv, as higher expenses overshadowed revenue gains.     “Natura’s first-quarter results showed a reversal of the robust growth trend for the brand in Brazil, implying potential downside to our estimates,” analysts at Itaú BBA wrote in a report. Despite challenging conditions in key markets, notably Brazil, the company is still on track to deliver targets previously established and continue to deleverage, Natura’s chairman said. He emphasized the firm expects to reduce its net debt/EBITDA ratio to 1.4 by 2021 compared to 2.95 at the end of March this year.                                          Market participants have been closely following Natura’s leverage, as the company negotiates a deal with cosmetics maker Avon Products two years after acquiring The Body Shop brand from L’Oreal in a 1 billion-euro transaction. “At this point we have no further developments to report on our deal talks with Avon,” the chairman said.

343,PG&E unable to strike deal over renewable power contracts: court documents - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:13 PM / in 4 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - PG&E Corp was unable to reach a deal with NextEra Energy Inc and other companies with which it has billions of dollars in power contracts in a jurisdictional dispute over the bankrupt utility’s ability to walk away from or amend those agreements, according to court documents.     The matter will now be decided by the judge overseeing PG&E’s bankruptcy “in the coming weeks,” according to the documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday.     At issue is whether the bankruptcy court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over the power purchase contracts, which are worth up to $42 billion.     San Francisco-based PG&E wants the matter resolved in bankruptcy court, while NextEra and others want FERC involved. FERC has said it has “concurrent jurisdiction” with the bankruptcy court in such matters.     The contracts have emerged as one of the most contentious issues in PG&E’s bankruptcy, which the company launched in January in the face of tens of billions of dollars in potential liability stemming from wildfires in California in recent years that may be traced to its equipment.     The question of what will happen to the power contracts is critical for California’s goal to source 60% of its power from sources of renewable energy by 2030. Most of the power contracts in question are for solar or wind resources to fulfill the state mandate. “PG&E recognizes its important role in supporting the state’s commitment to clean energy initiatives and remains committed to continuing to help California achieve its bold clean energy goals,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the concerns from stakeholders across the state concerning the impact that Chapter 11 filing could have on the state’s clean energy progress. PG&E has made no decisions as to whether to assume or reject contracts as part of filing for Chapter 11.” Officials from NextEra were not immediately available for comment.Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali urged the companies and PG&E to try to reach an agreement by a May 3 deadline. In the court papers made public on Friday, they said they were unable to reach an agreement.

344,Fed 'insurance' rate cut not likely soon as economy hums along - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:29 PM / in 4 days","6 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was criticized by analysts and investors this week when he seemed to set aside concerns about weak U.S. inflation, repeatedly describing its recent decline as temporary and dimming market expectations of an interest rate cut. But in a series of statements and speeches since last fall, Powell, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and others have been consistent: The idea of preemptive “insurance” rate moves in either direction appear off the table for now, absent some unexpected event that raises new risks or shocks the economy into a higher or lower gear. Just as they no longer feel the need to get “ahead of the curve,” and raise rates in plenty of time to prevent inflation from rising too fast in the future, neither do they feel the current U.S. economy, with a 3.6 percent unemployment rate and growth above its long-term trend, needs an extra push and lower borrowing costs from the U.S. central bank.   Even after recent data showed core inflation, which excludes the impact of food and energy, at just 1.6 percent, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target, Clarida said on Friday the central bank remains “at or close to” its mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. More important, he regarded expectations about future inflation as “stable,” a sign he thinks inflation is less likely to slip further. “With the economy operating at or close to the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives ... we can, I believe, afford to be data-dependent” and watch the flow of information for signs of change or developing risks, Clarida said in a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Clarida’s remarks are one side of a sharp debate within the Fed about how to respond to an economy that is, on many levels, doing well, but also not behaving as expected. In particular, the current rate of unemployment, at a 50-year low, would be expected to lead to higher inflation as businesses bid up the price of labor, and workers bid up the price of goods.  It is an issue deeper than can be settled with a single rate cut. Indeed, the Fed’s view is that inflation is shaped largely by public and market psychology - with tight labor markets and resource constraints, and an array of those “transitory” factors cited by Powell pushing it narrowly around that underlying level. Rising productivity and other forces may be holding inflation back in a systematic way, allowing for even more growth without price pressures. That’s the argument White House officials have used to justify their demand for Fed rate cuts, and the idea has some traction at the central bank as well. But with the economy on an even keel and rates still relatively low, top officials like Clarida and Powell feel it better to wait for more compelling evidence - if only as a way to manage the risks of getting it wrong. Inflation is difficult to measure, with changes in statistical methods or one-off price swings in certain goods sometimes distorting the headline number in ways the Fed tries to look through. In similar language to Powell, former Fed chief Janet Yellen and her colleagues delayed expected rate increases for a year in 2016 as wobbling oil prices and other issues created their own set of “transitory” concerns.    In his press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, Powell referred to the weak inflation as transitory no fewer than nine times. That led some in the market to question the Fed chief’s assessment. Primed for a signal about rate cuts last week, stock and bond investors jumped in the opposite direction as Powell, in effect, restated that not much had changed since his last press conference in March. On Friday, Clarida cautioned against relying too heavily on the actions of “noisy” financial markets. He has previously warned about the risks of using economic models to try to look too far into the future, particularly at times like this when the Fed is near its targets, the economy is growing, and the costs of a mistake in either direction are higher.  There are arguments in the other direction. Echoing comments he has previously made, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday the central bank’s credibility and commitment to its inflation target may be at risk if it doesn’t respond at some point. Lost credibility may make monetary policy harder to conduct as time passes, he said. But even officials worried about low inflation, as well as the direction of bond and other financial markets, seem ready to wait for now. With nothing bad in the offing, there’s no need yet to buy “insurance,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday in an interview with Reuters. He added that the Fed’s decision in January to halt further rate increases was a “huge” change that might still lead to higher inflation as the economy adjusts to it. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018 and had, as late as December, anticipated more rises in borrowing costs this year.  Bullard said he would be ready to wait through the summer before considering a rate cut.   “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up, then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard said.

345,US STOCKS-Wall St rises as jobs report supports upbeat economic outlook - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:18 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. April job additions rise solidly above estimates * Amazon.com up as Berkshire Hathaway buys shares * Indexes up: Dow 0.8%, S&P 0.9%, Nasdaq 1.4% (Updates to late afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad-based rally on Friday as stronger-than-expected job growth in April with muted wage gains left investors upbeat about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. The data supports the Federal Reserve’s patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “As long as inflation is below trend, that’s good. So if you have the Fed in a box, you have strong labor force gains, that could portend for better earnings in the future for companies,” he said. Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.6 points, or 0.77%, to 26,510.39, the S&P 500 gained 26.62 points, or 0.91%, to 2,944.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 112.10 points, or 1.39%, to 8,148.87. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies reporting so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around the earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise compared with a 2% decline projected at the start of April. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc fell after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 28 new lows.

346,"Oil edges up after strong economic data, but ends week lower - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  1:46 AM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Friday as strong U.S. economic data boosted demand sentiment and as production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela tightened the market. Still, oil futures recorded weekly declines after a jump in U.S. crude inventories reported this week. Brent crude oil futures settled at $70.85 a barrel, rising 10 cents. The global benchmark shed 2.6% for the week, breaking a five-week winning streak.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures closed at $61.94 a barrel, up 13 cents, while losing about 3% percent during the week, its second straight weekly decline. A U.S. jobs report that showed growth surging in April and the unemployment rate dropping to a more than 49-year low of 3.6% increased expectations that crude demand would stay strong. “If more people are going to work, they’re going to have to drive or take transportation to get there,” Phil Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “It’s a good indication we could expect to see gasoline demand, oil demand picking up into the summer.” Equities rallied and the U.S. dollar weakened following the report, which also supported oil futures, Streible said. Oil prices tend to follow moves in equities, and demand for the U.S. dollar-linked commodity often increases when the greenback slips.  Gains in the oil market, however, were capped by Wednesday’s report that showed U.S. crude inventories jumping to their highest since September 2017 and production hitting a record 12.3 million barrels per day last week.. Exports of U.S. crude broke through 3 million bpd in November for the first time and peaked at 3.6 million bpd earlier this year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.     This week’s U.S. rig count, an indicator of future output, showed energy firms adding crude drilling rigs for the first time in three weeks, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production link: tmsnrt.rs/2VFPX81). U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, helped to tighten the market and support prices. Russia, part of OPEC+, is cutting oil output by as much as 10 percent for several days as its exports suffered from disruptions due to contamination of crude in a major pipeline to Europe and at a key port for shipments, industry sources said. Production from Saudi Arabia could edge higher in June to meet domestic demand for power generation, though output will remain within its quota in the supply pact, sources familiar with the kingdom’s policy said. The world’s top crude exporter is expected to produce about 10 million bpd in May, slightly higher than in April but still below its 10.3 million bpd quota under the OPEC-led deal, industry sources said.

Trump’s first-quarter haul, leaving his 2020 re-election effort with $40.8 million in cash, showed Republican donors were willing to invest in him as he girds for what is likely to be a difficult bid for a second term. Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have led the field of Democratic contenders in fundraising so far in 2019, raising $18.2 million and $12 million respectively in the first quarter. Sanders’ campaign said it received an average donation of $20 during the first quarter. The Trump campaign said its average donation during the same period was $34.26, and that nearly 99 percent of its donations were $200 or less.  The Republican National Committee brought in $45.8 million in the first quarter. Trump’s re-election campaign is raising money along aside the RNC in what is called a Trump Victory effort.

348,Trump may be trying to make everyone 'crazy' with sanctuary cities threat:  Sen. Rick Scott - Reuters,"April 14, 2019 /  3:40 PM / in 23 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may have threatened to transport illegal immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities to “make everybody crazy” and generate media attention, Republican U.S. Senator Rick Scott said on Sunday. Trump said on Friday he was considering sending illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities, prompting U.S. mayors to accept such an offer as the battle over border security rages.  Sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that generally give undocumented immigrants safe harbor by refusing to use their resources to help enforce federal immigration laws that could lead to deportations.  Since many such jurisdictions are Democratic strongholds, the proposal was seen by critics of Trump as an attempt by the president to punish Democrats for refusing to support funding for the construction of a wall on the southern U.S. border. It would, however, likely encounter a slew of logistical and legal obstacles, with some legal experts and advocacy groups saying the proposal could violate federal laws, including those barring the use of government funds for political purposes. Speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union,” Scott said he did not know if transporting immigrants to these jurisdictions was legal or illegal, and he suggested the president could be bluffing: “I mean maybe he’s just saying this to make everybody crazy, make everybody talk about it on their shows.” Scott, a former Florida governor who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November, has generally kept his distance from Trump and criticized him in the past over immigration policies and other issues. Frustrated by rising numbers of undocumented immigrants arriving at the southern border and a failure to get Congress to fully fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall, Trump has sought to taunt Democrats by dangling the possibility of an influx of illegal immigrants into their communities.  Scott acknowledged the president’s frustration over a lack of progress on addressing the influx of migrants, but said the administration had to comply with the law.  “I’m sure the president is very frustrated because we’re not securing our border, the Democrats are stopping this. But we have to comply with every law.” Late on Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter that the United States “has the absolute legal right” to transfer apprehended illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities, without citing evidence. “(T)his includes Gang Members, Drug Dealers, Human Traffickers, and Criminals of all shapes, sizes and kinds,” he wrote. On Sunday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told ABC News’ “This Week” that administration staff had initially concluded that transporting immigrants to sanctuary cities may prove too logistically challenging, but that the White House was exploring its options because “the president likes the idea.”  “We’re looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review,” Sanders said. Since Democrats have said they would welcome these individuals, “everybody gets a win out of it”, she added.

349,"Booker launches 'Justice' tour, aiming for surge in U.S. presidential bid - Reuters","April 13, 2019 /  10:15 AM / 24 days ago","4 Min ReadNEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Cory Booker held the first major rally of his presidential campaign on Saturday in the city that launched his political career, saying America “can’t wait” any longer to address the country’s deep divisions and urgent problems. The rally took place in Newark, New Jersey, Booker’s adopted hometown, where he built a national profile as mayor from 2006 to 2013 before winning a Senate seat. The event, which kicked off a two-week “Justice for All” multistate campaign tour, comes as Booker, 49, remains wedged in the middle of a crowded pack of Democratic hopefuls. Booker’s 30-minute speech relied on some of the same themes of unity and compassion that he has touted throughout his campaign, arguing that defeating U.S. President Donald Trump in 2020 will require an inclusive approach to combat the Republican chief executive’s often no-holds-barred brand of politics. “We have to decide whether we will choose division and blame - or if we will do the hard work of conquering fear with faith, apathy with action, and hatred with love,” Booker said. “The president wants a race to the gutter and to fight us in the gutter. To win, we have to fight from higher ground in order to bring this country to higher ground.” Booker also laid out a specific liberal policy vision, even as he warned that Democratic voters should favor pragmatism over ideological purity. He vowed to pursue Medicare-for-all, legalize marijuana, end mass incarceration and create “baby bonds” - government-backed savings accounts designed to close the racial wealth gap. The high-profile rally marked a shift for the Booker campaign, which thus far has emphasized more intimate events in key early voting states to introduce him to voters while building up staff on the ground. Booker has centered much of his campaign on his record in Newark, an economically troubled city that has nevertheless seen a revival during and after his tenure. But he has yet to see his campaign have the same sort of bounce that rivals such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California have enjoyed. Booker has stubbornly remained around sixth or seventh in opinion polls among the 18 Democrats who have entered the race. Campaign aides this week dismissed concerns about those numbers. “You’ve got to organize and got to get hot at the end,” Booker’s campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, told reporters on Thursday. “We’re not building this campaign to win polls in April 2019. This is a long race and there are going to be a lot of ups and downs.” Booker sought to connect his call to action on Saturday with the civil rights movement, noting that the date of the rally, April 13, was the same day that Martin Luther King Jr began writing his famous “Letter from Birmingham Jail” while sitting in an Alabama cell in 1963. “He spoke to the possibility of what we can achieve when we realize our own power and refuse to wait,” Booker said. “America, we know our history - it is a perpetual testimony to impatient, demanding, unrelenting people who in every generation with love stood up for justice.” Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Frank McGurty, Bill Berkrot and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Brent crude oil futures were at $70.71 a barrel at 1344 GMT, down 4 cents and set for their first weekly loss after five weeks of gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 2 cents at $61.83, poised for a second straight weekly decline. “Even with deep losses in supply from Iran and Venezuela, as well as a few other countries around the world, OPEC+ will still need to hold back production to balance the market,” SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note. The supply reflected output growth in the United States, he said. U.S. crude oil production reached a record 12.3 million barrels per day last week C-OUT-T-EIA, rising by about 2 million bpd over the past year. Exports of U.S. crude broke through 3 million bpd in November for the first time and hit a record 3.6 million bpd earlier this year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Rising U.S. oil production has helped to offset some of the disruption caused by U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+. Production from Saudi Arabia could edge higher in June to meet domestic demand for power generation, though output will remain within its quota in the supply pact, sources familiar with the kingdom’s policy said. The world’s top crude exporter is expected to produce about 10 million bpd in May, slightly higher than in April but still below its 10.3 million bpd quota under the OPEC-led deal, industry sources said. Traders said that prices were also put under pressure by Russia’s pumping clean oil through the Druzhba pipeline towards western Europe again, after several countries halted imports last week because of contamination. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are offering their domestic refiners about 8 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves after supplies from the Druzhba pipeline were halted, industry sources said on Friday. In the United States, analysts say supply will rise further as its export infrastructure is improved. “One of the things that we can see in the near future is the de-bottlenecking of the Permian basin in the U.S. through new pipelines and export capacity,” said Will Hobbs, chief investment officer for Barclays Investment Solutions. “This will connect the world’s largest shale basin to the global oil market.” Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore,

(Updates with dollar decline, closing prices) By Zandi Shabalala LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Copper rose on Friday on a weaker dollar and expectations for progress in U.S.-China trade talks, but the move higher was not enough to rescue prices from their worst week since November. A slide in the dollar boosted the appeal of most base metals which are priced in the U.S. currency, making them cheaper for holders of other currencies. “The (softer) dollar definitely seems to have improved sentiment in the commodities market,” said Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain. Investors also remained upbeat before U.S.-China trade talks next week that are widely expected to progress well following meetings in Beijing this week, analysts said. “The market would be very surprised if something doesn’t come out of trade talks over the next 2-4 weeks,” Bain said, adding that “if something didn’t happen I think you could see quite a sharp fall.” The tit-for-tat tariff dispute between the world’s top economies has cost both sides billions of dollars in exports, disrupted supply chains and roiled financial markets. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange ended 1.1 percent higher at $6,236 per tonne, rebounding from a two-and-a-half-month low touched the previous session. The metal used in the power industry and construction was down over 2.5 percent on the week, its biggest weekly loss since early November after computer-driven funds sold following an options expiry. DOLLAR: Traders focused on weaker spots in the U.S. jobs report, ignoring a jump in jobs growth and a 49-year-low in unemployment. At the same time, comments from two regional Federal Reserve chiefs supported bets the U.S. central bank might lower key lending rates by the end of the year. INVENTORIES: Copper stocks available to the market in LME-approved warehouses — on warrant stocks — dropped 5,750 tonnes to 164,375 tonnes MCUSTX-TOTAL. This is up from 21,600 tonnes at the end of February. TRADE TALKS: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that President Donald Trump was optimistic the United States could reach a deal on trade with China. ALUMINIUM: On warrant stocks of LME aluminium have jumped 36 percent over the last week and inched up a further 1,050 tonnes to 874,050 tonnes, LME data showed on Friday. MALSTX-TOTAL PRICES: Aluminium dipped 1.1 percent to $1,795.50 per tonne, zinc rose 1.5 percent to $2,772 after falling to a seven-week low in the previous session, lead gained 1.3 percent to $1,900, tin gained 0.3 percent to $19,325 while nickel was bid up 1.2 percent at $12,190.

352,Trump asylum policy gets temporary reprieve from Court of Appeals - Reuters,"April 12, 2019 /  5:00 PM / 25 days ago","3 Min ReadWILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The U.S. government can continue at least temporarily to send asylum seekers back to Mexico after President Donald Trump scored a rare ruling in his favor on Friday from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The asylum program was set to be shut down at 8 p.m. EDT (midnight GMT) by an order issued on Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg, but the Trump administration had asked for the Court of Appeals in San Francisco to intervene. The Court of Appeals issued a two-paragraph order saying the lower court injunction was temporarily stayed while the parties prepare to submit arguments next week on the government’s request for a longer stay that would remain in place for the months-long appeals process. The government told the Court of Appeals in papers filed late Thursday that the United States faced “a humanitarian and security crisis” at the southern border and needed to the policy to deal with surging number of refugees. Seeborg had ruled on Monday the policy was contrary to U.S. immigration law and ordered a nationwide injunction to halt the program, but delayed implementation of his order to allow the government to appeal. “This is an interim step while the court considers the government’s stay request,” said a statement from Judy Rabinovitz, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represented plaintiffs in the case and who opposed the stay. Since January, the administration has sent more than 1,000 asylum seekers, mostly from Central America, back to Mexico to wait the months or years it can take to process claims through an overloaded immigration system.  Although it is appealing and the lower court order had yet to take effect, Reuters reporters confirmed that the Trump administration was allowing some asylum seekers from Mexico to return to the United States. Trump has bristled at limits on his administration’s ability to detain asylum seekers while they fight deportation, and the administration was in the midst of expanding the program when Seeborg blocked it. The 9th Circuit Court has been a frequent target for Trump’s criticisms of the judicial system, which has blocked his immigration policies on numerous occasions. After Seeborg ruled on Monday, Trump tweeted: “A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants.

353,"U.S. mayors decry Trump sanctuary city threat, 'prepared to welcome' migrants - Reuters","April 12, 2019 /  7:17 PM / 25 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. mayors said on Friday their cities would welcome illegal immigrants, dismissing President Donald Trump’s threats to transport people detained at the border to “sanctuary cities” as illustrating the White House’s callous approach to the issue. Trump confirmed on Twitter that he wanted to transport people detained in his immigration crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border to sanctuary cities, an informal designation for localities that refrain from assisting federal immigration authorities in detaining people living in the country illegally. Mayors from across the country were quick to respond to Trump’s latest portrayal of immigrants and sanctuary cities as threats. In New York City, where nearly 40 percent of the population are immigrants, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Trump’s immigration policy was rooted in cruelty. “He uses people like pawns,” de Blasio said in a statement. “New York City will always be the ultimate city of immigrants – the President’s empty threats won’t change that.” In Philadelphia, known as the city of brotherly love, Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement that his city “would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades.” He said the White House was demonstrating “the utter contempt that the Trump Administration has for basic human dignity.” The Republican president has made cracking down on illegal and legal immigration a centerpiece of his administration, and has regularly threatened to try to cut federal funding to programs in generally Democratic-leaning sanctuary cities, counties and states. “Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only,” Trump wrote on Twitter, confirming a Washington Post report.  The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, responded by saying on Twitter: “These are people, not pawns, Mr. President.” At least one governor, New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham, weighed in, calling the plan “absurd, sad and all too characteristic of the president — not to mention indicative of a complete and cruel indifference to the plight of migrant families.” The mayors of Oakland, California, and Takoma Park, Maryland, voiced similar reactions. Trump’s latest move on immigration comes days after U.S. officials said they arrested or denied entry to over 103,000 people along the border with Mexico in March, more than twice as many as the same period last year. “I am shocked but not surprised that once again this president is playing a cynical game with people’s lives in order to score political points,” Jesse Arreguin, the mayor of Berkeley, California, said in a statement. “Rather than supporting a real pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in this country, he is fanning the flames of division.” Reporting by Jonathan Allen; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

354,"U.S. Senator Warner eyes social media bills for hate speech, data portability - Reuters","April 11, 2019 /  10:38 PM / in 25 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Mark Warner, who co-sponsored legislation this week to ban deceptive practices by social media companies, said on Thursday he was eyeing additional bills aimed at limiting hate speech and allowing users to move their data across platforms.  The Democratic lawmaker said he would offer more bills in the next month or two, ideally with Republican colleagues as a co-sponsor.  The additional legislation could focus on hate speech, data portability, which gives social media users the ability to easily take their data to another site, and transparency about who or what is on the other side of an internet conversation, Warner said in an interview with Reuters. On Tuesday, Warner joined with Republican Senator Deb Fischer to introduce a bill to bar online platforms like Facebook Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google from misleading people into giving personal data to companies, or otherwise tricking them. It would also ban online platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users from designing addicting games or other websites for children under age 13.         Warner is eager to increase transparency on social media platforms.   “Shouldn’t we have the right to know whether we’re being contacted by a human being versus a bot when you’re on social media?” he said. Issues of engagement and data collection are key for social media companies since they use information gathered about users to sell advertisements, a key source of profit. Warner noted the real-life implications of hate speech on social media, pointing to mass killings in New Zealand and Pittsburgh. In a massacre in New Zealand, a gunman opened fire in two mosques on March 15, killing 50 people as he broadcast the attack live on Facebook. Last year, 11 people were shot to death in a Pittsburgh synagogue. The man accused in the killings had made aggressive anti-Semitic comments in online forums. Some of the proposed legislation could be rolled into a federal privacy bill being drafted in Congress. That bill was prompted by California’s data privacy law that imposes fines of up to $7,500 on large companies for intentional failure to disclose data collection or delete user data on request, or for selling others’ data without permission. It takes effect next year. “I want technology to stay. I want the social media platforms to stay,” Warner said. “But I do think the days of the Wild Wild West where anything goes, people just aren’t going to allow it.” Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

355,Icahn discloses U.S. probe into sale of Manitowoc shares: filing - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:38 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadBOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s company for information about trades in crane maker Manitowoc, Icahn Enterprises disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, in its first acknowledgement of such a probe. Icahn Enterprises said it received a subpoena after critics questioned the timing of Manitowoc stock sales Icahn, who briefly served as an unpaid adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, made before his administration announced steep steel tariffs in March 2018. Questions had swirled about whether the sales were prompted by inside information about Trump’s plans. The stocks of many U.S. industrial companies, major consumers of steel, fell that day after the announcement, with Manitowoc losing more than 6%. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York contacted Icahn Enterprises in June 2018, the company said in the filing. “We cooperated with the request and provided documents in response to the subpoena.” The U.S. Attorney’s office and Icahn’s office had no immediate comment. Manitowoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors in Manhattan have a history of pursuing major cases over insider trading on Wall Street, famously securing the trial conviction of hedge manager Raj Rajaratnam and a guilty plea from the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Icahn sold roughly one-third of his stake in Manitowoc, which uses steel to make its equipment, between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, 2018. Trump said on March 1 that he would impose 15% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminum to make domestic production more attractive. In response to news reports about his stock sales, Icahn said he cut his position in Manitowoc for “legitimate investment reasons” and dismissed any speculation that his sale of shares was prompted by knowledge about Trump’s plans. Icahn, who has been friendly with Trump for decades, has been a sounding board for Trump and was instrumental in vetting people for key positions before Trump was inaugurated in 2017. He stepped down as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in August 2017. Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Nate Raymond; Editing by Richard ChangAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

356,"European shares rise on strong results, upbeat U.S. jobs data - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  7:57 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, recovering from their worst day in six weeks with support from robust jobs data from the United States and strong results from Adidas and HSBC.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.4 percent, rising up to 0.6 percent after strong U.S. jobs data, before trading back at mid-day levels. On the week, the index fell 0.2 percent after two week of gains.   Data on Friday showed that U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity.[MKTS/GLOB] “The April (jobs) report allows the U.S. Federal Reserve to remain comfortably on hold for the next few meetings as it awaits more data, particularly on global risks and the inflation outlook,” said analysts at TD Securities in a note. Investors tend to dump stocks in a rising interest rate environment due to higher cost of capital and better appeal for bonds.  Shares around the globe had fallen on Thursday after the Fed signaled little appetite to adjust interest rates anytime soon, dampening hopes of a rate cut among market participants.  Gains of nearly 2 percent by London-listed shares of HSBC Holdings after the lender beat quarterly profit estimates, was the biggest boost to the pan-region index. French lender Societe Generale also rose as its capital buffer was stronger than expected, helping investors shrug off a decline in quarterly net profit. The personal and household goods sector rose 1.2 percent. Adidas jumped almost 10 percent to hit a record high after the sportswear maker’s quarterly net profit rose. “Not many European stocks are racking up all-time highs, and that underlines the bullish sentiment,” said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets, London. Basic resources stocks gained 1.4 percent as copper prices rebounded.  Fiat Chrysler jumped 4.6 percent after the carmaker said new U.S. pickup truck models would help the automaker achieve its 2019 profit targets and offset a weak first quarter. Meanwhile, Air France-KLM tumbled 5.5 percent as the Franco-Dutch group blamed higher fuel costs and tough price competition for its first-quarter loss. Reinsurer Swiss Re AG slid 3 percent to be one of the biggest drags on STOXX 600 on an unexpected fall in quarterly net profit. A more than 7 percent fall by German telecoms group Freenet was the worst on the broader index after UBS downgraded the stock’s rating to ‘sell’.

357,Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:44 PM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadPALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday.  “I certainly would be open to a cut,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a monetary policy conference at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year.  “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview.  “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the U.S. economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said.  In his view, he said, such a rate cut would not be insurance against a possible bad outcome, but rather a bid to boost Fed credibility along with inflation, and position the Fed to better fight future downturns.  “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said.  Still, he said, though the Fed’s policy stance is currently a “little bit tight,” cutting rates now would risk overdoing it on policy easing. The Fed’s January shift has helped push down Treasury yields, he said. And though it has not yet had an obvious effect on inflation, which by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, it might.   “You won’t know that until the July, August timeframe,” he said. Meanwhile unemployment has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent, a strong showing for the labor market that economists would normally expect to put upward pressure on inflation.

358,US STOCKS-Wall Street bounces on robust job additions in April - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:02 PM / in 4 days","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. job additions rise solidly above estimates * All major S&P sectors trading higher * Amazon.com up as Berkshire Hathaway buys shares * Activision Blizzard falls on weak Q2 profit forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.47%, S&P 0.68%, Nasdaq 1.13% (Updates prices, adds details) By Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi   Sanyal May 3 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes rose steadily on Friday, as a stronger-than-expected job growth in April showed that the U.S. economy continues to expand. The Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, pointing to muted inflationary pressure. “The economy is looking fairly strong and inflation pressures are subdued, which is bullish for the stock market,” said Rahul Shah, chief executive at Ideal Asset Management in New York. “Risk sentiment is likely to be on because the Fed is likely to remain on hold because you would need to see a string of higher job numbers at this level for the Fed to consider raising rates.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on Wednesday that decline in inflation was likely due to transient factors dampened hopes of an interest rate cut this year, pushing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq off their record highs. All three major indexes were set to end the week lower, with the Nasdaq on course for its first weekly decline in five. At 11:31 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 122.47 points, or 0.47%, at 26,430.26, the S&P 500 was up 19.93 points, or 0.68%, at 2,937.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 90.98 points, or 1.13%, at 8,127.75. Also helping gains was a largely positive earnings season. Of the nearly 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise from a 2% decline at the start of April. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with a 1.23% rise in consumer discretionary stocks powering the gains. Amazon.com Inc rose 2.9%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 10.6% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc plunged 15%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 6.4% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.24-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 24 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 61 new highs and 23 new lows.

359,"UPDATE 1-Revamped Euribor, Eonia set to win regulatory approval by year-end - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  3:59 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(Adds detail, background) By Marc Jones and Huw Jones LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Revamped versions of the Euribor and Eonia interest rate benchmarks are set to get the regulatory green light by the end of the year, helping the euro zone catch up with reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the global rate-rigging scandals. Jean-Louis Schirmann, the Secretary General of the Brussels-based administrator of Euribor and Eonia, told Reuters it had applied for approval with the Belgian financial markets regulator FSMA and hoped for clearance in the coming months. “We can confirm that this is EMMI’s (European Money Markets Institute) intention,” Schirmann said on Friday. FSMA confirmed the application, telling Reuters it expects to be able to grant EMMI approval for Euribor this summer, with both “compliant” with new EU benchmark rules by the end of the year. Eonia and Euribor are two of the main euro-denominated measures of money market lending rates and are widely used as a reference for pricing home loans, credit cards and other products. Banks in Europe and the United States were fined billions of dollars over the last decade for trying to rig Euribor and its larger cousin, the London Interbank Overnight Rate or Libor. EMMI’s application comes despite a recent decision by the European Commission to give ‘critical’ benchmarks like Euribor and Eonia an two extra years to end of 2021 to comply with new rules. Central banks are publishing their own “risk-free” rates as an alternative to Libor and its variants. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are already publishing their rates, but the European Central Bank is not due to start publishing its “Ester” rate until later this year. “The euro area is lagging, with the ECB launch of risk-free benchmark rate Ester slated for October 2019, while Euribor will likely be alive longer than other Libor rates,” JPMorgan said. This means the euro area will likely have a “hybrid” system for a while, meaning reformed rates and the new “risk-free” rate will sit side-by-side. This contrasts with Britain, where regulators want the BoE’s rate to replace Libor by the end of 2021. Formal approval for a revamped Euribor would also take pressure off industry to come up with a “fallback” for use if it was being discontinued.

360,UPDATE 2-Spain/German yield gap at tightest in nine months as periphery shines - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:37 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read* Italy set for biggest weekly fall in yields in 6 wks * Spain 10-year bond yield close to lowest since 2016 * EZ flash CPI, US NFP due out * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Spain’s 10-year bond yield gap over safer Germany was at its tightest in almost nine months on Friday, while Italian borrowing costs were set for their biggest weekly fall in six weeks in a sign of improved sentiment towards the periphery. Bond yields in the likes of Germany, France and the Netherlands edged higher as data showed a rise in euro area inflation and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann expressed scepticism about a proposal to grant banks some relief from negative central bank interest rates. But as the week draws to a close, it was the move in southern European bonds that stood out. Relief that S&P Global kept Italy’s ratings unchanged last Friday and Sunday’s election in Spain passed without any major upsets, sparked a fall in bonds yields and rise in prices at the start of the week. That move gathered pace as data lifted hopes of a recovery for regional economies: the Spanish manufacturing sector for instance expanded in April at its fastest rate since January, data showed on Thursday. “Near-term, this dynamic (in the periphery) looks set to extend,” said Christoph Rieger, head of rates at Commerzbank. “This week’s GDP data was better than expected and PMIs show improvements in the periphery while Germany has faltered.” Spain’s 10-year bond yield hovered near its lowest since late 2016, a level hit on Thursday at around 0.97 percent . As benchmark German bond yields inched up to 0.04 percent , the Spanish/German 10-year bond yield narrowed to around 94 bps - its tightest in almost nine months , before closing the day at around 99 bps. Italy’s 10-year bond yield was marginally higher at 2.56 percent, near over two-week lows hit the previous day. James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, said he was bullish on Spain long-term and started selling German Bunds last week. “In Europe, we’re long Spain versus Germany and France,” he said. “With that you get the best-performing economy of the majors in the euro zone and we’re past the event risk of the election.” Other analysts noted big flows into peripheral bonds this week, which they suspected was cross-asset investors shifting funds from equity to fixed income markets. Data showed euro zone inflation accelerated to 1.7 percent in April from 1.4 percent a month ago, beating expectations. German bond yields rose ahead of the data, with an inflation rise anticipated after strong German numbers earlier this week, before easing back slightly. “I wouldn’t get too excited about the inflation numbers as they reflect the timing of Easter and they should slip back,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.

361,Sterling surges to a 1-month high on Brexit deal hopes - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:13 AM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Sterling surged past $1.3150 on Friday after the leader of Britain’s opposition party said parliament must break the deadlock over Brexit and “get a deal done” to exit the European Union. It also rallied to a one-month high against the euro as broad dollar weakness prompted investors to cut short positions heading into a long weekend with Britain shut for a local holiday on Monday. Lee Hardman, MUFG’s currency analyst based in London said “optimism” over a “cross-party deal to break the impasse” had extended the move higher in sterling.  Traders heading into a three-day weekend in London may also be trimming any short positions in the pound in case they are caught out by positive news in the Brexit talks when markets are closed. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, said on Friday that the results of local elections held around the country the previous day should spur lawmakers to find a way to “get a deal done” to leave the EU. He was quoted by ITV as saying there was now a “huge impetus” on every lawmaker to deliver a deal. Against the dollar, the pound surged more than a percent to $1.3175, a one-month high.  Against the euro, the pound surged 0.9 percent to 84.98 pence, a new one-month high. Investors have been broadly impervious to tepid economic data this week and relatively hawkish comments from the Bank of England at a policy meeting on Thursday. The BoE said on Thursday that markets should expect interest rates to rise more in the next few years than they currently assume, if the economy grows as policymakers expect and inflation is brought back to target. Trading in the pound has become far less volatile as investors sit on the sidelines while British politicians try to find a way out of a deadlock over Brexit. Britain will not leave the EU until possibly the end of October after London and Brussels agreed a delay. But Friday’s moves underscored how sensitive markets remain to the prospect of any deal.  “Hopefully, both the political parties draw their conclusions after yesterday,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London, referring to the local elections. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives and the Labour Party were both punished by voters, who blame them for the deadlock over Brexit, partial results showed.

364,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb, dollar dips in wake of U.S. payrolls report - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  3:27 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min Read* U.S. payrolls surge past expectations * Global shares on track for first weekly fall in six * Dollar weakens after comments from Fed officials (Updates with open of U.S. markets, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets climbed on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that blew past expectations, while the dollar weakened after comments on inflation from some Federal Reserve officials. U.S. job growth surged in April, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus fades. The payrolls report lifted stocks on Wall Street, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, although each was still poised to post a weekly decline. The strong report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday in which some investors were anticipating the central bank to ease interest rates and recent calls from the Trump administration for a rate cut. “Hard to find fault. From the economy point of view, this is very, very solid,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “It supports a little bit of what Powell said that those who were hoping for him to talk about a rate cut, employment is certainly continuing at an amazing pace.” U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.34 points, or 0.45%, to 26,425.13, the S&P 500 gained 20.42 points, or 0.70%, to 2,937.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.61 points, or 1.19%, to 8,132.39. European shares advanced, lifted in part by gains in Adidas after its quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.44% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.60%. Despite the strong jobs data, the dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects in the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, following a softer-than-expected report on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Fed’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low. The dollar index fell 0.33%, with the euro up 0.18% to $1.1196. Oil prices advanced but were still on pace for a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude rose 0.97% to $62.41 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.35, up 0.85% on the day. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.5214%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2 week high.

365,SoftBank picking its battles with U.S. national security committee - Reuters,"April 12, 2019 /  3:13 AM / in 25 days","5 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp has agreed to give up board seats and access to sensitive information, take a more passive role in startups and make other concessions to get government clearance for its technology deals in the United States. These maneuvers come as the Japanese investor confronts a new U.S. law aimed at cracking down on foreign investors. SoftBank’s investment style has made it a frequent visitor of a U.S. government group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), charged with reviewing foreign investment for national security and competitive risks. “We know the deals are going to be reviewed,” Marcelo Claure, chief operating officer of SoftBank Group Corp, said in an interview with Reuters this week. “We have abided by what the U.S. government wants.” SoftBank likes to take large stakes in companies working on artificial intelligence, data analytics, financial services and self-driving cars - technologies increasingly viewed as critical to national security. This puts them in the crosshairs of a law signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last year expanding the powers of CFIUS. Giving up board seats and access to private information would make SoftBank less of a threat in the eyes of CFIUS, giving its deals a better chance of approval. “We would not accept this if we were in the business of running companies,” Claure said of the concessions. “We’re not. We are in the business of investing.”      Claure declined to provide specifics on investments where SoftBank has had to make concessions or give up board seats and the U.S. government does not comment on CFIUS reviews.  The regulations have deterred many foreign investors from even attempting investment in U.S. tech companies. “Everything is a conversation with the government so you figure you are going to pick your battles,” Claure said. One regulatory battle SoftBank has chosen, so far, to sit out is regarding Uber Technologies Inc’s board seats. As part of an $8 billion investment SoftBank closed in January 2018, which gave it a 16 percent stake in Uber and made it the largest shareholder, SoftBank was supposed to get two board seats. SoftBank successfully completed its investment in Uber, but has not yet completed the formal CFIUS review necessary for the two board seats, Claure told Reuters. As a result, more than a year later, Claure and Rajeev Misra, who oversees SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, have not taken their board seats. The result is that Uber on Thursday kicked off its initial public offering with a board of 12 directors, not the 17 members long ago agreed upon. Another three independent directors cannot be appointed until after Misra and Claure join the board.    By the time Uber’s shares start trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, SoftBank may have missed its opening. When it becomes public, Uber’s bylaws will change, erasing old agreements with its directors, according to Uber’s IPO filing posted Thursday. Claure said SoftBank may still follow through with seeking CFIUS approval, but added that “it hasn’t been a priority for us” and SoftBank still has the access it wants to Uber’s executives without the board seats. After becoming chief operating officer in May of 2018, Claure increased SoftBank’s presence and lobbying power in Washington. “The first job was to change the conversation with the U.S. government and explain to the U.S. government what is SoftBank,” Claure said. It hired former Ford Motor Co lobbyist Ziad Ojakli to improve relations with regulators. SoftBank added a former White House staffer and a Department of Commerce deputy to its Washington staff last fall, and hired Jeffrey Dressler, previously a national security adviser to members of the U.S. Congress, as its national security policy director in January. Even without board seats or more control in a company, SoftBank still wields a lot of influence. SoftBank at times requires companies to meet performance goals before receiving money and generally prohibits founders and employees from selling their company shares.     SoftBank last month unveiled a $5 billion fund to invest in technology companies in Latin America, where it will be well outside of CFIUS’ control. Claure said SoftBank has already looked at more than 140 companies for possible investment and closed a few deals. But Claure said SoftBank is not retreating from CFIUS. “We will find ways to invest in the United States,” Claure said.

366,White House's Kudlow supports Fed's Powell and Cain nomination - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  1:56 PM / in 25 days","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday he has confidence in Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell but that President Donald Trump intends to proceed with plans to name a controversial partisan to the U.S. central bank’s board of governors. Kudlow said at an event sponsored by The Hill the White House is sticking by Herman Cain as a candidate for a Fed seat “at the moment,” even after several Republican senators came out against the idea and despite allegations of misconduct against the former pizza company chief executive. Kudlow noted that Cain was being vetted. “He is in the process. We’ll let him go through it. And the president insists on that,” Kudlow said. Trump had reiterated his support for Cain as late as Wednesday night, he said. Controversy over Cain’s possible nomination, as well as that of economic commentator and Trump supporter Stephen Moore, continued on Thursday. Senator Kevin Cramer became the fourth Republican senator reported to oppose Cain’s expected nomination, potentially putting his chances in peril. Elected officials and interest groups on both sides of the political aisle voiced support for Powell, and for the need to keep the Fed at arms length from the influence of politicians in its interest rate decisions. “The chairman of the Fed is the leader in the world of central banks. Now, thank God, Chairman Powell is there, but for him to have to deal with a politically motivated Fed - this is a really dangerous one,” House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Powell briefed House Democrats in a closed-door session at their annual retreat on Thursday evening but declined to comment on Trump’s candidates for the Fed, lawmakers said afterwards. “He said he didn’t comment on appointments,” Representative Donna Shalala said. Representative Ami Bera said Powell talked about the domestic and global economy. “The Fed will continually watch what’s happening, but things like Brexit and trade uncertainty obviously are things that they are paying attention to,” Bera said. Representative Brad Sherman said Powell emphasized the Fed’s independence and also talked about how U.S. debt and deficits are unsustainable in the long term. “When Powell was first appointed, he might have gotten a chilly reception from our caucus” because he was elevated to Fed chair by Trump, Sherman said. “But it’s obvious now that Trump doesn’t like Powell and is trying to appoint people to Powell’s board that are the cultural antithesis to Powell. Because Powell is disliked by Trump, we like him a lot more,” he said. The issue was also percolating through the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, institutions whose largest shareholder is the United States. The country has been looked on to serve as a sort of global touchstone on issues such as the importance of leaving politics out of interest rate decisions. “How do you see the Fed’s independence, given what appears to be political persuasion trying to guide policy from outside the building?” Institute of International Finance President Tim Adams asked Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, an apparent reference to recent demands by Trump that the Fed lower interest rates. “We are accountable to the Congress,” Clarida said in an answer that skirted mention of Trump. “The Fed is a creation of the U.S. Congress by statute. We have a very clear in black-and-white mandate assigned to us ... which is maximum employment and price stability,” not maximizing the growth rate of gross domestic product, he said. Central bank “capture” by national leaders has been blamed for a variety of economic ills, from hyperinflation to runaway debt used to finance projects in hopes of winning reelection. Moore has said recently he wanted to accommodate Trump’s policies, that he feels the president’s reelection was necessary for the country’s economic success, and wants to do battle with what he calls “growth-phobiacs” at the Fed. The president nominates members to the Fed’s seven-member board of governors and Trump elevated Powell to chairman a year ago. The nominations must be approved by the Senate. Another 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, head regional banks and are chosen by local boards of directors, not the president. Trump and Kudlow have both been critics of the Fed’s policies under Powell. Kudlow reiterated on Thursday that he disagreed with the Fed’s most recent interest rate hikes.     “He’s a fine person,” Kudlow said of Powell. “I think he’s going to turn into a good Fed chairman.” Kudlow noted the Fed was independent but said that would not stop him and others from weighing in on its activities. “The Fed is an independent central bank and we aim to keep it that way,” Kudlow said. “That doesn’t mean we can’t express our opinions periodically.” Asked about the controversy over the usually staid Fed, including statements by Cain and Moore in mainstream and social media, St. Louis Federal Reserve bank President James Bullard said the institution tends to “convert” people pretty quickly to its technocratic methods. Moore, for example, said in a Bloomberg interview that he felt Fed meetings should be televised - a likely non-starter for an organization that publishes minutes of its meetings three weeks after the fact and holds regular news conferences but feels a camera in the room would inhibit free discussion.

367,U.S. to send 100 agents to Mexico border to cut delays: congresswoman - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  8:23 PM / in 25 days","2 Min ReadEL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will send about 100 agents to the Mexico border to speed up crossing times, a U.S. congresswoman said on Thursday, as businesses grapple with trade delays after officers were redeployed to immigration duties. The slowdowns began late last month after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to close the border if Mexico did not halt a surge of people seeking asylum in the United States. The administration moved several hundred border agents to handle the influx of migrants, triggering long delays for cross-border traffic because of the staffing shortage. As soon as Monday, CBP plans to send officers from the Canadian border and other parts of the country to El Paso, Texas, said Democratic U.S. Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas, noting she had been informed by CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez. CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Rio Grande Valley, on the eastern edge of the border, was being considered as another point to deploy extra officers, Escobar added. Wait times totaling hours have hit industrial trade hard.  Losses have amounted to $800,000 a day for transportation businesses in Mexico’s Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso, said the head of Mexican trucking association CANACAR, Manuel Sotelo. Data from border business association Index Juarez showed that losses from 28 exporting firms in Ciudad Juarez that utilize the crossing total $15 million over the past week. In El Paso, several truckers said they usually did four crossings a day and were now managing only one. Some manufacturing plants, including automotive factories that depend on constant cross-border shipments, have turned to expensive air freight to stay on schedule.  Passenger vehicles that would normally wait up to an hour and a half to cross are now facing four-hour waits.

368,Indonesian 'Belt and Road' high-speed rail link expects $18 billion from satellite towns - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:02 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read (The April 30 story corrects Economic to Economist in paragraph 8 and Yusuf to Jusuf in paragraph 12) By Cindy Silviana and Fanny Potkin JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian-Chinese consortium building a high-speed rail link between the capital Jakarta and the textiles hub of Bandung expects to earn $18 billion developing satellite towns and industrial centers along the line, a company official said. The rail project, part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond was described last month by China’s ambassador to Indonesia, Xiao Qian, as “the first high-speed rail of Southeast Asia”.  After nearly three years of delays over land ownership disputes, construction on the rail line, which is financed principally by a $4.5 billion loan from China’s Development Bank, finally kicked into gear in 2018..  The chief executive of Wijaya Karya (WIKA), which heads the Indonesian side of what is the most high-profile of several Belt and Road projects in Indonesia, said that the state-owned construction firm expects to book 266 trillion rupiah ($18.7 billion) from four transit-related developments by 2070. The Indonesian side, which also includes state rail company KAI, owns 60 percent while the Chinese, led by the China Railway Engineering Corporation, holds the rest.  WIKA CEO Tumiyana - who uses only one name -  said that 15 percent of the line has been completed, with 60 percent to be finished by the end of 2019.  Analysts say the plan to develop four new towns and industrial centers mimics China’s own approach to high-speed rail development. “This seems like it’s copying the general model of China’s urban development - if you build it, they will come,” said Nick Marro, a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. One of the sites previously visited by Reuters on an old tea plantation is due to be transformed into a sleek 5,000 hectare city with high-rise blocks and the campus of a new university. Indonesian and Chinese officials say the project’s success will be a gauge for future infrastructure cooperation. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously told Reuters “it’s a major project for the mutual benefit and cooperation between China and Indonesia and helps promote local economic and social development”. Indonesian vice-president Jusuf Kalla recently headed a delegation to China’s BRI forum, where it pitched to Chinese companies for up to $91 billion of infrastructure projects. Jakarta insists on a business-to-business structure for all potential BRI deals instead of China’s traditional government-to-government loan format, which has limited the amount of overall projects.

370,MOVES-Regions beefs up loan platform with focus on broadly syndicated debt - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:07 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK, May 3 (LPC) - Regions is expanding its loan sales and trading platform to the broadly syndicated market, hiring Kevin Dooley as head of loan trading as trade volume in the asset class reached a near-record high in the first quarter. It is looking to add two to three salespeople in the next 12 to 18 months that have client relationships with both middle market and broadly syndicated institutional loan accounts, according to Rob Heffes, head of trading and credit distribution at Regions, who joined the bank in 2016. Dooley joined Regions from Natixis. He previously worked at BNP Paribas, RBS and UBS, according to FINRA BrokerCheck. The move expands Regions’ footprint in the institutional market, where some of the largest companies including American Airlines and Hilton Worldwide turn for financing. The bank had historically focused on so-called pro-rata loans, which include a revolving line of credit and a term loan A, which is typically sold to banks, rather than the broadly syndicated term loan B market, which is typically sold to mutual funds and Collateralized Loan Obligations. Regions had previously focused on pro-rata distribution based on the clients it lent to, but is expanding that focus, Heffes, who previously served as head of credit product sales and trading for CRT Capital and global head of high-yield trading for UBS, said in a telephone interview. “The business model is to support our corporate clients who need broader access to the capital markets, and having tools to allow them to do so,” he said. “We felt we didn’t have the depth to get into the larger rated markets in a material way and that is why we are growing the business.” There was near-record loan trade activity in the first quarter with US$224.2bn of volume, just missing the record of US$224.3bn set in the last three months of 2018 amid increased volatility, according to IHS Markit data. US leveraged loan prices dropped more than 4 percent in the fourth quarter, but have since rebounded, improving 4.1 percent this year through May 2, according to the LPC 100, a cohort of the 100 most widely held loans tracked by LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. “The message is, we have a strategic rationale for being in this business,” Heffes said. “We are going out of our way to find the right talent to bring in so that we can build something that fits Regions’ culture for both issuers and investors, and we will be patient in how we build out the business. We will build it the right way that stays true to the Regions’ mission.” (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing By Michelle Sierra and Jon Methven.)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

371,SoftBank mulls IPO of $100 billion Vision Fund: source - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:01 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is considering an initial public offering of its $100 billion Vision Fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The fund was set up in 2017 and has become the world’s largest technology investment fund. Its investments include ride-hailing pioneer Uber, chip designer ARM and shared workspace firm WeWork. The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund. The senior banking source said Softbank was now talking to banks about helping it raise money, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal. Softbank has spoken to half a dozen banks over the last month about a potential listing of the Vision Fund but has yet to start a formal process, the source said, adding he was not expecting such a process in the near term. “They asked banks questions on how they could possibly do it. It is still very much in exploration mode,” the source said, adding that Softbank had been possibly given the idea by fellow tech investor Naspers, which plans to list some of its assets. “The big difference is that the biggest asset in the Naspers portfolio is Tencent, which is listed, whereas the portfolio of the Vision Fund is all private,” the source said. China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd is a social media and gaming company listed in Hong Kong. A spokesman for Softbank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. SoftBank is also in talks with Oman for an investment in the fund, which has raised nearly all of its funding so far from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to the WSJ report. Oman was not immediately available for a comment when contacted by Reuters, nor was there an immediate response from the Japanese conglomerate.      SoftBank is seeking to raise new funds for “informal deals” chief executive officer Masayoshi Son negotiated in China for Vision Fund, one of the people told WSJ. The fund is also planning to double its staff over the next 18 months to keep up with the pace of deal making by SoftBank, the company’s top deputies reportedly said at a conference in Los Angeles this week.

372,Germany's RWE to review climate lobbying as investor pressure rises - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:47 PM / 4 days ago","2 Min ReadFRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - German utility RWE, under investor pressure as one of Europe’s biggest carbon polluters, said on Friday it would review its lobbying activities to see if they are in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz made the commitment in response to an AGM question from Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager representing Union Investment, which is part of Germany’s cooperative financial services network. Deser had asked whether RWE’s climate strategy was compatible with its lobbying and whether management could demonstrate that those activities did not run counter to its claims of moving towards more sustainable forms of energy. Institutional investors have stepped up pressure on energy firms to take responsibility for their contribution to the greenhouse gases causing climate change and Union Investment is part of a group that has pledged to push for bolder action. Schmitz told shareholders in Essen that RWE would scrutinise the positions adopted by industry associations of which it was a member to see whether they were aligned with the Paris accord. The CEO said RWE, whose huge legacy coal-fired generation capacity in its core markets places it among the biggest carbon polluters in Europe, would publish results in a sustainability report in a year’s time. RWE is committed to spend billions of euros on its planned green energy expansion that will follow an asset swap with rival E.ON later this year.

374,EU leaders set to meet after election: officials - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:33 AM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders are expected to meet just after this month’s elections to the European Parliament, officials said on Friday, as national governments brace for a possible clash with lawmakers over who will run the Brussels executive. Summit chair Donald Tusk is likely to invite leaders to a summit on May 28, two days after the last legislative voting, EU officials told Reuters. He would aim to get a clear mandate from the European Council to negotiate with Parliament on who will succeed European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. It could also be the occasion to review whether the results of the May 23 EU ballot in Britain, following the postponement of Brexit, offer any indication on whether British withdrawal from the European Union is likely to proceed as planned. Aides to Council President Tusk declined official comment.  The EU sources said Tusk, who would represent the 28 member state governments in talks with Parliament over key executive appointments, was likely to confirm the proposed meeting when he chairs another summit next Thursday, in Sibiu, Romania. It is “likely but not confirmed yet”, one official said. Leaders also met two days after the last EU election, in May 2014, to debate whom to nominate to head the Commission. Then, Juncker was clear favorite. The former Luxembourg premier led the center-right list which had come top in the parliamentary vote and was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the face of isolated resistance from then British prime minister David Cameron. This time there may be less clarity, even after the election, and officials are bracing for a showdown between the Council and Parliament that could delay putting a new Commission in place before Juncker’s term ends on Oct. 31. The outgoing Parliament resolved that it would not endorse a Commission nominee from the Council who had not been a leader, or ‘Spitzenkandidat’, from a winning party. But national leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have insisted  they will not be limited in their choice by a legislature whose legitimacy is hampered by chronic low turnouts. As in 2014, the center-right European People’s Party is set to top the poll, putting its lead candidate, German EU lawmaker Manfred Weber, in a position to seek the Commission presidency. His nearest rival would be Juncker’s Dutch deputy, Frans Timmermans, who is the Spitzenkandidat for the center-left. However, neither appears assured of backing by national leaders, for whom the appointment is part of a web of bargains for top jobs that seeks to balance the interests of different countries, types of country, regions and political parties. Other potential - though undeclared - contenders cited by EU officials include Frenchman Michel Barnier, who is Juncker’s  Brexit negotiator, and Danish antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The Council should nominate a Commission president at a June 20-21 summit. Parliament, which convenes on July 2, would then debate the appointment. If it withholds its endorsement beyond July, however, the typical timetable would be in jeopardy.  Only once the Commission president is in place can that person then appoint fellow commissioners for policy areas, drawn from the nominees put forward by each member state. Each of these national nominees must also face parliamentary hearings. Additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Gareth JonesAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

377,A few choice words could lead to better central bank forecasts - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:34 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Central bankers didn’t see the Great Recession coming and they could miss the next downturn too, but new research out of the United States points to a possible way to make their predictions a little more accurate. Economists and investors are increasingly training computers to read central bank reports to better understand policymaking or to make bets in financial markets. A group of researchers at George Washington University has created an index for British economic growth based on the words used in a key section of the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation reports. They found that over the last two decades, the index was a pretty good predictor of how quickly the British economy would grow in the quarter after the release of each report. Their algorithm looks at the frequency of words such as “robust,” “brisk” or “soft” in the summary section of the BoE’s quarterly report. While the central bank’s official forecasts were better at predicting growth, the researchers were surprised to discover the text-based score generally moved up or down in a way that would have improved the accuracy of official forecasts. “The forecasts don’t appear to capture all the information the central bank has about the outlook,” said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and a co-author of a working paper that describes the new research.  Graphic: BOE text scoring - tmsnrt.rs/2Wkku8w Sinclair and her fellow researchers based their approach on a technique, have previously applied to the minutes of Fed policy meetings and the forecasts of Fed staff economists. Like all methods of trying to peer into the future, the text score is not 100 percent reliable – it appeared to overestimate the risks of a British recession in 2001. In early 2008, neither the central bank’s forecasts nor the text recognized that a recession was approaching. However, the text score appeared to predict economic deterioration slightly more quickly that year than did the BoE’s growth forecasts. The text scores have been persistently more dour than the central bank’s official forecasts since the June 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union. In the latest quarterly report released on Thursday, the index remained just below zero, suggesting Britain’s year-over-year growth rate might be slightly slower in the third quarter than the 1.17 percent gain the BoE predicts will be announced in November, Sinclair said. It’s possible the BoE has taken to communicating economic risks over a longer-term horizon during the period following the Brexit referendum, making the word-based index less relevant for the short-term outlook. The text score for Thursday’s report was held back by negative words like “falling,” which the central bank used to describe business investment. Business investment in Britain has been weakening for over a year as companies worry about the country’s still undefined future relationship with the EU, something that could change quickly once the Brexit uncertainty lifts. Researchers have found central bankers often outperform private bankers at forecasting. Indeed, BoE Governor Mark Carney on Thursday pointed out to reporters that the central bank’s forecasts over the last year had been very accurate. “Overall GDP growth appears bang in line with our forecast,” he said, while conceding the BoE had not gotten the drivers of the economy right as consumer spending was stronger than forecast while a bounce-back in business investment and exports had failed to materialize.

378,U.S. Democrats seek up to $2 trillion to invest in aging infrastructure - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  1:59 PM / in a month","4 Min ReadLEESBURG, Va./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in Congress said on Thursday they would seek President Donald Trump’s support in coming weeks for legislation to invest up to $2 trillion to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, including roads, bridges and schools. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at separate news conferences they would try to revive an effort that sputtered early in Trump’s presidency for major investments in aging public works. The White House said Trump had spoken recently with Pelosi  and “agreed to meet soon to discuss working together on infrastructure,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said. Democrats have been seeking a much larger investment than Trump and fellow Republicans in Congress have suggested. “Has to be at least $1 trillion, I’d like it to be closer to $2 trillion,” Pelosi told reporters at a House Democratic meeting in Leesburg, Virginia. She said there would be discussions on how such an amount could be financed.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters later on Thursday that the financing issue was a major obstacle. “I’m all for taking it (infrastructure legislation) up once the president and Democrats, everybody says: ‘OK, here’s how we’re going to pay for it.’ As soon as that magically appears, I think we have a way forward,” McConnell said. Schumer, speaking to reporters outside the U.S. Senate, said a meeting would occur within the next several weeks. “The bottom line is this: If they’re not going to put real money and have real labor and environmental protections, we’re not going to get anywhere,” Schumer warned. Past bipartisan efforts by Democrats and Trump have brought mixed results. A criminal justice bill was enacted, but an immigration reform effort was a dismal failure, as were border security talks. “The president calls people and says: ‘Why don’t we do something?’ but then he’s unwilling to really do anything beyond his hard-right base and nothing gets done,” Schumer complained. But as Republicans and Democrats gear up for the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, they could be eager to show voters accomplishments. Last month, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged Congress to act promptly. Deere said: “The president wants a bipartisan infrastructure package that rebuilds crumbling infrastructure, invests in the projects and industries of tomorrow, and promotes permitting efficiency.” Pelosi was dismissive of Trump’s plan unveiled in February 2017 designed to encourage spending on improvements by states, localities and private investors. Trump had asked Congress to authorize $200 billion over 10 years to spur a projected $1.5 trillion in projects, but it had no new direct federal spending and never got a vote in Congress. “We have to put aside any negative attitudes. We are going there with a positive attitude: How much do you want to invest? How do we prioritize, because we want to do school construction, we want to do public housing, there are other things too,” Pelosi said.

379,Ex-Obama lawyer Craig charged in Mueller spin-off probe for lying about Ukraine work - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  6:45 PM / a month ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Greg Craig, who served as former President Barack Obama’s top White House lawyer, was charged on Thursday with lying about work he performed in 2012 for Ukraine in a case that grew out of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Craig, 74, faces up to 10 years in prison for charges of making false statements and violating a lobbying law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).  He is accused of lying to the Justice Department about his work after he left the White House on a legal review that largely vindicated the prosecution of a political enemy of Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-aligned president of Ukraine at the time. Craig said in a statement he headed a team of lawyers that worked on an independent report for Ukraine’s justice ministry. After researching FARA requirements, they found they did not need to register as foreign agents under the law. “This prosecution is unprecedented and unjustified. I am confident that both the judge and the jury will agree with me,” Craig said. Craig’s lawyers indicated he would plead not guilty. He is scheduled to appear in the U.S. District Court in Washington on Friday. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the New York law firm that produced the report, agreed in January to turn over the $4.6 million it was paid and retroactively register as a foreign agent, as part of a settlement with the Justice Department. Skadden produced the 187-page report at the behest of Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign who is currently serving a 7 1/2-year prison sentence for lobbying violations and financial crimes. Manafort was apparently happy with Craig’s work.  “You are ‘THE MAN,’” he wrote Craig in an email after the report received favorable media coverage, according to the indictment. The report was meant to be an objective review of the Ukrainian government’s prosecution of Yulia Tymoshenko, the country’s former prime minister who was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. It criticized Tymoshenko’s behavior during the trial and concluded that her due-process rights had not been violated, but also said that she had been improperly imprisoned during the trial. The report was used by Yanukovych’s government to justify Tymoshenko’s pretrial detention to the European Court of Human Rights and influence U.S. lawmakers.  Yanukovych was one of Manafort’s main lobbying clients. According to the indictment, Craig covered up aspects of his work in order to avoid registering as a foreign agent under FARA, a rarely enforced law that was enacted in 1938 to counter Nazi propaganda. Had Craig complied with the law, he would have been forced to reveal that funding for the report largely came from Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire. Pinchuk paid the firm $4 million for its work, according to Skadden filings made as part of its settlement. The Ukrainian government only paid Skadden $12,000 - an amount so low that it aroused suspicion in Ukrainian media. Craig also failed to disclose that Skadden was simultaneously helping out with Tymoshenko’s prosecution on other charges, prosecutors say.  “That would do enormous damage to the credibility” of the report, Craig wrote in an email to other Skadden attorneys, according to the indictment. Craig privately had reservations about Tymoshenko’s treatment but left them out of the report, the indictment said. “Evidence of criminal intent - i.e., that she intended to commit a crime - is virtually non-existent,” he wrote in a memorandum that was not included in the report, according to the charges. During his tenure as Obama’s White House counsel from January 2009 to January 2010, Craig led the administration’s unsuccessful effort to shut down the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He also represented former President Bill Clinton during his 1998 Senate impeachment trial.  Another Skadden lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, pleaded guilty last year to lying to investigators about the report.  Craig’s case stems from Mueller’s 22-month investigation into whether Trump’s presidential campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election. That probe led to charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and former key Trump allies, but Attorney General William Barr said last month that Mueller did not find enough evidence to charge Trump or others with criminal conspiracy. Barr also said he decided there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice. He is expected to release a redacted version of Mueller’s final report to Congress next week.

380,U.S. airport-security head named as No. 2 Homeland Security official - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  3:32 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new chief of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) named the United States’ top airport-security official, David Pekoske, his acting deputy on Thursday, as President Donald Trump overhauls the leadership of the domestic-security agency. The move, by Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took office on Wednesday, temporarily fills a leadership vacuum at the top of DHS, which is responsible for everything from border protection to disaster response. But it also places further strains on an agency of 240,000 employees, many of whose top leadership posts were unfilled even before Trump’s management shakeup. McAleenan remains in charge of U.S. Customs and Border Protection even as he assumes responsibility for all of DHS. Likewise, Pekoske will continue to head the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, which screens airline travelers, while he serves as the No. 2 official at DHS. Both men are serving on a temporary basis.  In recent weeks, Trump has interviewed several candidates for DHS secretary, an appointee who must be confirmed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate.  Trump has forced out top DHS officials over the past week as the agency tries to stem rising numbers of immigrants arriving at its southern border, many of them families fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. DHS said it arrested or denied entry to more than 103,000 people along the border last month, more than double the figure for March 2018. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated as DHS officials have told him that dramatic immigration changes he wants are not possible under current law, several sources say. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced her departure on Sunday after clashing with Trump over border security. Her deputy, Claire Grady, stepped down on Tuesday. Trump is trying to force out L. Francis Cissna, who oversees legal immigration programs as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, as well as John Mitnick, the top DHS lawyer, according to a source familiar with White House deliberations.  Leadership is also in flux at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

The Labor Department’s monthly employment report showed jobs increased by 263,000 last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 185,000 rise. The unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March and below the anticipated 0.3% rise. “The volatility in equities is somewhat reasonable given the headline numbers were pretty surprising and very positive in this environment,” said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “It really reiterates Powell’s message on Wednesday, that the economy is in really good shape and inflation is low and that there isn’t any need to make changes to policy right now.” U.S. stocks eased from their record highs in the past two sessions after the Fed dashed hopes of interest rate cuts this year and oil prices fell. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments on weak inflation as mostly “transient” on Wednesday drove down trader bets of a rate cut this year. At 9:45 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128.14 points, or 0.49%, at 26,435.93. The S&P 500 was up 14.31 points, or 0.49%, at 2,931.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.01 points, or 0.63%, at 8,087.79. Nearly 400 S&P 500 companies have reported so far and three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The better-than-expected results have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise from a 2% decline at the start of April. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with a 0.82% rise in consumer discretionary stocks powering the gains. Amazon.com Inc rose 2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 8.2% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Cisco Systems Inc dipped 0.3%, after fellow network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Shares of Arista plunged 15.1%, the most among S&P 500 companies. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.8% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Shares of Electronic Arts Inc also declined 3.5% after brokerage MKM Partners downgraded the company’s stock to “neutral” from “buy.” Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.50-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.60-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 38 new highs and 10 new lows.

The agreement settles a proxy contest with the private equity firm, which nominated five directors to the Canadian miner’s board, two of whom the company accepted before one dropped out. Hudbay shares rose 2.1 percent to C$8.78 in early trading in Toronto, compared with the Toronto stock benchmark’s 0.25 percent gain. “We are not overly surprised as we had assumed that the Board would see only a minor change as a result of Waterton’s efforts,” Mark Llanes, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note. “Overall, we view this settlement positively.” The 11 directors include Chair Alan Hibben and current director Igor Gonzales, whom Waterton had sought to replace, and Waterton nominees Peter Kukielski and Daniel Muniz Quintanilla. The rest, including Chief Executive Alan Hair and David Smith, a Waterton nominee whom Hudbay had already accepted, had not been in dispute. Only votes on the agreed-upon nominees will be considered at Hudbay’s annual shareholder meeting on May 7, the company said. Both companies have also agreed to look for a successor as chair to Hibben following the meeting. After Hibben steps down as chair, he will remain on the board until the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. Waterton, which owns a 12.1 percent stake in Hudbay Minerals, last month sued Hudbay to stop it from soliciting proxies for its annual shareholder meeting, alleging material omissions related to an earlier acquisition attempt. Much of Waterton’s ire against Hudbay surrounded alleged talks the company had to acquire Chile’s Mantos Copper for about $780 million last year, which Bloomberg reported in October.

389,US STOCKS-Strong jobs data set to boost Wall Street at open - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:17 PM / in 4 days","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * U.S. job additions rise solidly above estimates * Amazon.com up as Berkshire Hathaway buys shares * Activision Blizzard falls on weak Q2 profit forecast * Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&P 0.53%, Nasdaq 0.80% (Updates prices, adds details, comments) By Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi   Sanyal May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose in choppy trading on Friday as a surge in job growth in April pointed to a solid domestic economy, while a steady wage growth backed the Federal Reserve’s patient view on interest rate hikes. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report showed jobs increased by 263,000 jobs last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 185,000 rise. The unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March and below the anticipated 0.3% rise. The report was broadly supportive of the U.S. central bank’s decision earlier this week to keep interest rates unchanged. Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments on weak inflation as mostly “transient” also drove down trader bets of a rate cut this year. “The volatility in equities is somewhat reasonable given the headline numbers were pretty surprising and very positive in this environment,” said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “It really reiterates Powell’s message on Wednesday, that the economy is in really good shape and inflation is low and that there isn’t any need to make changes to policy right now.” At 8:59 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 144 points, or 0.55%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.53% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 61.75 points, or 0.8%. Wall Street’s main indexes eased from their record highs in the past two sessions after the Fed dashed hopes of interest rate cuts this year and oil prices fell. More than 350 S&P 500 companies have reported so far and three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The better-than-expected results have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to 0.7% rise from a 2% decline at the start of April. Amazon.com Inc rose 2.6% in premarket trading, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying. Cisco Systems Inc dipped 0.6%, after fellow network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 2.4% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Shares of Electronic Arts Inc also declined 0.7% after brokerage MKM Partners downgraded the company’s stock to “neutral” from “buy.” (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

390,UPDATE 1-Itaú Unibanco sees competition among card processors unlikely to cool down - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:14 PM / 4 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds more CEO comments and context) SAO PAULO, May 3 (Reuters) - The CEO of Brazil’s largest private-sector lender Itaú Unibanco Holding SA said on Friday there is no sign that the fierce competition among card processors in the country will cool down. Chief Executive Candido Bracher said the bank reduced its 2019 targets for fee income and financial margins with clients after its card processor Rede decided to stop charging interest rates to advance payments for merchants who use its machines and pay them in two days instead of the usual 30-day period. Still, Bracher said new targets are unlikely to change the bank’s profit, as Itaú also reduced its estimate for operating expenses growth to a range between 3 percent and 6 percent, from between 5 percent and 8 percent. Bracher said, however, the cut in operating expenses is related to Brazil’s slower-than-expected economic recovery and will affect all Itaú’s areas. Upstart card processors such as PagSeguro Digital Ltd and StoneCo Ltd in recent years have challenged mainstream banks’s card businesses. All Brazilian card processors have fought back Rede’s move and announced new offers for small and mid-sized merchants, in a price war rarely seen in the concentrated Brazilian financial system. “We maintain our call that the aggressive pricing strategy adopted by Rede will have a negative effect on banking fees in the short term, while in the medium-to-long term it should increase the banking franchise’s cross-sell opportunities,” analysts at Banco Santander SA said in a note to clients. Itaú posted a recurring net income of 6.87 billion reais ($1.74 billion) on Thursday, up 7.1% from the year-ago period and roughly in line with a Refinitiv analysts’ consensus estimate.

391,"Trump to hold event Friday on 5G, rural broadband: White House - Reuters","April 11, 2019 /  8:38 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is set to hold a White House event on Friday with the country’s top communications regulator on next-generation 5G wireless networks and efforts to boost rural broadband internet access. A White House spokesman confirmed that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai and Trump would deliver remarks on 5G deployment. Pai is expected to announce additional funds to help rural areas that lack broadband get access to the high-speed service, officials briefed on the  matter told Reuters. The FCC did not immediately comment. In August, Pai said over 700,000 rural homes and small businesses would gain first-ever high-speed internet service through the FCC’s Connect America Fund Phase II auction. In February, Trump called on U.S. telecommunications companies to boost their work to build faster 5G wireless communications networks, saying they were lagging and at risk of being left behind other countries’ efforts. “American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind,” Trump wrote in a pair of tweets. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow reiterated last week that the administration opposed any effort to nationalize the U.S. 5G network and denied the United States was behind other nations in the 5G race.  “The private sector will figure things out far better than the government sector,” he said.     Verizon Communications Inc, AT&T Corp, Sprint Corp and T Mobile US Inc are beginning to deploy 5G service in U.S. cities and are working to extend their networks as 5G-compatible phones slowly become available.     The Trump administration has been seeking ways to speed the deployment of faster wireless communications systems that could help a number of industries. Last year, the FCC moved to eliminate regulatory barriers to 5G deployment by capping local fees and requiring faster application reviews. The Republican president’s administration has also been warning other countries against adopting 5G systems from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, citing security concerns. For more than a year, the White House has been mulling an executive order that would direct the Commerce Department to block U.S. companies from buying equipment from foreign telecommunications makers that pose significant national security risks, Reuters reported in December. The FCC since March 2018 has also been considering rules to bar the use of funds from a government program to purchase equipment or services from companies that pose a security threat to U.S. communications networks. No action on either one of the proposals is expected on Friday. Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

395,"UPDATE 1-Brazil industrial output slumps in March, underscores weak Q1 growth - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  1:02 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(Adds detail, context, quote) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, May 3 (Reuters) - Brazil’s industrial production fell 1.3 percent in March from the month before, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, a steeper fall than economists had expected and another indication of the economy’s sub-par performance in the first quarter. It was the biggest decline in six months, almost double the median estimate of a 0.7 percent fall in a Reuters poll of economists, and weighed heavily on the longer-term measures of industrial output. Production slumped 6.1 percent compared with the same month last year, the biggest annual decline since May last year, IBGE said, although the statistics agency noted that there were 19 working days in March this year compared with 21 last year. Output in the first quarter was down 2.2 percent compared with the January-March period last year, and over the past 12 months production is now down 0.1 percent on the previous 12 months. That’s the first cumulative decline since August 2017, IBGE said. “Today’s weak print increases the risk of a negative quarterly sequential real GDP growth figure for the first quarter of 2019,” wrote Alberto Ramos, head of the Latin American Economic Research at Goldman Sachs, in a note. Brazil’s “long underperforming” industrial sector should slowly start to recover, Ramos said, but will continue to face headwinds from weak activity in Argentina, a major market for Brazilian manufacturing exports. The weak performance was spread across most industries and sectors. Production of intermediary goods fell 1.5 percent on the month, consumer durables fell 1.3 percent and semi- and non-durable consumer goods fell 1.1 percent, IBGE said. In terms of sectors, the 4.9 percent slide in food production was the biggest single contributory factor to the overall decline, IBGE said. Auto production fell 3.2 percent, and petroleum and biofuels products output fell 2.7 percent. In March, Brazil’s central bank reduced its forecast for industrial production growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2.9 percent, a key factor behind the redaction of its overall 2019 GDP growth forecast to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent.

396,CORRECTED-PRECIOUS-Gold eyes worst week since end-March ahead of U.S. jobs data - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:32 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(In fourth paragraph, corrects percentage fall to 1 percent from 10 percent) * U.S. non-farm payrolls data due at 1230 GMT * Gold about 1.2 pct down so far this week * SPDR Gold holdings fall to lowest in nearly 7 months * Platinum touches one-month low By K. Sathya Narayanan May 3 (Reuters) - Gold was steady on Friday as the market awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data but was headed for its biggest weekly decline since the end of March, as the dollar gained after the U.S. central bank doused expectations of a near-term rate cut. Spot gold was steady at $1,270.59 per ounce, as of 1144 GMT. In the previous session, the metal dropped to $1,265.85, its lowest since the end of December. U.S. gold futures were also flat at $1,271.60 an ounce. Gold has fallen more than 1 percent in the last two sessions and is down over 1 percent this week after the U.S. Federal Reserve emphasised it saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut any time soon. “People expected the next move from the Fed to be a rate cut but it doesn’t look like there would be a rate cut anytime soon and the risk of another hike on the table increased after his statement,” Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter Fertig said. “(Right now) people are holding back and are waiting for the U.S. non-farm payrolls data ... the dollar is heading higher which is negative for the precious metals complex.” Better-than-expected non-farm payrolls data tends to boost the dollar, as it would reinforce the economy’s strength, and weigh on gold, analysts said. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting total non-farm employment to have increased by 185,000 jobs in April. The dollar was up about 0.2 percent against key rivals and was on track to post its third straight session of gains. Market participants were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a resolution to the year long tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. A trade deal would boost investors appetite for riskier assets and dent bullion’s safe-haven appeal. Reflecting investor sentiment towards bullion, holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust, fell about 0.2 percent to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. “The ETF holdings in gold continue to decline and in the last few week specs on COMEX switched from net long to net short as there is a risk on approach from investors,” said ING analyst Warren Patterson. Silver was up 0.3 percent at $14.67 per ounce, holding close to a more than four-month low of $14.52 touched in the previous session. Platinum rose 0.5 percent to $851.78 an ounce, having touched a one-month low of $839 earlier in the session, while palladium dipped 0.4 percent to $1,349.30 an ounce. (Reporting by K.

400,"Norway's wealth fund made record returns in first quarter, looking at Uber IPO - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  12:28 PM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadOSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, made record returns on investment in the first quarter  amid a surge in tech stocks.  Separately, the fund is assessing whether to make an investment in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc, which is planning an initial public offering, its chief executive told Reuters. The fund earned 738 billion Norwegian crowns ($84.15 billion) for the January-March period, the highest amount it has ever recorded. When measured in terms of the fund’s international currency basket, the return for the quarter stood at 9.1 percent, beating its benchmark, it added.  “The first quarter was an exceptionally good quarter,” fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told reporters.  Apple Inc made the most positive contribution to the return in the first quarter, the fund said in its quarterly report, followed by Microsoft and Amazon. The investments that made the most negative contributions were pharmaceutical firm AbbVie, bank Swedbank and U.S. consumer services firm CVS Health. Overall, out of the 10 largest equity holdings in the fund, five of them are U.S. tech companies. The top three equity holdings are Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet.  The fund participated in the initial public offerings of tech firms Lyft and Weimob in the first quarter, and in the present quarter it is examining the listings of two large companies, including that of Uber, Slyngstad said. The fund has previously said it wished more companies, and particularly tech companies, had sought public listings, enabling the fund to invest in these fast-growing companies. Slyngstad welcomed the recent wave of public listings by tech firms, but reiterated that they could be seeking listings at an earlier stage so the fund can capture the fruits of their growth. “This development of these large unicorns coming to the exchanges is something we view positively,” Slyngstad said in an interview on the sidelines of a news conference.      “We are of course pleased that more companies have decided to go to the stock exchanges. We appreciate the transparency and the liquidity of the public markets. “From our point of view, an earlier listing is better than a later listing.” Editing by Terje Solsvik and Larry KingAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

401,REFILE-GRAPHIC-Take Five: Vol squall coming? World markets themes for the week ahead - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:52 AM / in 4 days","7 Min Read(Refiles to fix dateline; no change in text) May 3 (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/SELL IN MAY? With cross-asset volatility  at record lows, it’s a great backdrop for investors to load up on risk. Reams have been written on the reasons for falling volatility, but logic attributes it first to major central banks’ recent tilt back into dovishness, and second to the global economy’s tepid but steady expansion with few inflation surprises. So low is cross-asset vol that a gauge compiled by brokerage INTL FcStone stands 3.6 standard deviations below the mean. In other words, it deems that a vol surge has less a 0.02 percent probability of occurring. And with that has come willingness to go short safe assets such as gold or Treasuries, and on protective hedges such as the VIX. (The latter is a measure of how much S&P500 options are expected to fluctuate, essentially a vol gauge). Outstanding shorts on VIX futures have reached record highs, CFTC data shows, surpassing the build-up seen before last February’s “Volmageddon” blowup. Unsurprisingly, some market watchers advise caution. As Volmageddon showed, vol can spike spectacularly in a quiet market, sometimes driven by just one unexpected data point. After all, if the old adage holds, some people may be looking to sell in May and go away. -LIVE MARKETS-The flows, volatility, and shorts conundrum -Half-time: Europe Inc scores to avert Q1 disaster, hopes of a rebound rise -Corporate profits and U.S. economy chug along, defying recession fears 2/GIMME HOPE Data: more important than usual these days as markets try to decide whether the green shoots cropping up in some places are the real deal. Take the euro zone. Growth was faster than expected in the first quarter, after slumping in the second half of 2018. U.S. and Chinese first-quarter GDP surpassed expectations, too, while the Bank of England has just raised growth forecasts for 2019. So will upcoming data — U.S. and Chinese trade numbers — surprise to the upside as well? Germany releases industrial orders figures on Tuesday, and Friday brings a raft of British data, including first-quarter GDP. For sure, one week of brighter data isn’t enough to shift entrenched pessimism. So while Citi’s economic surprise indexes for Europe and United States have started ticking higher, they remain in negative territory. Nor have brighter growth numbers managed to lift German 10-year bond yields much above zero percent yet. But keep watching that data. -Factories on the mend in April but still struggling -China’s Q1 growth unexpectedly steadies, but too early to call clear recovery -Bank of England ups growth view, Brexit keeps rate rise on ice 3/“TRANSITORY” WEAKNESS? This month’s Fed meeting saw Chairman Jerome Powell play down recent weakness in U.S. inflation as “transitory” and declare the policy stance “appropriate”. His failure to give any hints that the central bank was weighing interest-rate cuts disappointed the S&P500 and pushed money markets to slash rate-cut bets for this year to around 40 percent from over 60 percent. It will also have earned Powell the ire of President Donald Trump, who has slammed the Fed boss for not doing more to support the economy. So is Powell right in his view of inflation? Some recent indicators, from first-quarter growth to factory orders to productivity, have been pretty strong. The flip side is manufacturing is growing more slowly and inventories are building. So we’ll need to see whether consumer and producer inflation figures due May 9 and 10 confirm the inflation backdrop is indeed transient. -U.S. Fed sees no strong case for hiking or cutting rates -Fed rate cut likely if U.S. manufacturing continues to slow: Kemp -U.S. factory activity at 2-1/2-year low, points to slowing economy 5/TECH TALK Forecast-smashing results from Facebook, Amazon and Apple have laid to rest any short-term worries about the so-called FAANG group of tech titans. Google and Netflix, the other members of the cohort, were less sweet but not disastrous. Hopes now are that Asian Big Tech will confirm the comeback signals — mid-May is when China’s Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent update us on their earnings. For MSCI’s global tech index, net earnings revisions are at their strongest in over six months. With 60 percent of IT companies having reported so far, almost 90 percent have beaten expectations, according to UBS. Coming after a string of downgrades before March, that’s a relief. However, global tech earnings growth is expected to slow, compared with 2018. But after two years of double-digit growth, a pullback may represent a return to normal rather than a worrying drop. It’s more than likely that growth-hungry investors will return to backing big tech. -Apple’s upbeat forecast pushes market value back toward $1 trillion -Wedbush rates Uber ‘outperform,’ sees FAANG becoming ‘FAAUNG -Wall Street’s record run hits snag after Alphabet tumbles 5/HOLD OR(R) LOWE(R)? Who will cut interest rates first – Adrian Orr or Philip Lowe? The Reserve Bank of Australia, run by Lowe, meets on May 7, followed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, headed by Orr, a day later. Both have the same story to tell – low inflation, strong labour markets and limited room to cut interest rates. Both economies have strong links with China, where growth is slowing. Lowe has the added complication of a federal election in May. Orr will be dealing with a new monetary policy committee that now includes external members. The rising Aussie-kiwi exchange rate suggests investors see a greater chance of a cut in New Zealand. If the RBA, which has held policy steady for 29 meetings, cuts on Tuesday, the RBNZ would have more reason to do so. Three other Asian central banks also meet — Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The last says rate cuts are inevitable. But many expect the other two to deliver easing signals as well. -Australia’s shrinking monetary policy arsenal tests RBA’s orthodoxy – -New Zealand c.bank set for knife-edge rate decision next week -GRAPHIC-The only way is down: Emerging central banks keep cutting rates Reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York, Vidya Ranganathan in

402,Spain will not allow its Venezuela embassy to become centre of political activity - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:22 PM / in 4 days","1 Min ReadMADRID, May 3 (Reuters) - Spain will not allow its embassy in Caracas, Venezuela, to be used as a political centre for opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, acting Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said in Lebanon on Friday. Lopez, an ally of opposition leader Juan Guaido, took refuge at the Spanish residence with his wife and children earlier this week after an attempted military uprising against the government failed. “Spain will not permit its embassy to be converted in to a centre of political activity by Mr Lopez, or anyone else,” Borrell said on the sidelines of a conference in Beirut. On Thursday, the Spanish government said it had no intention of turning over Lopez to Venezuelan authorities.

404,Beto O'Rourke's past support for charter schools scrutinized in 2020 White House bid - Reuters,"April 11, 2019 /  10:10 AM / in a month","6 Min ReadEL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - Democrat Beto O’Rourke has called for investment in a “world-class public school system” and says teachers make up the single biggest professional group contributing to his 2020 presidential campaign. But several teacher groups say the former Texas congressman’s support for charter schools in recent years is complicating his efforts to secure their backing in his White House bid. Charter schools, most of which are publicly funded but often privately run, are a complicated issue for Democrats. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama supported them, viewing them as giving school choice to lower-income families. Charter schools have grown across the country in response to demand from parents for different options from traditional public schools. Many charter school employees are not unionized.  But some teachers unions say they divert state and federal funds from public schools. They have raised O’Rourke’s past positive comments about charter schools, as well as his wife’s ties to them through her work, as points of concern as they scrutinize the Democratic field. “We’re going to have to get a lot of questions answered by Beto,” said Norma De La Rosa, president of the El Paso Teachers Association in O’Rourke’s hometown. “At this point, I would be wary and I think a lot of my colleagues are going to hit him hard on these points.” Teachers and their unions are being eagerly courted by the large slate of Democrats seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination to run against President Donald Trump, the expected Republican nominee. Educators are a key voting bloc in state nominating contests and have flexed their political muscle in the past two years with a wave of strikes and protests over better pay and resources.  U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential contender from California, has proposed giving teachers an average $13,500 annual pay raise as a central part of her pitch to primary voters. The politics of charter schools has shifted since some prominent Democrats lent their support. Public schools have seen their budgets cut since the 2008 financial crash, hardening opposition to charters among many teachers. The Trump administration’s strong support for charter schools has also increased Democratic antipathy. Another 2020 Democratic candidate, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, also is drawing scrutiny for his support for school choice and charter schools when he was mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Aides to O’Rourke say he is unequivocal in his support for public schools and has never taken any action to advance charter schools over them. He and his wife send their children to the same El Paso public school O’Rourke attended. “Beto has been a strong and consistent advocate for public school classrooms in Texas and across the country,” Chris Evans, a spokesman for O’Rourke, said in an email. “He has made it clear that our focus should be on, and our taxpayer funds should go toward, public school classrooms where the overwhelming majority of American students attend. He believes we should be paying teachers a living wage.” O’Rourke thinks charter schools “should have comprehensive oversight and accountability to the taxpayer,” Evans added  But O’Rourke’s past statements about charter schools give some public education advocates pause. In 2016, when O’Rourke voted against a federal voucher program in Washington, D.C., he said money should be invested in “proven educational models such as charter schools.” In 2015, O’Rourke said he voted for the Every Student Succeeds Act - which passed Congress with bipartisan support - in part because it gave parents choices by “investing in new charter school models.” During a 2012 Democratic primary debate when he first ran for Congress, O’Rourke called charter schools “a good idea” because they encourage competition and innovation.  O’Rourke’s wife, Amy, works for an organization in El Paso that backs the expansion of charter schools in the area. In 2007, she opened a dual-language elementary charter school in a low-income neighborhood of El Paso. Evans said Amy O’Rourke’s work had been focused on expanding opportunities for students in underserved communities. Anthony Cody, co-founder of the Network for Public Education Action, a national advocacy group for public schools that opposes charter schools, said his organization found O’Rourke’s past comments and his wife’s work in the charter school world “hugely problematic.” Noel Candelaria, president of the Texas State Teachers Association, which opposes the expansion of charter schools in Texas, said it would be important for O’Rourke to make clear to his organization “where he stands on charter schools” now before he wins an endorsement. The association endorsed O’Rourke during his unsuccessful Senate bid last year against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the country’s second-largest teachers union, defended O’Rourke’s “nuanced” view of charter schools. “For us, it’s not ‘charters good or bad,’ and if you listen to Beto’s actual comments about public schools and charter schools, he gets to the same position: They can’t siphon money from public schools, they can’t take fewer kids with special needs.” Weingarten said she recently talked with O’Rourke. “I think when he toured the (Mexican) border and spoke to teachers, it was very transformational for him,” she said. “People’s positions evolve over time.”    Reporting by Tim Reid; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

405,"Facebook, Google accused of anti-conservative bias at U.S. Senate hearing - Reuters","April 10, 2019 /  9:35 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Wednesday said Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc  discriminate against conservative viewpoints and suppress free speech, suggesting anti-trust action could be a solution. Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the Senate Judiciary subcommittee, said many Americans believe big tech firms are biased against conservatives and pointed to some anecdotal examples. While no one wants “government speech police,” he said there are other remedies. “If we have tech companies using the powers of monopoly to censor political speech, I think that raises real antitrust issues,” Cruz said at a U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. Facebook, Twitter and Google denied their platforms are politically biased, and Democratic lawmakers said there was no evidence to back Republican bias claims although Democrats have criticized the firms on other grounds.  The Senate hearing was a sign that Republicans do not intend to relent in their year-old campaign against the tech companies. Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump again accused social media firms of favoring Democratic opponents without offering evidence. “We do have a political bias issue here,” Republican Senator Mike Lee said. Senators also raised the prospect that Congress could remove  protections under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that give online platforms broad immunity for what users post.  Senator Mazie Hirono, the top Democrat on the panel, said Republicans claims are based on “nothing more than a mix of anecdotal evidence... and a failure to understand the companies algorithms and content moderation practices.” Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren said Facebook last month removed ads her campaign placed calling for Facebook’s breakup. “I want a social media marketplace that isn’t dominated by a single censor,” she said. Carlos Monje, Twitter’s public policy director, said the site “does not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules.” Facebook public policy director Neil Potts said the company “does not favor one political viewpoint over another, nor does Facebook suppress conservative speech.” Senator Josh Hawley told the firms they are not being transparent in how they make decisions. “This is a huge, huge problem,” he said. Hirono said, “We cannot allow the Republican party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful, dangerous and misleading content.” Google was disinvited over a dispute about whether it offered an executive senior enough to testify. The panel left an empty chair for Google. Cruz said he plans a future hearing to address what he called “Google’s censorship of free speech.” Google said in a written statement submitted to the committee that it works to ensure “our products serve users of all viewpoints and remain politically neutral” but it acknowledged that “sometimes our content moderation systems do make mistakes.”  Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Cynthia OstermanAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

406,U.S. lawmakers propose bill to fight bias in tech companies' algorithms - Reuters,"April 10, 2019 /  10:51 PM / in a month","3 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers proposed a bill on Wednesday that would require major tech companies to detect and remove any discriminatory biases embedded in their computer models, underscoring Washington’s growing interest in regulating Silicon Valley. The bill, entitled the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, would grant new power to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and force companies to study if race, gender or other biases underpin their technology. The rules would apply to companies with annual revenue above $50 million as well as to data brokers and businesses with over a million consumers’ data. “Computers are increasingly involved in the most important decisions affecting Americans’ lives – whether or not someone can buy a home, get a job or even go to jail,” Democratic Senator Ron Wyden said in a press release announcing the bill. “But instead of eliminating bias, too often these algorithms depend on biased assumptions or data that can actually reinforce discrimination against women and people of color.” The press release cited as examples a Reuters report that Amazon.com Inc had scrapped an automated recruiting engine it had found to be biased against women, and U.S. charges that Facebook Inc let advertisers discriminate by race in alleged violation of the Fair Housing Act. Senator Cory Booker and Representative Yvette Clarke, both Democrats, joined Wyden in introducing the bill, which could face an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Senate. “To hold algorithms to a higher standard than human decisions implies that automated decisions are inherently less trustworthy or more dangerous than human ones, which is not the case,” said Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit that includes industry representatives on its board. “This would only serve to stigmatize and discourage AI use, which could reduce its beneficial social and economic impacts,” Castro said. The Internet Association, which counts Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet Inc’s Google and other top tech companies as members, had no immediate comment.

Europe’s bourses nudged fractionally higher early on as earnings from banks HSBC and Societe Generale cheered traders and encouraging Adidas profits < ADSGn.DE> sent the German sportswear firm’s shares leaping 7 percent to a record high. The dollar was also trying to end the week on a firmer note having seen markets scale back bets on a U.S. rate cut this week. As well as the jobs figures later, there are no less than eight Federal Reserve policymakers due to speak. Bond and commodity markets remained firmly on the backfoot however with most benchmark government bond yields up on the day and Brent oil slipping back towards $70 a barrel again for what will be its worst week in over two months. Fund manager UBP strategist Koon Chow said it all pointed to a little bit of the steam coming out of the markets after a flying start to the year. “For the last four months it has been the unwinding the extreme pessimism that had built up (last year)” he said, referring to trade war nerves and the slowdown in many of the world’s largest economies. “So here we are now in search of the next big thing, and I think today, and for the last few weeks, it is a views and portfolio repositioning exercise.” U.S. employment figures are due at 1230 GMT, which are forecast to show 185,000 net new jobs were added in April and the unemployment rate at a steady 3.8 percent. A report by payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs last month. A solid official reading later would bolster the notion the world’s biggest economy remains on track for its longest expansion ever, further boosting the dollar potentially and the prospects for corporate earnings. Overnight Asian trading had remained thin with both Japan and China traders still enjoying holidays. Hong Kong was in though and climbed 0.4 percent , the Australian market gained 0.1 percent, while Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.5 percent. Overnight on Wall Street, major indices,, had given up an initial attempt to regain their record highs and closed in the red, weighed down by energy shares. Oil prices had plunged again after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying political crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was still in the red in early London trade down 0.3 percent at $61.65 a barrel, while Brent slipped 0.5 percent to $70.42. In the currency markets, Australian and New Zealand dollars both fell as speculators wagered both countries could see interest cuts next week. The Aussie slipped below psychological support of $0.7000 overnight to the lowest since early January while the kiwi dollar drifted closer to a recent five-month trough of $0.6581. The weakness in the antipodean currencies also came as the U.S. dollar gained on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week that a recent weakness in inflation owed to “transitory” factors. That led traders to start paring expectations for a Fed rate cut. Futures now imply about a 49 percent probability of an easing at year-end, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. The dollar index held at 97.842, inching towards a two-year peak of 98.33 touched last week. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was little changed at 111.48 having spent the entire week in a tight 111.03-111.89 range, while the euro stayed closed to $1.12 Reporting by Marc JonesAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

MSCI’s index for emerging market currencies slipped for a second straight session as the U.S. dollar stayed broadly firm with the focus on the Turkish lira which edged closer to near seven-month lows. Turkey’s inflation came in slightly lower than expected for March although annual inflation eased from a 15-year peak of above 25 percent in October. “The data shows impact of very depressed domestic demand conditions, with little pricing pressure from cooperates,” said Timothy Ash at Blue Bay Asset Management “Some will also focus on the continued maintenance of price controls and question how accurate or realistic these inflation numbers are now,” said Timothy Ash at BlueBay Asset Management. Later in the day all eyes will be on a Fitch rating for the recession-hit country, with markets pricing in a downgrade. South Africa’s rand was on track to end lower for a third straight week with investors looking forward to a national election next Wednesday. A clean sweep for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress looks certain but the size of his majority will be pivotal in dictating the future of his presidency. Falling oil prices benefit crude importer India’s rupee while export major Russia’s rouble tread water. Stock indices across emerging markets were more mixed with light trading in Asia as Mainland Chinese markets remained shut for a holiday. Hong Kong stocks edged higher, but South Korea’s Kospi index shed over half a percent. In emerging Europe, there is some expectation for an upgrade from Moody’s for Hungary’s credit rating, but the forint barely moved against the euro with the country being within investment grade. Investors also await U.S. employment figures due later in the day, which is forecast to show 185,000 net new jobs were added in April and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8 percent.

409,"UPDATE 2-Storms, floods, Boeing crash hit Swiss Re Q1 profit - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  5:52 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read* Q1 net profit falls to $429 mln vs consensus $657 mln * Large claims for natural and man-made disasters weigh * Readies IPO for British ReAssure business but open to trade sale (Adds CFO comments, market reaction) By Michael Shields ZURICH, May 3 (Reuters) - Reinsurer Swiss Re AG’s reported an unexpected 6 percent fall in quarterly net profit on Friday as claims from large losses offset higher net premiums and a solid return on investments. Net profit came in at $429 million, below the $657 million market consensus compiled www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:c88bcc1f-9836-4ede-b3c6-540c7df2fa01/q1-2019-published-versus-consensus-table.pdf by the global insurance and reinsurance giant. Claims from large natural catastrophes and man-made losses included $210 million from North Queensland floods in Australia, Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and $90 million from the Ethiopian Airlines crash and subsequent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX fleet. Late claims from prior-year events, mainly from Typhoon Jebi, also weighed, it added. Its shares fell 3.5 percent in early trade. ZKB analysts noted that profit was worse-than-expected despite good results from life and health reinsurance and a 4.5 percent return on investment. Finance chief John Dacey said the $90 million hit from the Boeing crash was Swiss Re’s best estimate of its exposure while it tries to work out more details. “Our team has done the best they can in working with other insurers that are on risk here, looking at the policies that Boeing has to try to estimate how much of those policies are likely to be paid out,” he told reporters on a call. It remained unclear what potential damages airlines may claim from Boeing for not being able to manage their own fleets. Swiss Re’s in-house aviation experts were talking with Boeing and other insured parties including the lead insurers to try to get the best estimate of the damage, he said. Liability claims related to the Ethiopian crash and fleet grounding could be the largest non-war aviation reinsurance claim on record, broker Willis Re said last month. The crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 on March 10 killed 157 passengers and crew, the second deadly crash involving a Boeing Co 737 MAX 8 airliner in five months. In other news, Swiss Re was pressing ahead with preparations to float British closed-book business ReAssure but remains open to a last-minute trade sale, Dacey said. Swiss Re said it was upbeat for its property and casualty business while life and health continued to perform strongly. But its corporate solutions segment, which made a loss in the first quarter, continued to present challenges. The group was taking measures to address performance issues there during a review due to wrap up in the second quarter.

Sterling was little moved by a relatively hawkish message from the Bank of England on Thursday, as investors continue to focus on persistent political uncertainty surrounding when, how and on what terms Britain will leave the European Union. Economic data has also had relatively little impact on the pound in recent months, but investors will be watching for his Purchasing Managers’ Index survey for the services sector due at 0830 GMT. The pound traded 0.1 percent lower at $1.3023 after rising above $1.31 briefly earlier in the week. Against the euro the British currency was unchanged at 85.76 pence. The BoE said on Thursday that markets should expect a bigger degree of rate tightening in the next few years than they currently assume if the economy grows as policymakers expect and inflation is to be brought back to target. Few analysts are convinced the bank will act before Brexit uncertainty is lifted, however. “We believe that persistent Brexit uncertainty combined with concerns over slowing growth overseas will deter the BoE from delivering a more immediate rate hike. We remain sceptical that cross party Brexit talks between the government and Labour will prove successful,” MUFG analysts wrote.

Sporadic signs of recovery in European business activity have not helped the euro break out of the $1.11-1.14 range it’s been stuck in since February. Euro zone manufacturing surveys released on Thursday showed further contraction in April. The threat of U.S. tariffs on European automobiles and upcoming European elections have also weighed on the currency, analysts said. The dollar has edged higher since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down a recent slowing in inflation and said he saw no reason to cut interest rates. The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.1172, having eased back from $1.1219 overnight, though it was still stronger on the week. The dollar index reached 97.844 against a basket of currencies, up from a low of 97.149 earlier in the week. Some traders speculated the dollar would gain further if U.S. jobs data on Friday came in better than expected. “‘Sell in May and go away’. With the dollar strong at the moment and emerging markets performing on the soft side, today’s jobs data could well give that market adage a little more legs,” said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING in London. It has been a quiet week for major currencies. Volatility was at multi-year lows and liquidity was limited with Japan and China on extended holidays. The British pound has gained 1.3 percent amid tentative hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit talks. The Australian and New Zealand dollars have weakened on speculation both countries will cut interest rates next week. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on May 7 and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand a day after. Each may cut rates after low inflation reports. Money markets are now pricing in a 49 percent chance the Fed will cut rates this year, down from more than 61 percent before Powell’s remarks. The pricing may change again after the U.S. jobs report for April is released. Forecasts are for payrolls to rise by 185,000 with unemployment at 3.8 percent.

In the previous session, the metal dropped to $1,265.85, its lowest since end-December. The bullion has shed about 1.2 percent so far this week. U.S. gold futures eased 0.1 percent to $1,271.20 an ounce. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation risks flagged during the release of the U.S. GDP data were only based on transitory factors, and that there was no obligation to readjust interest rates any time soon. “An unwinding of excessively bullish positioning for a dovish Fed has put a hammer on gold,” said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst with OANDA. The Fed decision lifted U.S. Treasury yields to a one-week high, while the dollar looked set to end the week on a firmer note as markets scaled back bets on a U.S. rate cut. The greenback has edged higher since Powell played down the recent slowing in inflation and saw no reason to cut interest rates. “The dollar will continue to strengthen and (10-year) treasury yields are still going to hover around higher levels. We haven’t seen anything from U.S. data that suggests a slowdown there, so gold is going to be under pressure in the near term,” Halley added. However, while major hubs - China and Japan remain shut for holidays, Asian shares at large were subdued, restraining a further downward slide for the gold market, analysts said. “From a technical point of view, there is a first support level (for gold) at $1,266, while the previous support levels of $1,280 and 1,288 now represent a resistance area for prices,” ActiveTrades chief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa said in a note from Thursday. Reflecting investor sentiment in gold, holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.16 percent to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. The market eyes the U.S. non-farm payrolls data to gauge the country’s economic performance. Analysts widely expect that U.S. employers maintained a strong hiring pace in April. Silver was unchanged at $14.63 per ounce, holding close to a more than four-month low of $14.52 touched in the previous session. Platinum rose 0.7 percent to $854.12 an ounce, having touched a one-month trough of $839 earlier in the session, while palladium edged up 0.1 percent to $1,356 an ounce.

Investors awaited a range of data points due later in the day including euro zone producer prices for March and U.S. non-farm payrolls for April. The latter are forecast to show an addition of 185,000 net new jobs. The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged 0.1 percent higher by 0706 GMT, although it was on course to close the week down 0.5 percent, which would be its worst weekly loss in six weeks. Adidas led the benchmark as shares in the sportswear maker rose about 7 percent after it reported a rise in quarterly net profit thanks to high-margin ecommerce even as overall sales growth slowed. The personal and household goods sector was the top performing STOXX 600 sub-sector in early trade, with a 0.6 percent rise. Bank stocks rose half a percent, supported by a 1.8 percent rise in the London-listed shares of HSBC Holdings PLC after the lender beat quarterly profit estimates, bolstered by a surge in income from its core Asian business. Societe Generale gained 2 percent as the French bank’s capital buffer was stronger than expected, helping investors look past a fall in quarterly net profit. Basic resources stocks gained 0.6 percent as copper prices rose. London-listed Anglo American Plc tacked on 1.3 percent as Credit Suisse upgraded the miner to “outperform” from “neutral” and raised its price target on the stock. InterContinental Hotels fell 3.6 percent and was the biggest drag on the travel and leisure index, which declined 0.8 percent. The hotel group said weakness in the Greater China region caused its quarterly room revenue to slow. Air France-KLM slid 3 percent as the Franco-Dutch group blamed higher fuel costs and tough price competition for its first-quarter loss although it said pressure would ease in the rest of the year. Dublin’s ISEQ dipped 0.4 percent. A survey showed Irish services sector growth slowed in April as Brexit worries hit sales.

417,Bernie Sanders puts focus on healthcare with Medicare for All bill - Reuters,"April 10, 2019 /  7:04 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled the latest version of his ambitious “Medicare-for-All” plan on Wednesday, moving the healthcare debate among Democratic presidential contenders to center stage in the 2020 race. The Sanders plan, similar to his 2017 proposal that languished in the Senate, would largely eliminate private insurance and shift all Americans into a Medicare-based government-run healthcare plan that Republicans have criticized as too costly and radical. The bill has 14 Democratic co-sponsors in the Senate, including four of his presidential rivals - Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. The other White House contender in the Senate, Amy Klobuchar, supports universal healthcare and expanding Medicare but has not committed to plans that would eliminate private insurance. A similar measure in the House of Representatives has more than 100 co-sponsors. “The current debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with healthcare; it has everything to do with greed and profiteering,” Sanders said at a Capitol Hill event to roll out the proposal, where he was joined by Gillibrand. “This is a struggle for the heart and soul of who we are as the American people,” he said. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who mounted an unsuccessful 2016 White House run, has turned the proposal, once dismissed as too fringe, into a centerpiece of the Democratic Party’s agenda heading into the 2020 White House race. At least 10 other Democrats vying for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in 2020 have backed some similar form of government-run healthcare, and every Democrat supports taking at least smaller steps toward achieving universal coverage. Other prominent Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have urged the party to focus on protecting and strengthening the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, which Trump and Republicans have vowed to dismantle. The Sanders proposal, which has little chance of passage in the Republican-run Senate, expands on his old bill to include coverage of home and community-based long-term care services for people with disabilities. Sanders does not put a price tag on the proposal, but would raise revenues to help pay for it through a combination of taxes on employers, individuals, businesses and the wealthy. He suggests that healthcare spending and administrative costs would decrease and costs for consumers would be reduced. The liberal Urban Institute estimated the earlier Sanders plan would cost $32 trillion over a decade, with the additional taxes raising about $15 trillion. Republicans have criticized the bill as a socialist pipe dream that would be too costly and weaken the U.S. healthcare system. They have promised to make it a key election issue in 2020. “It’s the same tired, debunked logic that Washington, D.C., knows best and the American people can’t be trusted to decide what’s best for themselves and their families,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said.

418,Pelosi: Attorney General Barr 'off the rails' on Mueller report - Reuters,"April 10, 2019 /  9:09 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadLEESBURG, Va. (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi castigated Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday for comments he made during congressional hearings this week about the federal probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election. “Let me just say, I’m very, very dismayed and disappointed that the chief law enforcement officer of our country is going off the rails yesterday and today,” Pelosi told reporters at a Democratic Party retreat in Virginia. “He is attorney general of the United States of America, not the attorney general of Donald Trump.” Pelosi said Democrats first of all want to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and any links to the Trump campaign.  Russia’s activities were an assault on U.S. democracy -  “there is no doubt about that,” Pelosi said.  During two congressional hearings this week, Barr defended his handling of the 400-page report Mueller submitted to him on March 22 after a two-year investigation.  It was the attorney general released a four-page letter to Congress providing a broad outline of its assessments. Barr said he would make public a redacted version of the report next week. Democrats have been calling for full disclosure. Barr, who was appointed by Trump, said on Wednesday he would look into whether U.S. agencies illegally spied on Trump’s 2016 campaign, but acknowledged under sharp questioning by lawmakers that there was no evidence of wrongdoing.

420,Wesfarmers' soft bid for Kidman spotlights lithium's financing issues - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:28 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadMELBOURNE (Reuters) - Wesfarmers Ltd’s bid for Australia’s Kidman Resources undervalues the lithium miner, analysts said on Friday, reflecting the financing difficulties the sector faces even as electric car makers warn of raw material shortages. Wesfarmers offered a 47 percent premium for Kidman, which is developing the Mount Holland project in Western Australia through a joint venture with battery chemicals maker Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM). But even that offer, which valued the company at A$776 million ($543 million) or A$1.90 per share, undervalued the company, said analysts at J.P. Morgan and Canaccord Genuity. Prospects for lithium demand look strong over the next decade as governments worldwide set ambitious targets to increase electric vehicle sales. In May 2018, Kidman signed a lithium supply agreement with electric carmaker Tesla, which this week forecasts a shortage of key electric vehicle minerals occurring in the future. JP Morgan said that Wesfarmers’ share price bid “fundamentally undervalues” Kidman’s share of the joint venture, adding that Mount Holland is a “Tier-1” project. Canaccord said the bid “falls short” of their valuation of A$2.15 per share for Kidman. Both companies say there is the potential for a third party to place a higher bid for Kidman.  “The chance of an interloper seeing greater value in Kidman, either joint venture partner SQM or an outside party, is real,” said JPMorgan.  Kidman shares closed on Friday just below the offer price at $A1.87.  Part of the reason for the lower valuation stems from problems the lithium mining sector has faced in gaining financing for their projects.  The Mount Holland site reportedly will require about A$600 million in capital. SQM has pledged $100 million to the project.  Miners have struggled with financing as retail equity markets do not provide the scale of funding they need and banks have been reluctant since it is not easy to hedge their lithium price risk.       “It’s next to impossible to hedge so therefore project financing becomes really difficult,” said Aaron Ross, global head of resources at ANZ at an industry event in Melbourne. Large auto and battery makers could seek equity stakes in companies instead of signing supply off-take agreements, as Chinese companies have done, said Ross.  Diversified miners that have started to accumulate cash could also step in, with Rio Tinto, South 32 and Fortescue all looking to get into lithium, said Reg Spencer, mining analyst at Canaccord, with Rio Tinto best placed because it already has lithium exposure. “It’s perfect timing really from Wesfarmers. It’s hard, the banks and not many other people are prepared to fund those things at the moment,” said Andy Forster, senior investment officer at Argo Investments, adding that Mount Holland is one of the better lithium projects around. “I’d be surprised if anyone else came over the top, but never say never.” Reporting by Melanie Burton; editing by Christian SchmollingerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

421,FOREX-Euro succumbs to dollar lifted by upbeat U.S. payrolls talk - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:02 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read* U.S. yields higher as market cools bets on Fed rate cut * Dollar recoups losses to be little changed on week * Market awaits April payrolls, host of Fed speakers * AUD, NZD under pressure as rate-cut speculation builds * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices) By Tom Finn LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - A brief rally in the euro petered out on Friday with political uncertainty and the threat of economic decline in Europe pulling the currency down against the dollar. Sporadic signs of recovery in European business activity have not helped the euro break out of the $1.11-1.14 range it’s been stuck in since February. Euro zone manufacturing surveys released on Thursday showed further contraction in April. The threat of U.S. tariffs on European automobiles and upcoming European elections have also weighed on the currency. The dollar has edged higher since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell played down a recent slowing in inflation and said he saw no reason to cut interest rates. The euro was down 0.2 percent at $1.1155, having eased back from $1.1219 overnight, though it was still stronger on the week. The dollar index reached 97.986 against a basket of currencies, up from a low of 97.149 earlier in the week. Some traders speculated the dollar would gain further if U.S. jobs data on Friday came in better than expected. “‘Sell in May and go away’. With the dollar strong at the moment and emerging markets performing on the soft side, today’s jobs data could well give that market adage a little more legs,” said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING in London. It has been a quiet week for major currencies. Volatility was at multi-year lows and liquidity was limited with Japan and China on extended holidays. The British pound has gained 1.3 percent amid tentative hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit talks. The Australian and New Zealand dollars have weakened on speculation both countries will cut interest rates next week. The Reserve Bank of Australia meets on May 7 and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand a day after. Each may cut rates after low inflation reports. Money markets are now pricing in a 49 percent chance the Fed will cut rates this year, down from more than 61 percent before Powell’s remarks. The pricing may change again after the U.S. jobs report for April is released. Forecasts are for payrolls to rise by 185,000 with unemployment at 3.8 percent.

422,Wall Street Weekahead: Record-breaking rally leaving energy stocks behind - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:13 AM / 4 days ago","5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market surge since the start of the year that has sent the benchmark S&P 500 index up to new record highs is leaving behind one sector that typically outperforms in an expanding economy: energy.  A sharp rebound in the price of oil has not been enough to offset a long-standing reluctance on the part of investors to hold energy companies after prices collapsed in 2014. Energy companies in the S&P 500 are down 13% over the last year, while the broad index is up 10%. Over the last 5 years, energy companies have sunk 31%, while the S&P 500 as a whole is up nearly 60%. Weak gasoline and petrochemical margins along with record U.S. crude production have weighed on refiners and integrated oil companies this year, yet fund managers and analysts say that energy stocks must also jump the high hurdle of negative investor sentiment before they can catch up to or even lead the broad market higher.  “There’s still an overhang from investors feeling like they have been burned in this cycle before,” said Trip Rodgers, a portfolio manager of the Hennessy BP Energy fund. “There’s only so many times you can get caught off-guard before you start to feel skeptical that higher prices are here to stay.”  That sense of trepidation on the part of investors has helped extend the disconnect between the price of oil and the performance of energy stocks, he said.  Oil prices are up by more than 35% since the start of the year, due in part to higher-than-expected global demand, production cuts from OPEC and the effect of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. Economists expect the price of both Brent crude and U.S. light crude to stay above $60 for the rest of this year, according to the latest Reuters poll.  Yet energy companies continue to lag the broader market, with the S&P 500 energy sector down 3.6% since the start of the quarter. The S&P 500 is up nearly 3% over the same time, and notched a new record high on Wednesday.  Investors will need to see consistent oil prices above $60 a barrel and more “capital discipline” on the part of energy companies before they start to move back into the sector, Rogers said. As a result, he has been focusing on companies that are improving their balance sheets and keeping their costs low despite the gain in the commodity price, he said. Energy Transfer LP, Diamondback Energy Inc, and Parsley Energy Inc are among his largest positions.  Noah Barrett, an analyst who works on several funds at Janus Henderson Investors, said the outsized gap between the gain in oil prices and the muted performance of energy stocks may help fuel a “catch-up trade” later this year. Yet for that to happen, companies must prove to investors that they can keep a lid on spending, he said.  “Particularly among the larger-cap companies, you’re hearing this message of ‘Trust us, we’re focused on generating free cash flow and giving a portion of that back to shareholders instead of plowing it back into the field,’” Barrett said. “That’s a good message but it’s something they can only say for a quarter or two. Because of the history of this industry, this is something that will take multiple quarters, if not years, for investors to believe.” Overall, institutional investors appear to be taking a slightly more bullish stance on energy stocks than retail investors. Global fund managers have a 3% overweight to the sector, well below the overweights of 10% or more that fund managers held through much of 2017 and 2018, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The growth of alternative energy and the popularity of electronic vehicle makers like Tesla Inc are contributing some to the subdued performances of energy companies, said Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group. Yet those concerns will likely fade if oil prices can sustain these relatively high prices, proving to investors that they will not be once again fall victim to a false rally, he said.  “Energy stocks are still pricing in a risk premium, even though energy prices are ramping up,” he said.

423,RPT-Tesla seen finding ample appetite for its newest convertible bond - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:02 AM / 4 days ago","4 Min Read(Repeats to widen distribution) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc should find no shortage of demand for the $1.35 billion convertible bond the electric carmaker is selling even though the terms it is offering look inferior on paper to a similar deal two years ago, bond investors said Thursday. And Tesla’s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said. Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash. In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price. Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla’s existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years. “With this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don’t have to be successful, they don’t have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,” said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management. The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday. The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday. While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said. On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond’s lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion. “The terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don’t think they’ll have any issue selling,” said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position. Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla’s public float of stock is sold short. “I haven’t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,” Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing. “With convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,” he said. Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the “noise” surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk’s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients. “When we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we’ll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,” he said. Reporting by Kate Duguid

424,Shell pursuing $1 billion exit from Indonesia LNG project: sources - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:03 AM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is moving to sell its stake in Indonesia’s $15 billion Abadi liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, industry and banking sources said, following on from an asset disposal program that has raised more than $30 billion. Shell, the world’s largest buyer and seller of LNG, is raising cash to help pay for its $54 billion purchase of BG Group in 2015 and hopes to raise around $1 billion from the sale of its 35 percent stake in the project, the sources said. Shell’s decision to sell out of the Abadi project in the Masela block, operated by Japanese oil and gas firm Inpex Corp which holds the remaining stake, highlights the difficulty Southeast Asia’s largest economy has in attracting energy investment. Shell, Inpex and an official with Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources all declined to comment.  Construction was due to start in 2018, but in 2016 was delayed until at least 2020 after Indonesian authorities instructed a switch from an offshore to an onshore facility.  Inpex and Shell are now preparing a new Plan of Development for submission this year, Shell’s annual report revealed.  The project is not expected to be operational until at least 2026, but Inpex has started preliminary front end engineering design for an LNG plant with an annual capacity of 9.5 million tonnes. Dwi Soetjipto, chairman of Indonesian oil and gas task force SKK Migas, said in March that the government and the operators have not agreed on the cost for the project and the government has not approved the revised development plan. Shell sees LNG as a central pillar of the world’s transition to lower carbon energy in the coming decades. The super-chilled fuel allows easier transportation of natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, but is relatively expensive to develop. The decision to sell out of Abadi comes weeks after the Anglo-Dutch company decided to exit a major Baltics LNG project led by Russian state gas giant Gazprom. Shell last year gave the green light for the development of a $31 billion LNG export terminal in Western Canada, known as LNG Canada. Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said on Thursday that overall Shell was happy with its LNG portfolio and was confident of its ability to grow it in line with the market.

427,UPDATE 1-Euro zone inflation jumps beyond expectations in April - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:37 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min Read(Adds detail, ECB angle, analyst) BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation surged beyond expectations last month, mild relief for the European Central Bank, even if much of the jump was likely related to seasonal effects due to the timing of Easter. Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 1.7 percent in April from 1.4 percent a month ago, beating expectations for 1.6 percent, Eurostat data showed on Friday. More crucially, underlying prices excluding food and energy, a figure closely watched by the ECB, picked up to 1.3 percent from 1 percent, erasing a worrisome dip a month earlier and hitting its highest rate since October on a jump in services costs. The ECB targets inflation just below 2 percent but has undershot this for the past six years even as it deployed an arsenal of conventional and unconventional tools to boost growth and prices. But any relief from solid April figures is likely to be short lived as the ECB expects inflation to slowly sink this year and not hit its target over the next three years. “We don’t think that the ECB will read too much into this print,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. “As before, it will probably want to look through the Easter-related volatility in the core metric, which remains low when stripping out these effects.” Indeed, the ECB has already announced plans to provide even more stimulus through a new round of ultra cheap loans to banks to help the economy, backtracking on earlier plans to normalise policy after years of extraordinary help. It now expects interest rates to stay steady through the year but risks are skewed towards an even later lift-off as markets price no hike for the better part of the next two years. The problem is that growth is faltering, mostly as Germany, the bloc’s powerhouse, struggles through an unexpected dip caused by weak export demand for its manufactured goods. German growth could fall to just 0.5 percent this year, the Bundesbank said on Friday, less than half of the euro zone’s rate, and there was no sign yet of a recovery taking hold. Still, policymakers agree that weakness is merely a dip, not the start of a recession, and a recovery is likely coming in the second half of the year. Supporting their argument, employment continues to rise and services remain robust, suggesting that weak external demand, partly caused by global trade tensions, were the chief culprit of the slowdown. Separately, Eurostat said euro zone prices at factory gates eased 0.1 percent month-on-month in March for a 2.9 percent year-on-year rise, falling short of market expectations of a 0.0 percent monthly reading and a 3.0 percent annual gain. Changes in producer prices are an early indication of trends in consumer prices, because unless they tends to be passed on by retailers and intermediaries to consumes.

428,EU leaders set to meet just after EU election -officials - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:27 AM / 4 days ago","2 Min ReadBRUSSELS, May 3 (Reuters) - National leaders of the European Union are likely to meet for a summit in Brussels on May 28, two days after a European Parliament election, to discuss who should run the EU executive for the next five years, officials said on Friday. The meeting, similar to one held after the previous vote in 2014, would give leaders a chance to discuss their preferences for who will succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission, three senior EU officials told Reuters. Parliament, which will convene on July 2 after being elected on May 23-26, is pushing the European Council of national leaders to nominate Juncker’s successor from among the lead candidates of winning parties. But many national leaders are reluctant to accept this so-called Spitzenkandidat process. Council President Donald Tusk is likely to announce plans for the special summit during a gathering of leaders in Sibiu, Romania next Thursday. They are due formally to nominate a Commission chief at a Brussels summit on June 20-21. The nominee would then require endorsement by the European Parliament.

430,U.S. Senate confirms Abizaid as ambassador to Saudi Arabia - Reuters,"April 10, 2019 /  5:24 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to confirm retired General John Abizaid as the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, filling a vital position vacant since President Donald Trump took office more than two years ago. The Senate voted 92 to seven for the 68-year-old retired four-star Army general, who led U.S. Central Command during the Iraq war. Washington has not had an ambassador in Riyadh since January 2017, a 27-month period in which U.S.-Saudi ties have become increasingly complicated over issues including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Many in Washington have called for a tougher stance against the Saudis on matters such as the imprisonment and alleged torture of women’s rights activists and other dissidents, and the killings of civilians by aircraft from the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen War. Trump nominated Abizaid for the position in November 2018. Despite intense criticism of Saudi Arabia from his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, Trump has expressed reluctance to push too hard on Riyadh. He cites its multibillion-dollar purchases of U.S. military equipment and investments in U.S. firms, as well as its role as an important regional counterbalance to Iran, arch-rival of U.S. ally Israel.

432,"Moore 'superbly underqualified' for Fed, vice chair of joint congressional committee says - Reuters","April 9, 2019 /  6:48 PM / a month ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Stephen Moore, the economic commentator whom President Donald Trump plans to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board, lacks the expertise and political independence needed to help set interest rates for the U.S. economy, a top Congressional Democrat said on Tuesday. “Mr. Moore is superbly underqualified for the role for which he has been nominated,” Representative Carolyn Maloney, vice chair of the Joint Economic Committee, wrote in a letter to Republican Senator Mike Crapo and Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Senate banking committee. Maloney cited Moore’s “out of the mainstream views,” including support for the gold standard, and “his record of partisan statements that casts doubt on his ability to serve independently as a member of the central bank.” Moore “in no way” fits the description of a data-driven policy expert whom Maloney said is needed at the Fed to guide the economy. The two-page letter, which includes a list of citations, ups the political pressure around Moore’s nomination, even before his name has been officially submitted to the Senate for approval as a nominee.  Moore is currently undergoing background checks for the post, a process he described on Monday as about as pleasant as a colonoscopy.  Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed for raising rates, and his pick of Moore and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain for two vacant seats on the Fed Board of Governors have been framed by critics as a means for him to put pressure on the central bank to ease policy and help him politically. Maloney took up this theme in her letter, saying that Moore has a track record of changing his policy recommendations based on his support for the president and his party.  ""Letting someone with Mr. Moore’s track record take part in monetary policy decisions would threaten this independence and credibility of the Federal Reserve in its pursuit of stable prices and full employment,"" she wrote bit.ly/2Z3MHlI. Members of the Fed’s Board are permanent voters on the U.S. central bank’s policy-setting committee, along with the head of the New York Fed. The presidents of the 11 other regional Federal Reserve banks serve as voting members on a rotating basis.  Moore would not be the first economist without a doctoral degree at the Fed, whose current chair, Jerome Powell, is a lawyer with no academic background in economics. But Moore’s views on monetary policy, including his support for a rate cut, distinguish him from every other current Fed policymaker. In a radio interview on Monday, Moore said, “I want to be able to accommodate these growth policies that Trump has put in place that have created the best economy in the world, probably.” Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

433,U.S. job growth surges; unemployment rate falls to 3.6 percent - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:42 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to solid economic growth. The Labour Department’s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday, however, showed steady wage gains last month, consistent with moderate inflation. The decline in the unemployment rate was because people left the labour force, suggesting some slack in the jobs market remains. The report was broadly supportive of the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the economy and job growth as “a bit stronger than we anticipated” and inflation “somewhat weaker.”  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 263,000 jobs last month, amid gains in hiring nearly across all sectors. Data for February and March was revised up to show 16,000 more jobs created than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rising by 185,000 jobs last month. Job growth is well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The second month of strong job growth was further evidence that February’s paltry 56,000 increase in jobs was an aberration. It also effectively put to rest concerns about a recession and diminish expectations of an interest rate cut this year that had been fanned by a brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March. Job growth remains strong, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries, suggesting some slack still remains in the labour market. Steadily rising wages have on balance been keeping workers in the labour force and drawing back those who had dropped out. Average hourly earnings rose six cents, or 0.2 percent in April after rising by the same margin in March. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.2 percent. Though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation, it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut wanes. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualised rate in the first quarter, driven by a surge in exports and inventories, quickening from the October-December period’s 2.2 percent pace. The two-tenths of a percentage point decline in the unemployment rate from 3.8 percent in March was because 490,000 people left the labour force in April. The jobless rate is now below the 3.7 percent that Fed officials project it will be by the end of the year. The labour force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8 percent in April from 63.0 percent in March. The participation rate hit a more than five-year high of 63.2 percent in January. The low participation rate suggests some slack still remains in the labour market. Some economists expect job growth to slow this year as fewer workers become available, which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the Fed’s 2 percent target. An inflation measure tracked by the U.S. central bank increased 1.6 percent in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months, from 1.7 percent in February. Employment at construction sites increased by 33,000 jobs in April, rising for a second straight month. Manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4,000 jobs after being unchanged in March. The industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang. Government payrolls increased by 27,000 in April, likely driven by early hiring for the 2020 Census.

434,Accounting body proposes temporary relief during Libor phase out - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:01 AM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadLONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - A global accounting standard setter has proposed a fast-track temporary fix to help banks and businesses manage Libor-based contracts worth $400 trillion during the transition to alternative interest rate benchmarks. Regulators have set a December 2021 deadline for effectively ending the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate after banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig the benchmark. But uncertainty over how to treat outstanding Libor-based contracts for accounting purposes is threatening a smooth transition to new rates. Companies and banks buy Libor-based contracts to hedge or shield themselves against unexpected moves in interest rates hitting their bottom line, but the current accounting complexity may put them off hedging risks. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), whose book-keeping norms are mandatory in over 100 countries, including the European Union, said on Friday it was proposing to change the wording of its rule on hedge accounting. The existing IASB rule requires assessment of future cash flows from the contracts, something difficult to calculate given the lack of clarity on which interest rate will be referenced later on in a contract that can span years. “This proposal is saying that you can assume your cash flows will be unchanged as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform and that it’s business as usual,” said Sue Lloyd, vice chair of the IASB. The proposal is being put out to public consultation with the amendment due later in 2019. “Once we have clarity about what the new rates are, then we will assess if further changes to our standards are needed. This is just dealing with issues before contracts get changed,” Lloyd said. JPMorgan said in a note to clients this week that phasing out the use of Libor was arguably the biggest challenge facing global finance. “Embedded in the plumbing of markets for more than three decades, the benchmark is rooted in everything from consumer contracts to $190 trillion of U.S. dollar interest rate derivatives,” the bank said. The Federal Reserve and Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority last month urged users of Libor to speed up the switch to alternative rates. The shift is gathering pace in the derivatives market but for cash contracts like loans, there is already talk among participants that a delay to the end of 2021 deadline is inevitable. The aim is to whittle down the number of outstanding contracts using Libor to the smallest number possible by the end of 2021.

436,Tesla ends 'Spartan diet' and seeks $2.3 billion to fund expansion - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  11:18 AM / 4 days ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Tesla Inc will raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital, renouncing what Elon Musk called a “Spartan diet” and easing Wall Street concerns about the money-losing company’s ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla’s plan to issue shares and convertible debt comes after the company repeatedly pushed back forecasts for turning a profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck. Many analysts had calculated that Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter - would not be able to carry out its growth plans without new cash. “The market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief. Now they need to get back to work, and start selling more cars,” said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin. Shares of Tesla rose 4.3 percent to close at $244.10, while the yield on Tesla’s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month. “This is how they pay for the factory in China, the Model Y, their 2020 goals, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.  Raising $650 million in new shares and $1.35 billion in debt, while giving underwriters the option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, could potentially raise the proceeds to $2.3 billion.  Tesla later priced its stock offering at $243 per share and also increased its size to 3.1 million shares from 2.7 million shares, Bloomberg reported after market hours on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  This stock offering price would be at a discount of 0.5 percent to the close on Thursday. Tesla was not immediately available to comment on the report. Chief Executive Officer Musk would also pitch in $10 million of his own money, Tesla said in a filing. For over a year, Musk had insisted that the money-losing Silicon Valley automaker had no need for a capital raise, saying that high Model 3 volume and efficiency would push the company to profit in all quarters of 2019. That changed with a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and warnings that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year. Raising capital should not be a substitute for operating effectively, Musk said last month, suggesting that a capital raise could be near. “It’s healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while,” he said. Before Tesla’s announcement on Thursday, however, analysts speculating about a capital raise had cautioned that the company had missed optimal timing - last year’s third quarter, when the company posted a profit.  Tesla has reported four profitable quarters since it went public in June 2010. The company has made a series of moves to rework pricing strategies for its cars following the reduction of a $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla buyers by half, a decline that hurt first-quarter deliveries.  Musk also has been distracted by a public feud with U.S. regulators. Shares in the company have dropped 28% since the beginning of the year.  Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash. In 2019, it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for 2020 and 2021. Throughout its history, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, equity sales, convertible notes, a junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes. Convertible bonds, which permit an issuer to repay creditors in new stock rather than cash if certain conditions are met, have been among Tesla’s most preferred vehicles for raising capital. They typically allow a borrower to raise capital at a lower interest rate than an ordinary bond because the investor has the potential for a greater return should the conversion terms be met. The convertible notes announced on Thursday are seen carrying a coupon rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal. The convert is being marketed with a higher conversion premium than its last convertible bond, issued in March 2017, meaning Tesla shares will have to rise by an even larger magnitude to trigger a conversion to equity.  Tesla’s last convert was a $977.5-million security maturing in March 2022 that featured a 2.375% coupon with a 25% conversion premium to the stock’s reference price of $262 per share at the time of the sale. That bond can be converted to equity at a price of $327.50 per share, which is currently around 36% above Tesla’s current share price of around $240. In March, Tesla had to repay a $920 million convertible in cash because the stock failed to reach the conversion price of around $360 per share. Only one of the convertibles it or its Solar City unit have issued has met the terms for conversion. The yield on Tesla’s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month at just over 8 percent on Thursday after the news, roughly 2.7 percentage points above its 5.3% coupon. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will manage the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are the additional book-running managers. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have $507 million in outstanding personal loans to Musk, with his Tesla shares put up as collateral, according to Thursday’s prospectus. If Tesla’s stock falls, the banks could force him to sell some of those shares. Tesla’s previous prospectus in 2017 showed Musk had $624 million in personal loans from banks, backed by his shares.  In a sign of Wall Street’s concern about Tesla, Goldman Sachs recommended selling Tesla shares in an April 25 report, putting a 12-month price target of $200.

Tesla, a major minerals consumer, saw shortages of nickel, copper and other electric-vehicle battery minerals down the road due to under-investment in the mining sector, its global supply manager for battery metals told a conference on Thursday. Three-month copper rose 0.2 percent to $6,177.50 a tonne at 0204 GMT, rebounding from a two-and-a-half-month low hit in the previous session.

439,"Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway, finally, has invested in Amazon.com: CNBC - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  12:15 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant Amazon.com Inc for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying, CNBC reported on Thursday. Buffett said the purchase was made by one of his investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, and details would be disclosed later this month in Berkshire’s quarterly report of its U.S. stock holdings. The purchase marks a U-turn for Berkshire, where Buffett has long praised the leadership of Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. “Yeah, I’ve been a fan, and I’ve been an idiot for not buying,” Buffett told CNBC. Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a similar request. Shares of companies often rise when Berkshire reveals its support through new stakes, even when the purchases are believed or known to have been made by Combs or Weschler, who together invest about $26 billion. The initial impetus of the portfolio managers has in the past heralded Buffett’s eventual forays into some of their investments, often in big ways. It was Combs who in 2012 began investing in industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Four years later, Berkshire completed its purchase of that company for $32 billion, in what remains Buffett’s largest acquisition. More recently, it was either Combs or Weschler who in 2016 began investing in iPhone maker Apple Inc. But it was Buffett who ramped up that stake into Berkshire’s largest common stock investment, more than 255 million shares, now worth roughly $53 billion. The Amazon purchase adds an additional bond between Buffett and Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co to form a new venture, Haven, to reduce employee healthcare costs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive. In February, Buffett called acquisition prices “sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.” Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will on Saturday answer shareholder questions at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which normally draws more than 40,000 people.

440,GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian markets calm as investors await U.S. jobs report - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:07 AM / in 5 days","4 Min Read* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Australian shares slightly up, NZ and South Korea weaker * Trading light as China and Japan markets still on holidays * Oil prices near one-month low on fears of supply glut * Aussie, kiwi top movers in FX markets on rate cut talk By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, May 3 (Reuters) - Asian share markets were subdued on Friday amid thin holiday trade although the dollar found support as investors pared expectations for a U.S. rate cut this year while oil prices loitered near one-month lows on oversupply fears. Australia’s benchmark index was last up 0.2 percent, New Zealand shares were off 0.5 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.3 percent. Trading volumes were light across Asia with markets in China and Japan still closed for holidays. Overnight on Wall Street, major indices gave up initial gains and closed in the red, weighed down by energy shares. World stocks have rallied hard this year - the S&P 500 has climbed more than 16 percent so far in 2019 - but further gains will be hard to come by, analysts at Capital Economics said. “We are more downbeat on the outlook for the global economy. We forecast that GDP growth in advanced economies will slow from 2.2 percent in 2018 to just 1.0 percent in 2020,” they said. “As such, we are of the view that investors are still too optimistic about the outlook for earnings growth. As earnings disappoint, we think that stock markets will drop around the world.” Capital Economics forecast the S&P 500 would drop to 2,300 points by Christmas from current levels of just under 2,900. Investors await U.S. employment figures due later in the day, which is forecast to show 185,000 net new jobs were added in April and the unemployment rate steady at 3.8 percent. A solid reading would bolster the notion the world’s biggest economy is on track for its longest expansion ever, further boosting the greenback and prospects for corporate earnings. “There’ll be more than one eye on what the report says about average earnings growth that’s expected to grow a meagre 0.1 percent,” said National Australia Bank economist David de Garis. Global policymakers are grappling with tepid wage growth and lukewarm inflation despite a surge in jobs and still strong economic expansion, complicating monetary policy decision-making. In the currency markets, the biggest movers were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which fell as speculators wagered both countries could see interest cuts next week. The Aussie slipped below psychological support of $0.7000 overnight to the lowest since early January while the kiwi dollar drifted closer to a recent five-month trough of $0.6581. The weakness in the antipodean currencies also came as the U.S. dollar gained on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week that a recent weakness in inflation owed to “transitory” factors. That led traders to start paring the chance of Fed rate cut. Futures now imply about a 49 percent probability of an easing at year-end, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. The dollar index held at 97.814, inching towards a two-year peak of 98.33 touched last week. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was idling at 111.46 having spent the entire week in a tight 111.03-111.89 range. In commodities markets, oil prices fell after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying political crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was flat at $61.81 a barrel while Brent slipped 21 cents to $70.54. Spot gold was marginally higher at $1,271.2 an ounce. Editing by Sam HolmesAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

441,FOREX-Dollar gets yield support into payrolls test - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:20 AM / 5 days ago","4 Min Read* U.S. yields higher as market cools bets on Fed rate cut * Dollar recoups losses to be little changed on week * Market awaits payrolls amid talk of upside risks * AUD, NZD under pressure as rate-cut speculation builds By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 3 (Reuters) - The dollar looked set to end the week with a firmer tone on Friday as markets scaled back bets on a U.S. rate cut, though much depends on what jobs data due later in the session says about the health of the economy and wages. The currency has edged higher since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell played down the recent slowing in inflation and saw no reason to cut interest rates. That helped the dollar index recoup losses from earlier in the week to stand at 97.834 against a basket of currencies , up from a trough of 97.149. It was little changed on the week so far, which was no big surprise given the market has lacked liquidity with Japan and China on holiday. Against the yen, the dollar was idling at 111.46 having spent the entire week in a snug 111.03-111.89 range. The euro was flat at $1.1174, having eased back from a $1.1219 top overnight, though it was still a shade firmer on the week. Eurozone manufacturing surveys out on Thursday showed further contraction in April, but at least got no worse. “The flow of economic data fits with most central banks taking a cautious line, fearful of downside global growth risks,” said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX Strategy at Deutsche Bank. “The USD will be helped by having a pre-existing yield advantage, with a central bank that is trying hard to send a steady policy message.” Interest rate futures imply around a 49 percent chance the Fed would cut rates by December, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday. Yields on two-year Treasuries were also up 6 basis points on the week so far. The pricing on rates may change again depending on what the April jobs report reveals. Forecasts are for payrolls to rise a solid 185,000 with unemployment holding at 3.8 percent. Analysts at NAB reckon there is a chance of an even stronger number given the run of leading indicators and the fact that March was held back by poor weather which cleared in April. They are tipping a rise in jobs of 260,000, which would certainly put a spring in the dollar’s step. The risk for bulls would be a soft wages print given the Fed’s focus on inflation right now. The median forecast is for average earnings growth of 3.3 percent and anything less could take the shine off the dollar. Among the few movers for the week were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which fell as speculators wagered both countries could see interest cuts next week. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds a policy meeting on May 7 and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand a day after and there is a real risk they might ease following recent disappointingly low inflation reports. Futures imply around a 32 percent chance of a quarter point cut form the RBA, while swaps show a 53 percent probability of a move from the RBNZ. The Aussie was down 0.55 percent for the week at $0.6996 , with the kiwi off 0.6 percent. (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The departure of Grady, who was legally supposed to take over from Nielsen after Nielsen’s own ouster earlier this week, was expected after Trump picked U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to become the acting head of the Homeland Security Department.

444,U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico - Reuters,"April 8, 2019 /  9:02 PM / in a month","6 Min Read(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday halted the Trump administration’s policy of sending some asylum seekers back across the southern border to wait out their cases in Mexico, stopping a program the government planned to expand to stem a recent flood of migrants. The ruling is slated to take effect on Friday, according to the order by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. The preliminary injunction will apply nationwide. In a late night tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump said, “A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants. So unfair to the U.S. OUT OF CONTROL!” The program was launched in January and was one of many policies aimed at slowing rising numbers of immigrants arriving at the border, many of them families from Central America, that swelled last month to the highest in a decade. Because of limits on how long children are legally allowed to be held in detention, many of the families are released to await U.S. immigration court hearings, a process that can take years because of ballooning backlogs.  The Trump administration said last week it planned to expand the program of sending some migrants to wait out their U.S. court dates in Mexican border cities under a policy known as Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP. The government argued MPP was needed because so many asylum seekers spend years living in the United States and never appear for their court hearings before their claim is denied and an immigration judge orders them to be deported.  Seeborg said the Immigration and Nationalization Act, however, does not authorize the government to return asylum seekers to Mexico the way the government has applied it.  He also said the policy lacks safeguards to protect refugees from threats to their life or freedom. Justice Department data show that while the percentage of immigration court cases completed “in absentia” - when the foreign citizen fails to show - has risen in recent years, the majority of immigrants show up for their hearings.      A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment on Monday’s ruling. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Mexican foreign ministry considers the ruling “an internal decision” of the United States, a spokesman said. Seeborg said the government shall permit the 11 plaintiffs in the case to enter the United States beginning on Sunday. He said the government still retained the right to detain the asylum-seekers pending the outcome of their case. The ruling can be appealed, and the government could seek a stay of the injunction until the appeals process runs its course.  Still, lawyers for migrants were gratified by the decision. “This is a great ruling,” said Judy Rabinovitz, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which was one of the groups that brought the case.  “This is what they were planning on implementing on a large scale. That would have been a complete game changer in the way our asylum system works,” she said. Rabinovitz said the groups that brought the lawsuit needed to discuss what could be done for the hundreds of refugees who are awaiting their cases in Mexico.  She said as their cases are heard, they will be returned to the United States, but that could take months. The plaintiffs include legal service organizations and migrants who fled Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to escape what they said was extreme violence, rape and death threats. Gabriela Orellana, 26, an asylum seeker from El Salvador who was scheduled to have her first hearing on Tuesday, was delighted by news of the judge’s ruling. “I’m crying from happiness,” she told Reuters. She is not one of the plaintiffs in the case. Orellana said she fled El Salvador with her 8-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son after she was shot by a gang member. She has been in Tijuana since January and has waited nearly two months for her first interview with U.S. immigration authorities. Others in Tijuana were more cautious. “Will I be allowed to go or do I have to stay?” asked Veronica Galdamez, who said she fled San Salvador in 2018 after gang members stole her food cart and, pointing a gun at her, told her she had 24 hours to get out of the city. “I feel real happiness, but also uncertainty, because I don’t know if this applies to me,” Galdamez said. MPP was based on a decades-old law that says migrants who enter from a contiguous country can be returned there to wait out their deportation case, although the provision had never been used in the way the administration has applied it. Civil rights groups sued, arguing the policy violated U.S. and international law by returning refugees to dangerous border towns where they would be unable to get legal counsel or notices of hearings. Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as Secretary of Homeland Security, the department that oversees immigration, on Sunday. A congressional official familiar with the matter said some in Congress believe Trump forced out Nielsen in part because she was trying to obey laws on treatment of refugees, granting of amnesty and separation of families.

445,U.S. lawmakers introduce bill to protect Native American site from drilling - Reuters,"April 9, 2019 /  9:03 PM / a month ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - New Mexico lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill to protect federal lands around the Chaco Canyon from drilling and mining, attempting to permanently shield the Native American cultural site from recurring attempts at oil and gas leasing. U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich and U.S. Representatives Ben Ray Luján and Deb Haaland introduced the Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act, which would bar any future leasing or development of minerals owned by the U.S. government located within a 10-mile protected radius of the area. The federal Bureau of Land Management had deferred a planned lease sale of around 1,500 acres within 10 miles of the park in February after strong public opposition. It was the third attempt by the administration to offer those lands for leasing. “Even as archaeologists are making exciting new discoveries about this region – and even as Tribes and the American public speak out in overwhelming support of protecting this precious landscape – Chaco is being threatened by expanding energy development, including recently proposed leasing inside this long-standing buffer zone,” Udall said in a statement. Heinrich questioned Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose confirmation vote is expected this week, about the future of Chaco Canyon in his confirmation hearing late last month. Bernhardt did not say if he supported a withdrawal but said he “would like to get out there and see the site for myself.” Heinrich, a member of the Senate energy committee, voted to support Bernhardt’s confirmation because he promised to visit the site. The Navajo Nation, as well as the All Pueblo Council of Governors (APCG) backed the legislation, which they said would protect sacred sites from development and environmental destruction. “This land is a part of our histories as tribal nations, and holds life-affirming resources that many of our Pueblos still remember and use,” said All Pueblo Council of Governors Chairman E. Paul Torres. “Once these areas are developed, they are gone forever.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by James DalgleishAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

446,Italy's bond yields set for biggest weekly fall in six weeks - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:16 AM / in 4 days","3 Min Read* Italy set for biggest weekly fall in yields in 6 wks * Spain 10-year bond yield close to lowest since 2016 * EZ flash CPI, US NFP due out * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Italian bond yields were set for their biggest weekly falls in six weeks on Friday and Spanish yields hovered close to their lowest levels since late 2016, reflecting a pick up in appetite for southern European bond markets. In early trade, benchmark 10-year bond yields across the euro area were little changed with focus on flash inflation numbers for the bloc and key U.S. jobs data later this session. As the week draws to a close, it was the move in southern European bonds that stood out. Relief that S&P Global kept Italy’s ratings unchanged and Sunday’s election in Spain past without any major upsets, sparked a fall in bonds yields and rise in prices at the start of the week. That move gathered pace as data lifted hopes of a recovery for regional economies: the Spanish manufacturing sector for instance expanded in April at its fastest rate since January, data showed on Thursday. “Near-term, this dynamic (in the periphery) looks set to extend,” said Christoph Rieger, head of rates at Commerzbank. “This week’s GDP data was better than expected and PMIs show improvements in the periphery while Germany has faltered.” Italy’s 10-year bond yield was marginally higher at 2.55 percent, near over two-week lows hit the previous session. It is down 2.5 basis points on the week, which would mark its biggest weekly fall in six weeks. Spain’s 10-year bond yield was flat on the day at around 1 percent, having hits its lowest since late 2016 on Thursday at around 0.97 percent. It has fallen 2.5 bps this week, while German Bund yields have risen almost 5 bps. That has left the Spanish/German bond yield gap at around 95 bps, its tightest in around seven months. James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, said he was bullish on Spain long-term and started selling German Bunds last week. “In Europe, we’re long Spain versus Germany and France,” he said. “With that you get the best-performing economy of the majors in the euro zone and we’re past the event risk of the election.” Other analysts noted big flows into peripheral bonds this week, which they suspected was cross-asset investors shifting funds from equity to fixed income markets. Focus turned to April euro zone inflation data, with a pick up in consumer prices anticipated following solid data from Germany earlier this week. Economists expect annual euro zone inflation to accelerate to 1.6 percent in April from 1.4 percent in March. Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by

Against the yen, the dollar was idling at 111.48 having spent the entire week in a snug 111.03-111.89 band. The euro was flat at $1.1172, having eased back from a $1.1219 top overnight, though it was still a shade firmer on the week. Eurozone manufacturing surveys released on Thursday showed further contraction in April, but at least got no worse. “The flow of economic data fits with most central banks taking a cautious line, fearful of downside global growth risks,” said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX strategy at Deutsche Bank. “The USD will be helped by having a pre-existing yield advantage, with a central bank that is trying hard to send a steady policy message.” Interest rate futures imply around a 49 percent chance the Fed would cut rates by December, down from 61 percent late on Wednesday. Yields on two-year Treasuries were up 6 basis points on the week so far. The pricing on rates may change again depending on what the U.S. April jobs report reveals. Forecasts are for payrolls to rise a solid 185,000 with unemployment at 3.8 percent. Analysts at NAB reckon there is a chance of an even stronger number, given the run of leading indicators and the fact that March was held back by poor weather that cleared in April. They are tipping a rise in jobs of 260,000, which would certainly put a spring in the dollar’s step. The risk for bulls would be a soft wages print, given the Fed’s focus on inflation right now. The median forecast is for average earnings growth of 3.3 percent and anything less could take the shine off the dollar. Among the few movers for the week were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which fell as speculators wagered both countries could see interest cuts next week. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds a policy meeting on May 7 and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand a day after, and there is a real risk they might ease following recent disappointingly low inflation reports. Futures imply around a 32 percent chance of a quarter point cut from the RBA, while swaps show a 53 percent probability of a move from the RBNZ. The Aussie was down 0.5 percent for the week at $0.6996 , with the kiwi also off 0.5 percent at $0.6622.

454,U.S. senators introduce bill to sanction Turkish officials over detentions - Reuters,"April 9, 2019 /  11:13 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Tuesday introduced a bipartisan bill requiring the imposition of sanctions on Turkish officials responsible for the detentions of U.S. citizens and local consulate staff in Turkey, a statement on the legislation said. The bill, introduced by Republican Senator Roger Wicker and Democrat Ben Cardin, also calls on President Donald Trump to urge Turkey to respect for the fundamental freedoms, saying thousands were victims of politically-motivated prosecution. “The Turkish government’s false imprisonment of Americans and Turkish citizens employed by the United States in Turkey is a gross violation of their human rights,” Senator Cardin said in the statement. “Our bill makes clear that the United States will not tolerate years of Turkish recalcitrance on these cases.” The detention of U.S. consulate workers and American citizens is one of many issues dividing NATO allies Ankara and Washington, also at loggerheads over Syria policy and Turkey’s planned purchase of Russian missile defenses. Their detentions prompted Washington in October 2017 to suspend all non-immigrant visa applications from the country, triggering a reciprocal move from Ankara that contributed to a deep crisis in bilateral ties. The bill introduced Tuesday would require the U.S. administration to impose sanctions on all senior Turkish officials responsible for the “wrongful” detentions of U.S. citizens and staff, including barring the officials from travel to the United States and freezing any U.S. assets. Turkey has detained tens of thousands of people following a failed coup in July 2016, saying they were linked with the network of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Islamic cleric blamed by Ankara for orchestrating the putsch. U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson was among those jailed in the aftermath of the coup. He was released last October. “While the Turkish government made a step in the right direction with the release of Pastor Andrew Brunson last October, more needs to be done for Turkey to show good faith and act like a NATO ally,” said Republican Senator Thom Tillis, one of six original sponsors of Tuesday’s bill. Serkan Golge, a dual Turkish-U.S. citizen, was found guilty of being a member of an armed terrorist organization earlier this year and sentenced to seven years, six months in prison. Three other Turkish citizens who were working at the U.S. consulates in Turkey have been under investigation or jailed over similar charges. A Turkish court last month ruled that one of the consular workers, Metin Topuz, a translator and fixer in Istanbul, should remain in jail until his trial resumes in June.

455,Senate panel chair rejects Trump request for State Department budget cut - Reuters,"April 9, 2019 /  7:25 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham flatly rejected on Tuesday President Donald Trump’s request to slash the budget for the U.S. State Department by more than 23 percent. That proposal “ain’t happening,” Graham, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the State Department, declared at the opening of the hearing with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Senator Patrick Leahy, the top subcommittee Democrat, said the administration has proposed “damaging funding cuts, with little to no logical explanation.” The Trump administration requested about $40 billion to fund the State Department and its aid arm, the United States Agency for International Development, for the fiscal year starting in October. Pompeo noted the hearing comes days before his first anniversary as Trump’s second secretary of state. Graham joked that Pompeo was the longest-serving member of Trump’s cabinet, referring to the high turnover of senior-level staff at the White House. Pompeo smiled but did not reply.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stepped down this week in the latest high-profile resignation, and Trump said on Monday he would replace the head of the U.S. Secret Service. Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives have also said they will reject the proposed cuts to the budget, setting the stage for a budget battle with the White House.

456,U.S. Senate Republican leader calls net neutrality bill 'dead on arrival' - Reuters,"April 9, 2019 /  6:36 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday a Democratic bid to restore the 2015 net neutrality rules is “dead on arrival in the Senate.” The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday debated a Democratic plan to reinstate the Obama-era rules and overturn a December 2017 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to reverse the rules and hand sweeping authority to internet providers to recast how Americans access information. Late Tuesday, the House opted to delay a vote on the measure and a series of amendments until Wednesday because of an unrelated issue over a separate budget measure. The net neutrality bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC’s order, approved on a 3-2 vote, that repealed rules barring providers from blocking or slowing internet content or offering paid “fast lanes.” The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers such as Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, but was opposed by companies like Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc. On Monday, the White House told Congress that if the bill were approved, President Donald Trump’s advisers would recommend he veto it. The White House “strongly opposes” the measure that would “return to the heavy-handed regulatory approach of the previous administration,” it said in a statement. The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order. The House will also consider a series of amendments. Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat, said Tuesday the bill “puts a cop on the beat to make sure our internet service providers aren’t acting in an unjust, unreasonable or discriminatory way.” Republicans called a bid to restore internet protections akin to a “government takeover of the internet” and said it would open the door to the FCC eventually setting internet rates or imposing new taxes on internet service similar to levies on cable or telephone service. Democrats say polls show Americans overwhelmingly back net neutrality and want protections that providers will not interfere with their internet access.

458,Biotech crops among sticking points in U.S.-China trade deal: sources - Reuters,"April 5, 2019 /  12:45 AM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - China’s lengthy approval process for genetically modified crops remains a sticking point in talks to end the trade war between China and the United States, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. Beijing has taken years to approve new strains of GM crops, which U.S. companies and farmers have complained stalls trade by restricting the sales of new products from companies such as DowDuPont Inc, Bayer AG, and Syngenta AG.  The issue is one of a host of U.S. complaints that the administration of President Donald Trump is demanding China address if it wants to end trade disputes that have cost both countries billions of dollars and slowed the global economy. Trump on Thursday said the two sides were getting very close to a deal that could be announced in about four weeks, though there were still differences to be bridged. GM crops and the approval process are still a “big issue” in the discussions, said one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The issue has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, the bulk of which are genetically modified. If it does not approve new strains, then farmers in the United States  cannot plant them because China may reject shipments that include them. Seed companies cannot fully commercialize sales of new strains without those approvals. The two sides had appeared to make some progress on the issue in January, when China approved a handful of GMO crops for import. They were the first in about 18 months. The move did not address the core U.S. concerns over delays to the process. A spokeswoman from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, who is leading the Washington team in the discussions, did not respond immediately to request for confirmation or comment. China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not immediately respond to faxed questions on Friday, which was a public holiday in China. It is unclear what differences on the issue remain. The United States wants China to accelerate its approval process and make it more similar to Washington’s. Beijing allows imports of GMO soybeans and corn for use in animal feed, even though it does not permit planting of them. China bought about 60 percent of U.S. soy exports, worth about $12 billion, before the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and could reject shipments of unapproved varieties. Beijing promised to speed up its review of applications during previous trade talks with the United States in 2017. In the past, Beijing has held back approvals of imported GMO products amid concerns about anti-GMO sentiment in China. The trade deal, should it be agreed, is expected to include a six-year time frame for purchases of more than $1 trillion in U.S. goods, including commodity products.

459,"Putin, on Mueller report: 'We said from the start it would find nothing' - Reuters","April 9, 2019 /  1:58 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadST PETERSBURG/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday commented for the first time on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s completed report into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, saying Moscow had always said it would find nothing. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a summary released last month that Mueller had found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the election. Putin, speaking at an Arctic forum in the Russian city of St Petersburg, said on Friday that Mueller’s findings were predictable for Moscow. “That it (Mueller’s inquiry) would finish in that way - like a mountain giving birth to a mouse as they say - was clear to us in advance. I’ve been telling you this all along.” “We said from the start that this infamous commission of Mr Mueller’s would not find anything because nobody knows this better than us. Russia did not meddle in any elections in the United States. There was no collusion, as Mr Mueller said, between Trump and Russia.”   Putin said the original allegations of collusion were “complete nonsense” that had been invented for domestic U.S. political consumption and as part of what he described as America’s internal political struggle. The U.S. Attorney General told lawmakers on Tuesday that he intends to release the Mueller report to the public within a week. While the Mueller report cleared Trump of colluding with Russia it did not clear Moscow of trying to meddle in the 2016 vote. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia did interfere, with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord. When asked at the same event whether he wanted to see Trump re-elected next year, Putin declined to express a view, citing a long list of disagreements with the Trump administration and saying that the question of Trump’s possible re-election was purely a matter for the American people. But Putin, who has praised Trump in the past, said he hoped Moscow and Washington would be able to work together to try to resolve their many differences on the international stage once what he described as the U.S. political crisis was over. Putin in July last year said he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election because Trump had spoken of wanting to repair U.S.-Russia relations. Overshadowed by the Mueller report and disagreements over everything from Syria to Ukraine, relations between Russia and the United States have in fact got worse under Trump.

462,RPT-COLUMN-Fed rate cut likely if U.S. manufacturing continues to slow: Kemp - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:05 AM / 5 days ago","6 Min Read(Repeats Thursday’s story without changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2WjnsKH By John Kemp LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers reported a further slowdown in growth last month. If the trend continues, it is likely the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the second half of the year as a precaution against recession. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8 in April, down from 55.3 in March and only modestly above the 50-point threshold separating expanding activity from a contraction. The index has been on a downward trend since peaking in August 2018 and has now fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, according to the latest survey results published on Wednesday. In August, the index was in the 90th percentile for all months since 1950, pointing to a very broad-based and rapid expansion. By April, the index had fallen to the 44th percentile, indicating a significant slowdown. Manufacturers report new orders, production and employment are all growing more slowly, while inventories are increasing faster, and supplier deliveries are accelerating, all of which are consistent with slowing growth. The U.S. manufacturing sector typically cycles between periods of faster and slower growth, some of which become end-of-cycle recessions while others become mid-cycle slowdowns followed by renewed expansion. The manufacturing growth cycle is not regular, but it is somewhat predictable, and the acceleration and deceleration of activity is not random. The ISM index follows a fairly consistent oscillation. End-of-cycle recessions almost always prompt the Federal Reserve to cut overnight interest rates and take other steps to boost lending and ease financial conditions (tmsnrt.rs/2WjnsKH). The recession in 1980 was a rare exception, when the Fed raised rather than lowered interest rates, even as the economy slipped into recession, in an effort to reduce inflation. But mid-cycle slowdowns in manufacturing also usually result in a cut in policy-controlled interest rates or other monetary easing as the central bank attempts to fend off the risk of recession. Mid-cycle manufacturing slowdowns centred on April 1967, May 1985, January 1996 and December 1998 all coincided with reductions in the effective federal funds rate. Sometimes the central bank takes other measures rather cutting the federal funds target, for example adding to its portfolio of securities, changing its forward guidance, or easing other credit controls. The slowdown centred on August 1962 prompted the Fed to buy extra U.S. Treasury securities and ease margin requirements to boost lending and offset the sharp reduction in stock market credit (“Annual Report”, 1962). The slowdown centred on November 2012 encouraged the central bank to step up its quantitative easing programme by purchasing additional mortgage-backed securities (“FOMC statement”, September 2012). And the slowdown centred on January 2016 caused the central bank to soften its previous language about raising interest rates and replace it with a more gradual stance (“FOMC statement”, December 2015). Previous mid-cycle slowdowns were all somewhat worse than the current loss of momentum, with the ISM manufacturing index hitting a low to somewhere between 49.5 (the best case in August 1962) and 42.8 (the worst case in April 1967). In more recent decades, the ISM index has hit mid-cycle troughs at 47.1 (May 1985), 45.9 (February 1996), 46.8 (December 1998), 48.9 (November 2012) and 47.8 (January 2016). But if the index continues to decline at its recent rate it will cross the 50-point threshold sometime in the second or third quarter, boosting the probability the Fed will ease financial conditions in the second half of the year. Bond traders certainly think the probability of interest rate reductions or other monetary accommodation is increasing, with the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the second half of 2019 inverting again in recent days. For the time being, the Fed itself “continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the ... 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.” However, acknowledging downside risk, the central bank noted “global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures” and promised to be patient before adjusting rates (“FOMC statement”, May 2019). The recent decline in core measures of inflation would give the central bank scope to ease policy if it decided the risk of recession was rising. Many commentators, policymakers and traders have expressed confidence that the economy will re-accelerate later in the year, given strong growth in household incomes. If a comprehensive trade deal can be reached between the United States and China, that could reduce tariffs, boost business confidence and investment, and spur faster growth. Congress and the administration could also reach an agreement on a major infrastructure spending package that would aim, among other things, to boost domestic manufacturing and employment. Since the 1960s, however, there has never been a mid-cycle slowdown comparable to the current one when the Fed has not taken steps to ease financial conditions. Perhaps this time will be different. But if the slowing trend persists for the next 2-3 months, policymakers may conclude it is worth a small easing of financial conditions as an insurance policy against a recession. The Fed made the same calculation in 2012, 1998, 1995, 1985, 1967 and 1962. Faced with the same set of problems, policymakers are likely to react in the same way again.

463,CORRECTED-UPDATE 7-Tesla ends 'Spartan diet' and seeks $2.3 bln to fund expansion - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  12:08 PM / 5 days ago","6 Min Read(Corrects second paragraph to say Tesla is selling shares and convertible debt, not debt and convertible shares) By Akanksha Rana and Alexandria Sage May 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital, renouncing what Elon Musk called a “Spartan diet” and easing Wall Street concerns about the money-losing company’s ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla’s plan to issue shares and convertible debt comes after the company repeatedly pushed back forecasts for turning a profit. The company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck. Many analysts had calculated that Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter - would not be able to carry out its growth plans without new cash. “The market seems to be breathing a sigh of relief. Now they need to get back to work, and start selling more cars,” said Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin. Shares of Tesla rose 4.3% to close at $244.10, while the yield on Tesla’s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month. “This is how they pay for the factory in China, the Model Y, their 2020 goals, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. Raising $650 million in new shares and $1.35 billion in debt, while giving underwriters the option to buy an additional 15 percent of each offering, could potentially raise the proceeds to $2.3 billion. Chief Executive Officer Musk would also pitch in $10 million of his own money, Tesla said in a filing. For over a year, Musk had insisted that the money-losing Silicon Valley automaker had no need for a capital raise, saying that high Model 3 volume and efficiency would push the company to profit in all quarters of 2019. That changed with a $702 million loss in the first quarter, and warnings that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year. Raising capital should not be a substitute for operating effectively, Musk said last month, suggesting that a capital raise could be near. “It’s healthy to be on a Spartan diet for a while,” he said. Before Tesla’s announcement on Thursday, however, analysts speculating about a capital raise had cautioned that the company had missed optimal timing - last year’s third quarter, when the company posted a profit. Tesla has reported four profitable quarters since it went public in June 2010. The company has made a series of moves to rework pricing strategies for its cars following the reduction of a $7,500 federal tax credit for Tesla buyers by half, a decline that hurt first-quarter deliveries. Musk also has been distracted by a public feud with U.S. regulators. Shares in the company have dropped 28% since the beginning of the year. Tesla ended its first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash. In 2019, it expects capital expenditures of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and about $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually for 2020 and 2021. Throughout its history, Tesla has raised funds through bank loans, equity sales, convertible notes, a junk bond sale, securitization of its vehicle leases and solar asset-backed notes. Convertible bonds, which permit an issuer to repay creditors in new stock rather than cash if certain conditions are met, have been among Tesla’s most preferred vehicles for raising capital. They typically allow a borrower to raise capital at a lower interest rate than an ordinary bond because the investor has the potential for a greater return should the conversion terms be met. The convertible notes announced on Thursday are seen carrying a coupon rate of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal. The convert is being marketed with a higher conversion premium than its last convertible bond, issued in March 2017, meaning Tesla shares will have to rise by an even larger magnitude to trigger a conversion to equity. Tesla’s last convert was a $977.5-million security maturing in March 2022 that featured a 2.375% coupon with a 25% conversion premium to the stock’s reference price of $262 per share at the time of the sale. That bond can be converted to equity at a price of $327.50 per share, which is currently around 36% above Tesla’s current share price of around $240. In March, Tesla had to repay a $920 million convertible in cash because the stock failed to reach the conversion price of around $360 per share. Only one of the convertibles it or its Solar City unit have issued has met the terms for conversion. The yield on Tesla’s existing $1.8 billion junk bond fell to its lowest level in over a month at just over 8 percent on Thursday after the news, roughly 2.7 percentage points above its 5.3% coupon. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup will manage the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Securities, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are the additional book-running managers. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have $507 million in outstanding personal loans to Musk, with his Tesla shares put up as collateral, according to Thursday’s prospectus. If Tesla’s stock falls, the banks could force him to sell some of those shares. Tesla’s previous prospectus in 2017 showed Musk had $624 million in personal loans from banks, backed by his shares. In a sign of Wall Street’s concern about Tesla, Goldman Sachs recommended selling Tesla shares in an April 25 report, putting a 12-month price target of $200.

464,Tesla seen finding ample appetite for its newest convertible bond - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  11:54 PM / 5 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Tesla Inc should find no shortage of demand for the $1.35 billion convertible bond the electric carmaker is selling even though the terms it is offering look inferior on paper to a similar deal two years ago, bond investors said Thursday. And Tesla’s volatile and broadly underperforming stock is one reason why, they said. Convertible securities feature the income and protections of a low-yielding bond but offer the potential to profit far more from a jump in the stock price that triggers repayment in shares rather than cash.  In the new deal, being sold alongside $650 million in new shares, Tesla is looking to offer an interest rate below the coupon on its previous convertible from two years ago, even though interest rates today are broadly higher. There is also a higher bar for taking advantage of the stock price.  Investors, however, said the new deal in fact looks appealing when compared with Tesla’s existing convertibles, which now feature even leaner yields and, because the stock has been so wobbly, an even lower chance at striking a rich equity conversion before those bonds mature in the next three years. “With this new bond, you have five years until the bond is supposed to pay off. They don’t have to be successful, they don’t have to hit a home run. They just have to stay in business to refinance this in five years,” said Geoffrey Dancey, managing partner and portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management.      The fundraising - which could top $2 billion in total - is easing Wall Street concerns about the carmaker, which has struggled to maintain profitability, and its ability to overcome a drop in sales and build new product lines. Tesla shares, which had fallen by nearly 10% in the two years since its last convertible was sold, ended more than 4% higher on Thursday. The new convertible bond is seen carrying a coupon of between 1.5% and 2.0% with a conversion premium of between 27.5% and 32.5% over the reference price for Tesla shares at the time of the sale, according to a trader who saw preliminary marketing materials for the deal on Thursday.  While those appear to be poorer terms for investors than the 2.375% coupon on the $977.5 million convertible bond maturing in March 2022, it is superior to the current yield to maturity on that 2022 bond at around 1%, Dancey said.  On its face, the conversion premium being touted, with a midpoint at 30%, also compares unfavorably to the 2022 bond’s lower conversion premium of 25%. But the underperformance of the stock, which closed at $244.10 on Thursday, means holders of the 2022 bond need at least a 34% rise in the stock to a price of$327.50 in order to trigger a conversion. “The terms of the convertible look reasonable, and I don’t think they’ll have any issue selling,” said Dancey, who may buy some of the new bonds. He does not have an existing position. Another boost to demand could come from the legion of short sellers of Tesla shares who often buy convertibles as a hedge, a common arbitrage used by hedge funds, said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer at Calamos Investments. More than 25% of Tesla’s public float of stock is sold short.     “I haven’t heard anything that would make me think this would have any trouble getting done,” Pars said. Calamos has positions in convertibles from both Tesla and its solar panel-making unit, Solar City, according to its most recent SEC filing.  “With convertible bonds there are many opportunities for things to turn out OK,” he said.    Ross Gerber, chief executive of investment manager Gerber Kawasaki, known for his bullish positions on Tesla said the “noise” surrounding Tesla - including Chief Executive Elon Musk’s recent court fight with the SEC over his tweets - had rattled some of his clients.   “When we build a portfolio, Tesla will be a part of it. But what we’ll probably be doing is adding more on the convertible side not on the equity side,” he said.

467,Brazil airline Azul could bid for Avianca Brasil's assets after all - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  10:30 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Azul SA has registered to participate in a bankruptcy auction for the assets of struggling carrier Avianca Brasil scheduled for next week, potentially walking back a previous decision not to participate.  The airline confirmed through a representative that they had registered, although he said no decision had been made whether to actually place a bid. The bankruptcy auction is set for Tuesday.   Avianca Brasil filed for bankruptcy in December and will auction some of its most coveted airport slots, which grant airlines the right to operate flights out of crowded airports. Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico first reported Azul’s registration earlier on Thursday.  Avianca Brasil, which is the country’s fourth largest airline, has been so strapped for cash in recent months it has been kept afloat by loans from its competitors, who sought to keep the airline alive until the auction. If Avianca Brasil ceased operations before the auction, it would also lose its slots.  Its fleet has been dwarfed from a high of 60 planes late last year to fewer than 10 in late April.  The auction has caused much tension among Brazil’s top 3 airlines, including Azul.  An initial plan would have had Azul take over the majority of Avianca Brasil’s airport slots in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But a few weeks later, its bigger competitors, LATAM Airlines Group and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes struck a deal with Avianca Brasil’s largest creditor, U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, to create a new plan that would divide up some of those slots among themselves instead.  The shakeup was ill received by Azul, which has loaned Avianca Brasil 51 million reais ($12.86 million) and said in court papers filed on Thursday that the struggling carrier had already defaulted on repaying that debt. This week, Azul said it would leave Brazil aviation industry group Abear, where it was a member along with LATAM and Gol.  LATAM and Gol have also loaned Avianca Brasil tens of millions of dollars and have pledged to bid at least $70 million each at the Tuesday auction.  Avianca Brasil is separate from the better-known Avianca Holdings, which is based in Colombia and is not going through bankruptcy proceedings.

469,U.S. advertising groups create privacy bill coalition - Reuters,"April 8, 2019 /  8:13 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. advertising trade groups have banded together to lobby Congress to ensure federal online privacy legislation is less strict than a law scheduled to go into effect in California in 2020. The issue is of huge concern to advertisers, who rely on online data collection to help ad buyers spend their advertising budgets effectively. Lawmakers in Congress are working on a bill but appear divided on how strong it should be and whether it should pre-empt California’s law. No consensus draft has been introduced. Privacy for America, the group announced on Monday, said  U.S. legislation should prohibit practices like using a person’s data to deny them a job or sharing data with third parties without ensuring there is no fraud intended. They also called on lawmakers to create a Protection Bureau within the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whose job it would be to authorize penalties for companies who break rules covered by the proposed legislation. Their measure would also require strong data security protections to guard against data breaches.     Justin Brookman, a privacy advocate with Consumer Reports and a veteran of the FTC, expressed support for efforts to strengthen the agency but was otherwise unimpressed with the proposal. “They’re picking some already-on-the-ground fruit,” he said.     “It looks like the existing self-regulatory rules that they’ve had in place for years that didn’t work that well.” The new group’s steering committee is composed of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the Association of National Advertisers, Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and Network Advertising Initiative. “We’ve been making the rounds on Capitol Hill and we’ve been met very favorably,” said Randall Rothenberg, CEO of IAB, acknowledging “honestly some tense conversations along the way.” Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet’s Google and Twitter are all members of the IAB. The proposed measure was aimed at pre-empting California’s more stringent law, said Stuart Ingis, an attorney working with the group.  The advertisers also hoped to avoid rules like those adopted by the European Union last year which require consumers to “click” to consent to a website’s data collection practices before using the site, said Ingis.

470,U.S. prosecutors seek leniency for political consultant tied to Russia probe - Reuters,"April 8, 2019 /  7:52 PM / a month ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - A veteran political consultant who pleaded guilty in August in a case spun out of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe should get a lenient sentence to account for his “substantial” assistance in other criminal investigations, U.S. prosecutors said on Monday. Samuel Patten, 47, is a former business partner of Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national accused by Mueller of having ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik was indicted in June. Among other offenses, Patten pleaded guilty to communicating with U.S. lawmakers and the media on behalf of the Opposition Bloc, a Russia-aligned political party in Ukraine, without disclosing that work to the Justice Department, in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Patten had been cooperating with the special counsel’s probe. His case has also sparked interest in Washington amid a widening crackdown by the Justice Department on undisclosed lobbying. Federal prosecutors in Washington, who started investigating Patten after receiving a referral from Mueller, said in a court filing on Monday that Patten met or spoke with government investigators on the phone nine times. He was also willing to serve as a witness in one of two cases against Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, who had also worked for the Opposition Bloc. Manafort ultimately pleaded guilty, obviating the need for a trial.  “Patten has served as a valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations, providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities,” prosecutors wrote in the filing. While the prosecutors did not suggest a specific sentence, they said leniency was warranted given Patten’s assistance. Mueller wrapped up his investigation two weeks ago without establishing a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign. The full Mueller report has not been released to the public yet but is expected in redacted form as early as this week.  While acknowledging he broke the law, Patten argued in his own sentencing memo that his case differed from other FARA violations, which have typically involved a lobbyist attempting to conceal the identity of the client and the source of funds.  “Mr. Patten did not create companies or entities to hide who he was working for or to conceal foreign influence,” Patten’s lawyer wrote in the filing arguing for a sentence of probation. Patten also admitted to arranging for a U.S. citizen to act as a straw purchaser to pay $50,000 for four tickets to the inauguration of President Donald Trump on behalf of a Ukrainian oligarch, who reimbursed Patten through a Cypriot account. The move circumvented U.S. law prohibiting foreigners from providing money to an organization running the inauguration. Patten is due to be sentenced on Friday.

471,Klobuchar raises more than $5 million for U.S. presidential run - Reuters,"April 8, 2019 /  10:02 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5 million during the first seven weeks of her 2020 White House bid, with more than $3 million left over from her Senate campaign, leaving her with total cash on hand of about $7 million, her campaign said on Monday. Klobuchar’s first quarter fundraising total is considerably less than others among the more than 15 Democrats who have announced they are running for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Senator Bernie Sanders leads the pack, raising about $18 million during the first six weeks of his presidential run, his campaign said. Senator Kamala Harris raised $12 million during the first three months of 2019, according to figures released by her campaign.  Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who recently saw a bump in opinion polls but is still considered a long-shot, announced last week that he had raised $7 million during the first quarter. Beto O’Rourke, a former U.S congressman from Texas, raised $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his bid for the presidency, his campaign said. The campaign of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers to focus on grassroots donations, said she hit her first-quarter fundraising goal but has not yet released a figure. Fundraising is an early way to prove to donors and potential supporters that a candidate is viable.  Grassroots fundraising is also one of the qualifying criteria for the Democratic primary debates. Candidates can qualify if they have 65,000 unique donors, along with a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states. Klobuchar’s campaign said the average online grassroots contribution was $40 and that 85 percent of all donors gave less than $100. Presidential candidates are required by law to report all campaign donations. They cannot accept more than $2,800 from a single donor during the primary race. The campaigns’ first quarter fundraising reports are due to the Federal Election Commission by April 15.  Reporting by Amanda Becker; Editing by Tom BrownAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

472,"Moore, under fire, withdraws from bid for Fed post - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  1:09 PM / 5 days ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Economic commentator Stephen Moore has withdrawn from consideration for a seat on the U.S. Federal Reserve Board after weeks of criticism about his political partisanship, shifting views on interest rate policy, and sexist comments about women.  “Steve Moore, a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person, has decided to withdraw from the Fed process,” President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. “Steve won the battle of ideas including Tax Cuts ... and deregulation which have produced non-inflationary prosperity for all Americans. I’ve asked Steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our Country.” Earlier Thursday, Moore had told Bloomberg TV that he was “all in” and that he expected to be nominated within three weeks.  Moore, 59, was picked by Trump in March to fill one of two vacant positions at the Fed, but had not been formally nominated. Trump’s other pick for the Fed, businessman Herman Cain, withdrew from consideration in mid-April after lawmakers expressed discomfort with the sexual harassment allegations that short-circuited Cain’s presidential bid in 2012. Cain has denied those allegations.  Moore, for his part, has said his comments about women were meant as humor. On Thursday, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey agreed, and said he was “inclined to support” Moore’s nomination. But in a letter of resignation and in an interview on Fox Business Network, Moore said the toll the scrutiny was taking on his family made continuing the process untenable. Moore’s sister, Kathy Dodd, told Reuters that while she and his other siblings might not agree with him on everything, the barrage of criticism was searing. “We all feel bad for him ... personally I think he should drop out, I don’t think it’s worth it,” she said in an interview on Wednesday. At the Fed, Moore would have had a permanent vote on setting interest rates for at least five years and as many as 11 years, depending on which of two vacant posts he would have occupied.  Moore’s loyalty to Trump worried some lawmakers, concerned that his partisanship could threaten the Fed’s independence, seen as critical to the U.S. central bank’s ability to conduct policy effectively. Moore has worked with Trump since early in his 2016 campaign for president, and in interviews in recent weeks has tied the U.S. economy’s prospects directly to whether Trump is re-elected. But it was Moore’s history of sexist comments about women, both jokingly and not, that appeared to most hurt his prospects, with Republican senators including Joni Ernst citing those remarks for their opposition to, or at least hesitation over, Moore. In one column that Moore has since apologized for, he joked that women should not referee men’s basketball games and suggested they should not be in military combat. In another in 2014, Moore said that if women were paid more than men, society could be destabilized. Interviews in recent days by Reuters with more than a dozen friends and colleagues, as well as his sister, paint a picture of a strong-minded, ambitious but friendly person with an enduring belief in the power of tax cuts to fuel economic growth and seemingly bottomless energy to devote to promoting that belief.  He also has dramatic flair — his second wedding, where National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow was his best man, took place at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington.  None of the interviews suggested that Moore’s past comments about women translated into any bad behavior.  “He wouldn’t be a good friend of mine if he didn’t (respect women),” said Betsy Hart, who worked with Moore at the conservative Heritage Foundation and has socialized with him regularly since then.   Moore grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, the fourth child of an equipment parts exporter and a housewife. The family played a lot of sports together, including tennis, basketball and whiffle ball, and still do at their annual family gatherings at Christmas, his younger sister Dodd said.   In high school Moore was “kind of a geek,” she said, spending his Fridays and Saturday nights with index cards to prepare for debate team meets.  At college he got turned on to economics by University of Illinois professor Julian Simon, who among other achievements came up with the idea for airlines to overbook flights and pay passengers they end up bumping.  Moore spent years writing editorials for the Wall Street Journal and policy pieces for the libertarian Cato Institute, and has a long track record of supporting Republican causes, chief among them tax cuts. In 1999 he founded the Club for Growth to raise money for like-minded politicians, and ran it until 2004.   Over the years, Moore said less about monetary policy than fiscal policy, and his views have been less consistent. As recently as September 2015 he called for eliminating the U.S. central bank and removing then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen, who he said was keeping money too easy.  More recently, Moore called for the firing of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank raised interest rates in December and, like Trump, he has called for rate cuts this year. Democrats hailed his withdrawal. “The only thing less funny than some of Mr. Moore’s tasteless, offensive, sexist ‘jokes’ was the idea that President Trump would even consider him for a seat on the Federal Reserve,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in upper chamber.

474,U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds see 14th week of inflows - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  8:10 PM / 5 days ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Investors gravitated toward the higher-quality spectrum of the credit markets this week, as U.S.-based investment-grade corporate bond funds attracted about $374.5 million in net cash, their 14th consecutive week of inflows. According to Refinitiv’s Lipper research data on Thursday, investors sent roughly $16 billion in net cash to U.S. money-market funds for the week ended Wednesday, following their previous week’s inflows of $4.26 billion. U.S.-based equity mutual funds, however, had another rough week. Investors pulled $5.5 billion from U.S.-based equity mutual funds in the week ended Wednesday, Lipper data show, while equity exchange-traded funds garnered $3.7 billion. “Despite the S&P 500 setting three record closes during the fund-flows week, investors remained on the equity sidelines after learning about disappointing Q1 revenue growth from stalwart Alphabet,” said Tom Roseen, head of research services at Lipper.  “There was a split once again between mom-and-pop investors and authorized participants. Equity mutual funds witnessed outflows of $5.5 billion, while equity ETFs took in $3.7 billion during the fund flows week.” U.S.-based taxable exchange-traded funds posted cash withdrawals for the week, with investors withdrawing $700 million in net cash.  “While investors were keeping a keen eye on the FOMC  (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, which concluded on Wednesday on a more hawkish note than some anticipated, taxable-fixed income mutual funds took in small amounts of net new money - $348 million-plus, with ETF investors ... withdrawing $700 million,” Roseen said.  “Interestingly, though, both investors types were net purchasers of municipal bond funds, injecting $877 million into conventional open-end funds and $314 million for ETFs, respectively,” Roseen said. “For the week, the average municipal bond fund returned 0.51 percent.” Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by James DalgleishAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Bolsonaro is due to be honored as the 2019 Person of the Year at the Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce dinner. The gala, which already had to move from its original venue at New York’s American Museum of Natural History after the museum decided not to host, is sponsored by various blue-chip firms, which have come under pressure to ditch their support of the event. Delta said it would no longer be sponsoring the event, but declined to give further details, as did The Financial Times.  “We have decided to withdraw our sponsorship of the ... 2019 Person of the Year Awards Gala Dinner,” Bain said. “Encouraging and celebrating diversity is a core Bain principle.” The Chamber of Commerce did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the boycott. Bolsonaro’s office declined to comment. The moves are a blow for a president who has actively courted closer ties with the United States and particularly President Donald Trump, whom he has praised. Bolsonaro’s rejection by corporate heavyweights also hurts his vow to grow foreign investment in Brazil.  Bolsonaro is loved by his supporters for his outspoken views on guns, family values and the military. But his critics accuse him of racism, homophobia and misogyny. He once said a female lawmaker was too ugly to rape, and said he would not be able to love a gay son.

476,"Wall St. slips as energy drops, investors digest Fed comments - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  11:41 AM / in 5 days","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased further from recent record highs on Thursday as energy shares dropped along with oil prices and investors continued to digest comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The energy index was down the most among the major S&P sectors, falling 1.71% and extending its recent slide. U.S. oil prices slid more than 2 percent on fears of oversupply. “For better or worse, a lot of investors have been trained to respond to the decline of oil, where it could mean demand is light and, thus, economic activity is light,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. Powell’s comments on Wednesday that a decline in inflation this year could be due to transitory factors dampened some investors’ hopes that the U.S. central bank could move later this year to cut interest rates, market watchers said. Traders lowered their bets on a rate cut this year following Powell’s comments, and stocks fell, but many investors said the Fed’s stance makes sense. “I don’t think reasonable investors are looking for a rate cut at this moment. And the good economic conditions don’t necessarily point to a rate hike either,” Forrest said. The S&P 500’s recent run to record highs also may be giving investors reasons to pause.  Stocks have “done extremely well and pockets of the market are overdone,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “Usually when the market moves that quickly, a little bit of caution comes in.” The index has rallied more than 16 percent this year and is entering a period of the year traditionally known as being difficult for equities over the next six months. On the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 122.35 points, or 0.46%, to 26,307.79, the S&P 500 lost 6.21 points, or 0.21%, to 2,917.52, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.87 points, or 0.16%, to 8,036.77. With the first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors are looking for fresh catalysts such as U.S.-China trade developments and economic data. Markets also are waiting for a reading of the Labor Department’s non-farm payrolls data on Friday that is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared with March. More than 350 of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results so far on the first quarter. Analysts now expect earnings to have risen 0.7%, compared with the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data. Among gainers, Qualcomm Inc rose 0.9% after analysts said the chipmaker was well positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales.     The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 1.1%. Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, tumbled 6.1% after reporting a fall in core earnings. Kellogg Co dropped about 3.4% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a decline in first-quarter earnings. But shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc ended up 163% in their market debut Thursday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 50 new highs and 62 new lows.

478,"Dented Fed rate cut hopes drag on stocks; dollar, yields climb - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  1:16 AM / in 5 days","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets declined for a second straight day on Thursday while the dollar and bond yields rose after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell caused investors to lower expectations for a rate cut by the U.S. central bank this year.  On Wall Street, major indices gave up initial gains and closed in the red, weighed down by a drop of more than 1% in energy shares as oil prices slumped.  As earnings season winds down and with the majority of profit reports in the rear mirror, investor focus will shift back to macro concerns such as economic data and trade issues, including Friday’s U.S. employment report.   Global equities snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, as Powell’s comments following the Fed’s policy announcement dampened market expectations the Fed would cut rates this year. The S&P 500 has rallied more than 16 percent this year, but is entering a period of the year traditionally known as being more difficult for equities. Stocks have “done extremely well, and pockets of the market are overdone,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.  “Usually when the market moves that quickly, a little bit of caution comes in.

European shares closed lower, suffering their biggest daily percentage drop in about six weeks, after most markets returned from the May Day holiday. Basic resources shares weighed as metals such as copper declined. Euro zone factory activity data pointed to a third straight month of contraction. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.58% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.39%. Oil prices dropped as the market grappled with oversupply fears as increased U.S. sanctions on Iran had more incremental impact than expected and U.S. crude oil inventories rose sharply. U.S. crude settled down 2.81% at $61.81 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.75, down 1.98% on the day. “One of the larger things today is oil dropping. For better or worse, a lot of investors have been trained to respond to the decline of oil, where it could mean demand is light and, thus, economic activity is light,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. The dollar index strengthened for a second day against a basket of major currencies, going as high as 97.83. The pound slipped after the Bank of England kept rates on hold while lifting its growth forecast but cautioned that Brexit made economic figures harder to interpret. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said investors were underestimating how much interest rates could rise, even as the British central bank kept borrowing costs on hold due to the uncertainty about Britain leaving the European Union. The dollar index rose 0.15%, with the euro down 0.18% to $1.1174. Sterling was last trading at $1.303, down 0.15% on the day.

As Trump seeks a permanent nominee to send to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation, here are some possible successors whose names have already been floated by sources talking to Reuters and in media reports. None immediately responded to requests for comment. Trump’s energy secretary has kept a relatively low profile since winning confirmation by a vote of 62 to 37. As Texas governor from 2000 to 2015, Perry was on the front lines during a spike in migrants seeking asylum in 2014. He opposed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border at the time, but now supports Trump’s signature domestic policy.  The former Virginia attorney general visited the White House last week amid reports that Trump was searching for an “immigration czar” to coordinate policy across the government. As attorney general and state senator, Cuccinelli developed a reputation as a conservative hard-liner on a range of issues, including immigration. He has called for denying citizenship to U.S.-born children whose parents are in the country illegally, and authorized law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of anyone they stopped.  He lost a bid for governor in 2013, and recently has been involved with the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political group that supports right-leaning candidates. The former Kansas secretary of state has built a national reputation as an uncompromising opponent of illegal immigration. Since losing the Kansas governor’s race last November, Kobach has been angling for a job in the Trump administration, telling Breitbart News over the weekend that he would be open to serving as a White House immigration “czar.” He also proposed blocking illegal immigrants from sending money back to Mexico.   Kobach could have a hard time winning Senate confirmation due to his hard-line views and unsuccessful 2018 campaign, where he lost to a Democrat in a heavily Republican state. A former homeland security advisor to President George W. Bush, Townsend now is an analyst for CBS television. She says Trump considered her as a possible replacement for FBI Director James Comey after he was fired in 2017. As commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, McAleenan said last month that the immigration system was at a “breaking point.” A career law enforcement official, McAleenan has served on and off in the division since its inception after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. McAleenan has won the respect of Republicans and Democrats and easily won confirmation to his current post in March 2018 by a vote of 77 to 19. He has pushed Congress to detain families seeking asylum until their cases are heard in court, rather than releasing them. However, he has not always lined up with Trump’s aggressive approach to border security. He has praised the effectiveness of U.S. aid to Central America, which Trump has threatened to cut off.

484,Republicans want census data on citizenship for redistricting - Reuters,"April 8, 2019 /  11:05 AM / a month ago","9 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - John Murante, a conservative Nebraska senator, last year introduced a bill to prevent non-citizens from being counted when the state redraws its voting maps. He said the effort aimed to ensure each election district contained similar numbers of voters, but opponents argued it intended to undermine the political power of immigrant communities. Murante’s bill died after its critics pointed out a lack of granular data on where the state’s non-citizens live.  That data may soon be available. The Trump administration believes its proposed question about citizenship on the 2020 Census will help states that want to draw citizens-only voting districts in the next round of redistricting by providing the first comprehensive data on non-citizens in about 70 years, according to a Reuters review of court and federal register documents and interviews with more than a dozen state lawmakers. Such a change would provide a new opportunity for Republican-controlled states - those most likely to adopt citizens-only redistricting - to redraw their voting maps in a way that could help their party win more state-level elections. Currently, state and federal voting districts are drawn to be roughly equal in population, regardless of how many residents can legally vote. That means tallies for district-drawing purposes include non-citizens, such as green-card holders and undocumented immigrants. Democrats and immigrant rights activists say this system ensures elected leaders represent everyone in their district who depends on public services such as schools and trash pickup, regardless of voting eligibility. Republicans argue that districts should be the same size so each vote carries the same weight. If one district has far fewer eligible voters than another, each vote there has more influence on election outcomes.  That’s a problem for Republicans because the eligible voters in immigrant-heavy districts tend to support Democrats. Trump administration officials have been considering the merits of citizens-only redistricting since 2017 - well before announcing their intention in March 2018 to add the citizenship question to the decennial survey, according to court documents filed as part of litigation over the citizenship question. And in December, the Census Bureau issued a notice in the Federal Register saying that if any states “indicate a need for ... citizenship data” to use in redistricting, it would “make a design change” to provide it. Republican lawmakers in Texas, Arizona, Missouri and Nebraska told Reuters they would consider making use of the citizenship data if it became available. The tactic is prohibited at the federal level by past U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have interpreted the U.S. constitution as requiring that U.S. House districts be based on total population. But the court, in a 2016 case known as Evenwel v. Abbott, left the door open for state-level districts to use other metrics. The Commerce Department, which includes the Census Bureau, declined to comment on whether redistricting was part of the motivation for proposing the citizenship question.  James Whitehorne, the chief of the Census Bureau’s Redistricting & Voting Rights Office, called the federal register notice routine. “We’re supposed to provide states with what they identify as needing,” he said. U.S. voting districts are drawn at the state level, most often by state legislators, giving the party in power control over how the lines are redrawn.  While both Republicans and Democrats frame the debate over citizen-only districts around fairness, demographic experts point out that both sides have a lot at stake politically. Data from the nonpartisan APM Research Lab showed that 95 of the 100 U.S. congressional districts with the highest foreign-born populations are represented by Democrats. Similar data for state-level seats was not available. Redrawing such districts with citizen-only populations would give Republicans a better shot by expanding the districts into more conservative areas, said Albert Kauffman, a professor at St. Mary’s School of Law in San Antonio who has studied redistricting and opposes excluding non-citizens.  In Texas, a citizens-only map could strip Latino voters of majorities in two or three state senate seats and six or seven state representative seats, Kauffman said, pointing out that Hispanic voters traditionally lean left.  “Democrats know they would probably lose seats at every level,” Kauffman said. Immigrant rights activists and Democratic-led cities and states have sued the Trump administration to prevent it from asking census respondents about their citizenship, and the Supreme Court will decide by June if the question can remain. Opponents argue the administration aims to use the question to intimidate immigrants out of responding to the census, which would cost their communities political representation and a share of about $800 billion in annual federal aid allocated based on population. The administration disputes that. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his decision to add the question was aimed at getting the Justice Department the comprehensive citizenship data it needs to better enforce Voting Rights Act provisions that protect minorities from discrimination.  Ross has not publicly commented on how citizenship data might be used in redistricting. But Census records, as well as emails released during the litigation over the citizenship question, showed he was thinking about citizens-only redistricting well before he announced plans to add the question. In April of 2017, at the behest of former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, Ross spoke with former Kansas Secretary of State and noted immigration hawk Kris Kobach, according to the emails. One topic of discussion was “the problem that aliens ... are still counted for congressional apportionment,” according to a subsequent email from Kobach to Ross describing their conversation.  The following month, Ross asked Commerce Senior Policy Advisor David Langdon to look into whether non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, are included in voting maps, according to Langdon’s deposition in the litigation over the citizenship question.  Kobach and Langdon did not respond to requests for comment.  A handful of states will likely request the census data on citizenship if the question survives its legal challenges, state lawmakers and a Republican strategist told Reuters.  Lawmakers and state officials from Arizona, Missouri, Nebraska and Texas said in interviews they are considering citizen-only districts. Republicans in Tennessee also voiced support for citizens-only redistricting in court papers filed in the Evenwel Supreme Court case. Reuters reached out to several of the Tennessee lawmakers who signed the court brief, but all declined to comment. Missouri Representative Dean Plocher, a Republican who sponsored unsuccessful legislation last year to base Missouri’s voting districts on citizen population, said the effort is aimed solely at equalizing the power of all votes in the state. He said he hadn’t considered how such changes might affect his party’s chances in elections. Nebraska’s Murante - the former senator behind his state’s failed citizens-only redistricting bill and now the state’s treasurer - said he supports citizens-only maps because the state’s constitution requires that “aliens” be excluded from voting districts. Immigrant rights activists counter that citizens-only districts could be forced to expand in ways that weaken the political influence of immigrant communities. The effect could be particularly pronounced in places such as south Texas, where immigrants make up more than a quarter of the population, said Juan Hinojosa, a Democratic state senator.  Hinojosa’s district includes areas known as colonias — informal communities of poor, largely Hispanic families. Citizen-only redistricting would make it more likely that anti-immigration Republicans would win elections in the border region, Hinojosa said. The question of how to count non-citizens in voting districts may end up at the Supreme Court, said Kel Seliger, a Republican Texas state senator, who told Reuters that lawmakers there would explore citizen-only maps. “You’ve got be careful,” he said, “that the Republican bias doesn’t get us on the wrong side of the Constitution.”  Reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Richard Valdmanis, Brian Thevenot and Paul ThomaschAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

485,"Occidental shareholders criticize bid for Anadarko, Buffett financing - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  7:28 PM / in 5 days","5 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - Several major Occidental Petroleum Corp shareholders have voiced opposition to the oil company’s $38 billion bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp that now includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett. Occidental and Chevron Corp are battling for Anadarko and its holdings of nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost production has helped turn the United States into the world’s top oil producer at 12.3 million barrels per day. Occidental shares were trading on Thursday at $57.48, down sharply from $66.63 a month ago, prior to rumors it might challenge Chevron. It trumped Chevron’s bid last week, and its offer now includes $10 billion in financing from Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in exchange for preferred shares that would pay an 8 percent dividend. Major Occidental shareholders told Reuters they opposed  the plan. They called the $76-per-share bid for Anadarko expensive and cited concerns about the cyclical nature of the oil business as well as the cost of getting financing from Buffett. Several Occidental shareholders said they viewed Chevron’s lower $65-per-share bid as a better fit because it could more easily swallow a company of Anadarko’s size.     T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which holds shares in all three oil companies, cited merger risks and the cost of the Berkshire infusion. John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said Buffett’s deal could allow Occidental to restructure its cash-and-stock deal to avoid a shareholder vote, although its current offer includes a vote.  T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth largest shareholder, had 21.1 million shares at the end of 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon figures, along with 8 million Chevron shares and 865,000 Anadarko shares. Berkshire would receive a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of common stock at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, in addition to the preferred stock that will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum. “That’s very expensive paper,” Linehan said of the agreement with Berkshire. “They could have borrowed far cheaper than that.”  Occidental did not respond to a request for comment on shareholder objections to the current proposal. Before the Buffett financing plan, it said the deal would result in $3.5 billion in cash flow improvements and that it would sell $10 billion to $15 billion in assets to reduce debt.  Moody’s Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko’s debt and additional borrowings to cover the offer would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody’s put the company’s debt rating under review for downgrade.  South Texas Money Management, which has $2.3 billion in assets under management, including shares of Chevron and Occidental, hopes Chevron prevails.  At the end of March they owned around 580,000 shares of Occidental and 370,000 shares of Chevron worth $38.5 million and $45.5 million, respectively.   “Right now their bid would allow them to extract a lot of value for that deal,” said Christian Ledoux, South Texas’ chief investment officer. Chevron’s offer was constructed as 25 percent in cash and 75 percent in stock, compared with the 50-50 split from Occidental. Even if Chevron raised its bid and offered “a little more cash,” Ledoux would still consider the deal a good one for Chevron because the company has expertise in Anadarko’s shale, liquefied natural gas and offshore assets. Chevron has not raised its bid for Anadarko, saying its agreement would provide “the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders.” Occidental and Chevron, two of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian by production volumes, each believe they can best squeeze more oil from Anadarko’s 240,000 acres (97,120 hectares) in the top shale field. Occidental’s annual meeting is May 10, “and we will be interested to see the interaction between shareholders and the Board,” Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. “On paper the (Occidental) deal looks great if oil is at $65, but we’re in a cyclical industry where commodity prices change dramatically,” said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April. “They’re basically putting the company at risk.” Reporting by Jennifer Hiller; editing by Gary McWilliams and David GregorioAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

486,US STOCKS-Wall St eases as investors digest Fed comments - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  7:15 PM / in 5 days","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Oil stocks track crude slump * Beyond Meat jumps in market debut * Indexes fall: Dow 0.7%, S&P 0.4%, Nasdaq 0.4% (Updates to late afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eased further from recent record highs on Thursday as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell the previous day that dampened some investor hopes of an interest rate cut this year. A drop in oil prices dragged down energy shares, adding to the bearish tone. Oil prices slid on record U.S. crude production that led to a surge in inventories, and the energy index was 1.1% lower, the most among the major S&P sectors. On Wednesday, Powell sought to downplay low inflation as transient, forcing traders to lower their bets on a rate cut this year and snapping a rally in the S&P 500 on Wednesday. Stocks have “done extremely well, and pockets of the market are overdone,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “Usually when the market moves that quickly, a little bit of caution comes in. And you can argue the Fed, based on the press conference comments yesterday, doesn’t seem to be in a rush to cut rates.” The S&P 500 remains up 16.3% for the year to date. With first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors are looking for fresh catalysts such as U.S.-China trade developments and economic data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 174.73 points, or 0.66%, to 26,255.41, the S&P 500 lost 11.56 points, or 0.40%, to 2,912.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 30.83 points, or 0.38%, to 8,018.81. Markets are waiting for a reading of the Labor Department’s non-farm payrolls data on Friday that is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared with March. More than 350 of the S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and analysts now expect earnings to rise 0.7%, compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Among gainers, Qualcomm Inc rose 0.5% after analysts said the chipmaker was well-positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 0.8%. Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, tumbled 6.4% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Kellogg Co dropped about 3.6% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a 36.5 percent decline in first-quarter earnings. At the same time, shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat Inc were up 173% in their market debut on Thursday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.60-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 59 new lows.

487,Dollar gains as traders pare U.S. rate-cut expectations - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:57 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar gained against most currencies on Thursday as traders pared their bets of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment about U.S. inflation. The pound slipped after the Bank of England lifted its growth forecasts but warned that Brexit continued to cloud the outlook for monetary policy. Trading volume picked up as some European markets reopened after closing for May Day on Wednesday. Chinese and Japanese markets will remain shut for domestic holidays the rest of the week. The greenback proved resilient since Powell said at a news conference on Wednesday that the factors dragging on inflation might be “transitory” and he saw no case for a rate move in either direction. “That took some of the air out of the rate-cut talk,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. “Still the market is biased toward a rate cut as the Fed’s next move.” Interest rate futures implied traders see about a 49% chance the Fed would lower key lending rates at year-end, down from 61% late on Wednesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. In late U.S. trading, an index that tracks the greenback against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was up 0.215% at 97.824. A solid U.S. payrolls report due at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) on Friday would bolster the notion the world’s biggest economy is track for its longest expansion ever this summer, supporting the dollar, analysts said. “The dollar is holding on,” said Simona Mocuta, senior economist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. “We have all slowed, but growth in the U.S. is still better.” Analysts polled by Reuters forecast U.S. employers likely added 185,000 workers in April, a tad fewer than March, and the unemployment rate likely held at 3.8% last month. The greenback erased initial losses against the euro, which rose earlier after German retail sales contracted by less than expected while PMI surveys from Germany to Spain were broadly within expectations. The single currency was 0.18% lower at $1.1175 and down 0.1% at 124.605 yen. Meanwhile, sterling retreated from a two-week high against the dollar as the BOE’s decision to leave rates unchanged at 0.75% reinforced the view that UK policymakers are in no hurry to raise rates amid concerns about ongoing Brexit negotiations. The pound was down 0.15% at $1.3028, while the euro was up 0.06% at 85.8 pence.

488,UPDATE 1-Brazil's trade surplus widens to $6.06 billion in April - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  7:00 PM / 5 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds detail, context, quote) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, May 2 (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $6.06 billion in April, the Economy Ministry said on Thursday, wider than the previous month but just shy of the median $6.7 billion surplus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It was the second largest surplus ever recorded for the month of April and the biggest monthly surplus so far this year, a result of exports totaling $19.69 billion and imports of $13.63 billion. Compared to April last year, Brazil’s trade surplus rose 2.3 percent. Exports in April were led by sales of commodities, manufactured goods and semi-manufactured goods, while imports of capital goods and consumer goods fell 10 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, the Economy Ministry said. The total surplus for the first four months of 2019 stood at $16.58 billion, down 8.7 percent from the $18.165 billion registered in the same period a year ago thanks to a steeper fall in exports than imports. In the 12 months to April, Brazil’s trade surplus was $57.07 billion, down 10.5 percent from the $63.79 billion surplus posted in the 12 months to April last year. All else being equal, a widening trade surplus boosts economic growth, and a narrowing surplus or deficit is a drag on growth. Brazil’s central bank cut its 2019 growth forecast in March to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent, noting that net trade is expected to shave 0.2 percentage points off overall growth.

489,"Puerto Rico board hits Wall Street banks, bondholders with lawsuits - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  7:00 PM / 5 days ago","4 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board said on Thursday it sued some owners of potentially invalid bonds of the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth, as well as Wall Street banks and firms that participated in various debt issuances in an effort to recoup more than $1 billion. The litigation, which was in the works since last month, follows more than 230 complaints the board filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico earlier this week against private companies, individuals and service providers that received about $4.2 billion in payments from the island’s government as far back as four years before its May 3, 2017, bankruptcy filing. The board, which had only two years from that date under a statute of limitations to file certain claims, was denied an extension last week by a federal judge hearing Puerto Rico’s cases aimed at restructuring about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. At issue is more than $6 billion of general obligation bonds sold in 2012 and 2014 that the board contends exceeded a debt limit in Puerto Rico’s constitution. The validity of some bonds issued by the island’s Public Buildings Authority, as well as pension bonds, is also being questioned. Judge Laura Taylor Swain has yet to rule in the matter. The lawsuits contend that bond underwriters, attorneys and advisers “aided and abetted” Puerto Rico in failing to meet its fiduciary duties, as it issued debt unlawfully and while being “clearly insolvent.” In participating in these transactions, the defendants acted “for their own profit and unjust enrichment,” according to the litigation. Defendants include many of Wall Street’s biggest investment banks, as well as law firm Sidley Austin.   Linton Childs, Sidley Austin’s general counsel, said, “We believe that putative claims asserted against the firm are both untimely and entirely without merit.” The board argued that the proceeds and profits made by the defendants “are recoverable as fraudulent transfers” and that the court should award damages. In the case of $3.5 billion of junk-rated GO bonds sold in 2014, the board alleged that underwriters and advisers “knew or should have known” that the transaction ran afoul of the commonwealth’s constitutional debt limit. It also contended underwriters bought these bonds at discount, allowing them to “reap large profits” from the resale of the bonds to investors.  In addition, the board sued individual investors and banks that owned at least $2.5 million of the bonds between May 2013 and May 2017 in an effort to recoup debt service payments they received.  “The oversight board did not take the decision to claw back payments lightly,” said David Skeel, a member of the board’s Special Claims Committee, in a statement. “However, Puerto Rico’s taxpayers should not have to shoulder payments the government made to big investors that should never have been made in the first place.”  The board said while it is “sympathetic” to bondholders, Puerto Rican law limits government borrowing authority to avoid “sacrificing services necessary to maintain the health, safety, and welfare of Puerto Rico and its people.”  Various investment banks were also sued as parties to interest rate swap agreements with the commonwealth that earned them almost $400 million in termination fees. According to the board, these institutions “knew that the underlying bonds tied to these swap transactions carried substantial risk,” which would result in an unfavorable outcome to the commonwealth. “Despite this knowledge, the swap counterparty defendants continued to recommend and cause Puerto Rico issuers to enter into additional swap transactions on bonds they themselves underwrote,” the lawsuit stated.

491,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks fall, dollar, yields climb as Fed rate cut seen less likely - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  6:45 PM / 5 days ago","4 Min Read* European stocks struggle, factory data weak * Wall Street mixed * Bank of England keeps rates on hold (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Global equity markets declined for a second straight day on Thursday while the dollar and bond yields rose after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell caused investors to alter expectations for a rate cut by the central bank this year. On Wall Street, the Dow and S&P gave up initial gains and turned negative as the energy sector weakened on a drop in oil prices. The Nasdaq showed modest gains, buoyed in part by a climb in Oracle shares after its quarterly results. As earnings season winds down and with the majority of profit reports in the rear mirror, investor focus will shift back to macro concerns such as economic data and trade issues, including Friday’s U.S. employment report. Global equities snapped a three-day streak of gains on Wednesday, as Powell’s comments following the Fed’s policy announcement dampened market expectations the Fed would cut rates this year. “The fact is they got spooked yesterday, because they are all betting the Fed is going to cut,” said Ken Polcari, managing principal at Butcher Joseph Asset Management in New York. “After what happened yesterday and the nervousness that created they are going to take any headline now that is negative and they are going to accentuate it.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 150.9 points, or 0.57%, to 26,279.24, the S&P 500 lost 8.96 points, or 0.31%, to 2,914.77 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.82 points, or 0.33%, to 8,022.82. European shares closed lower, suffering their biggest daily percentage drop in about six weeks, as most markets returned from the May Day holiday. Basic resources shares weighed as metals such as copper slumped. In addition, euro zone factory activity data pointed to a third straight month of contraction. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.58% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.44%. Oil prices fell more than 2% as the market grappled with oversupply fears as increased U.S. sanctions on Iran had more incremental impact than expected and U.S. crude oil inventories rose sharply. U.S. crude fell 3.19% to $61.57 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.47, down 2.37% on the day. The dollar index strengthened for a second day against a basket of major currencies, going as high as 97.83. The pound slipped after the Bank of England kept rates on hold while lifting its growth forecast but cautioned that Brexit made economic figures harder to interpret. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said investors were underestimating how much interest rates could rise, even as the British central bank kept borrowing costs on hold due to the uncertainty about Britain leaving the European Union. The dollar index rose 0.11%, with the euro down 0.13% to $1.1179. Sterling was last trading at $1.3027, down 0.17% on the day. U.S. Treasury yields rose as investors continued to digest Powell’s comments. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.5504%, from 2.511% late on Wednesday.

492,BlackRock to co-host investor event with Mexico: CEO Fink - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:45 PM / in 5 days","2 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - BlackRock is working to choose a date to co-host an investor summit with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s administration, Chief Executive Larry Fink wrote in a letter made public by the government on Thursday. BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, is partnering with Mexico as the country installs internet nationwide and develops the southern isthmus, Fink wrote in the letter to the president. Lopez Obrador told a news conference on Thursday that BlackRock’s letter, dated April 18, expressed “confidence in the country.”  Despite vows to boost both private and public investment, Lopez Obrador’s economic decision-making has rattled investors. In particular, his cancellation of a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport in October, a few weeks before taking office, sparked billions of dollars of losses on Mexican financial markets.  The leftist leader has called for installing a fiber-optic cable throughout areas with poor connectivity, as well as free internet in public places. He has also proposed infrastructure projects in the long-neglected southern region, including a train linking the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Private sector analysts have been cutting their Mexican growth forecasts for 2019. Fink said BlackRock was “firmly committed” to Mexico. The asset manager has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to invest Mexico, including a focus on infrastructure.

495,Explainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report? - Reuters,"April 2, 2019 /  9:39 PM / a month ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the House of Representatives are gearing up to issue subpoenas to try to obtain Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report on Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election and President Donald Trump’s actions related to the inquiry. The question is: how successful will they be? Attorney General William Barr, who has broad authority under Justice Department regulations to decide how much of Mueller’s report to release, sent lawmakers a four-page letter on March 24  explaining Mueller’s “principal conclusions” and has promised to release the nearly 400-page report by the middle of this month, with some parts blacked out, or “redacted.” That has not satisfied Democrats, who control the House. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Wednesday to authorize a subpoena to compel the Justice Department to hand over the complete report, without redactions, as well as underlying evidence. Here is an explanation of the legal hurdles Democrats must clear in their subpoena effort, important judicial precedents and Barr’s rationale for keeping parts of the report confidential. Yes. Committees of the House and Senate possess the power to issues subpoenas for documents held by the executive branch or other subjects in investigations. Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress is a co-equal branch of the federal government alongside the executive branch and judiciary. If Barr refuses to comply with a Judiciary Committee subpoena to obtain the full report and underlying investigative material, the House could vote to hold him “in contempt” and turn to the courts to enforce the subpoena. Legal experts said that process could take years.  Barr’s “principal conclusions” letter said Mueller’s inquiry did not establish that Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia. Barr also said Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the Republican president committed obstruction of justice but also did not exonerate him. Barr subsequently concluded that Trump had not engaged in criminal obstruction. The letter provided scant details of the findings, though Trump immediately claimed “complete and total exoneration.” The Mueller investigation has cast a cloud over Trump’s presidency. House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into Trump, who is seeking re-election in 2020. A situation analogous to the current subpoena fight unfolded during the presidency of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. In 2012, the House, then controlled by Republicans, subpoenaed internal Justice Department documents related to a failed federal law enforcement operation to track illegal gun sales, dubbed “Fast and Furious.” Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, refused to comply. The House voted to hold him in contempt, marking the first time in U.S. history that Congress took such action against a sitting member of a president’s Cabinet. The Justice Department later turned over thousands of pages of documents but the matter was not resolved until after Obama left office, with a settlement reached in 2018. Barr told lawmakers in a March 29 letter that he was making “redactions that are required” before releasing the Mueller report. He cited four reasons for redactions: protecting secret grand jury proceedings; safeguarding intelligence-gathering sources and methods; shielding material that could affect ongoing investigations; and protecting information that would unduly infringe on personal privacy and reputations. Grand juries are groups of citizens who meet in secret and decide whether to authorize criminal indictments or demands for evidence sought by prosecutors. U.S. law generally requires that information obtained from grand jury proceedings be kept secret, though there are exceptions that let Congress, and even the general public, see it. Barr also could redact information by citing a legal doctrine called executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government. Federal law and judicial precedent could play a role in the subpoena fight. Under U.S. law, grand jury testimony generally must be kept secret. But if a grand jury matter involves “grave hostile acts of a foreign power” or other intelligence information, the information can be shared with appropriate government officials. The law also lets a judge release grand jury information when strong public interest is at stake. A 1974 court decision involving Republican President Richard Nixon gives Democrats strong ammunition to argue that they are entitled to any grand jury information redacted by Barr. Leon Jaworski, a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, produced a report that relied on evidence from grand jury proceedings. H.R. Haldeman, who had served Nixon as White House chief of staff, sought to block that information from Congress, citing the same grand jury secrecy provision mentioned by Barr. The dispute ended up before a panel of federal appeals court judges in Washington, which ruled 5-1 against Haldeman. The court said Congress clearly needed the material to conduct an effective impeachment investigation, and noted that the Democratic-led House Judiciary committee had taken “elaborate precautions to insure against unnecessary and inappropriate disclosure of these materials.” The committee approved articles of impeachment against Nixon as Congress began the process of trying to remove him from office. Nixon resigned before the full House could vote on impeachment.  If Barr were to cite executive privilege in redacting material, a 1974 Supreme Court ruling could come into play. Nixon withheld tape recordings and other material subpoenaed by Jaworski, citing executive privilege. The high court then ordered him to give the material to a federal district court, saying the president’s interest in keeping his communications secret was outweighed by the judiciary’s need for evidence.

496,White House to Democrats seeking Trump tax returns: 'Never' - Reuters,"April 7, 2019 /  1:23 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tax returns will never be handed over to Democratic lawmakers, White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on Sunday, defying an effort in Congress to learn more about the real estate mogul’s personal finances. Asked on “Fox News Sunday” if congressional Democrats will succeed in obtaining the Republican president’s tax returns, Mulvaney said: “No, never. Nor should they.” He dismissed an effort to obtain the returns, launched on Wednesday by U.S. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, as a political ploy from Democrats who will never stop attacking Trump. “Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents. That is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt,” Mulvaney said. Democrats countered that Neal’s request to the Treasury Department for Trump’s returns is grounded in law and a needed inquiry, given Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax records and to divest himself of his business interests. “This is a legitimate authority that the Congress has. This president, by the way, is the least transparent president that we’ve had in half a century,” Democratic Representative Dan Kildee, a tax committee member, told ABC’s “This Week.” Democratic Representative Ben Ray Lujan noted that presidents for decades have voluntarily released their income tax returns. “This is not political, as our Republican colleagues are making it out to be,” he told “Fox News Sunday.” An attorney for Trump on Friday blasted House Democrats’ request for six years of Trump’s personal and business returns as “a misguided attempt” to politicize the tax laws, accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits. In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead, Trump lawyer William Consovoy said the request filed by Neal flouts “constitutional constraints.” Republican Senator Mitt Romney urged Trump to release his tax returns as promised but criticized Democratic efforts to force the issue through legislative action as “moronic.”  “The courts are not going to say that you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” One of many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. court system, the House Democrats’ probe into the president’s tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a dealmaker. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump broke with a decades-old practice of making his tax returns public and continues to refuse to release them as president, while retaining ownership in many enterprises, ranging from golf courses and hotels and other properties. If Congress takes the administration to court over Trump’s taxes then little case law would be available to help guide judges, legal experts said, both because the statute cited by Neal to obtain the returns has hardly ever been contested, and because most document disputes between the legislative and executive branches of government are resolved by negotiation. The losing party could appeal, ultimately to the U.S. Supreme Court. If litigation extends into 2021, a judge could also force a newly elected Congress to start the process over, said Ross Garber, an attorney who specializes in political investigations.

497,Cory Booker raises more than $5 million for U.S. presidential run - Reuters,"April 7, 2019 /  8:28 PM / a month ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - New Jersey Senator Cory Booker raised more than $5 million for his presidential election campaign in February and March, and has more than $6.1 million in cash on hand, his campaign said on Sunday. That is considerably less than others among the more than 15 Democrats who have announced they are running for the party’s nomination. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $12 million in the first three months of 2019 while Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who recently saw a bump in opinion polls but is still considered a long-shot, announced Monday that he had raised $7 million. Beto O’Rourke, a former U.S congressman from Texas, raised $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his bid for the presidency, his campaign said. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders raised $5.9 million in the first day after announcing his candidacy, and later disclosed he had raised $10 million in a week. Fundraising has become an early way to prove to donors and potential supporters that a candidate is viable. Donations to Booker averaged about $34, with 82 percent of the donors new supporters of the candidate, spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said on Twitter. Candidates are required by law to report all campaign donations, and cannot accept more than $2,800 from a single donor during the primary race. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that her campaign would not hold any formal fundraising events and instead rely solely on “small-dollar” donations, or contributions collected online.

498,PRECIOUS-Gold drops to 4-month low after U.S. Fed douses rate cut hopes - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  3:31 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read* Gold slips for second straight session * Platinum touches lowest in a month * Silver hovers close to a more than four-month low * Dollar extends gains on Fed statement * Markets eye Friday’s U.S. jobs data, U.S.-China trade talks (Updates prices) By K. Sathya Narayanan May 2 (Reuters) - Gold prices slumped to an over four-month low on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) axed any hopes for a rate cut in the near term, subduing demand for the non-interest bearing bullion. Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,270.22 per ounce as of 1:42 pm EDT (1742 GMT), after touching its lowest since end-December 2018 at $1,265.85 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures settled down 1 percent at $1,272 an ounce. “A lot of people were positioned for the FOMC statement to be little bit more dovish than it actually was,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with Forex.com. “We have seen an implied odds of a 2019 rate cut fall from 75 percent to 50 percent so people are revising their rate cut expectations as the Fed was not as dovish as people expected.” The Federal Reserve kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, in line with the market’s expectations. However, market participants were taken by surprise when the central bank emphasised it saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut any time soon, citing rising employment and economic growth. Also weighing on gold was the U.S. dollar, which gained 0.1 percent against key rivals on the Fed’s comments, making gold costlier for investors holding other currencies. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold and tends to boost the U.S. dollar. “Market participants are now looking out for the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday and if we break out over 200,000 (jobs) then that will put additional pressure on gold,” said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting total non-farm employment to have increased by 185,000 jobs in April. Investors are also closely monitoring the U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a quick resolution to the year-long tit-for-tat tariff war. Any positive news from the negotiations tend to boost appetite for riskier assets, denting gold’s safe-haven appeal. Elsewhere, silver fell 0.5 percent to $14.60 an ounce, holding close to a more than four-month low of $14.52 touched earlier in the session. Platinum slipped 2.1 percent to $845.49, after touching its lowest in a month. Palladium was steady at $1,352.28 per ounce, having touched its lowest since Jan. 25 at $1,309.67 in the previous session. (Reporting by K.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sought to downplay low inflation as transient, forcing traders to lower their bets on a rate cut this year and snapping a rally in the S&P 500 on Wednesday. Adding to woes, oil prices slid on record U.S. crude production that led to a surge in inventories, dragging the energy index 1.06% lower, the most among the major S&P sectors. With first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors are looking for fresh catalysts such as U.S.-China trade developments and economic data. “The markets seemed to be stalling out after hitting all-time highs and the focus just shifted towards taking some money off the table,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “There is just a genuine lack of catalysts, now that most of the big names have reported there is no real driver.” Markets are also waiting for a reading of the Labor Market’s non-farm payrolls data on Friday that is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared with March. At 12:50 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 202.80 points, or 0.77%, at 26,227.34, the S&P 500 was down 13.61 points, or 0.47%, at 2,910.12 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 40.44 points, or 0.50%, at 8,009.20. More than 350 of the S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and analysts now expect earnings to rise 0.7%, compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Among gainers, Qualcomm Inc rose 1.71% after analysts said the chipmaker was well-positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 0.82%. Financial stocks, which rose 0.13%, were also among a few gainers, helped by MetLife Inc. The insurer’s shares rose 3.85% after beating quarterly profit estimates, helped by strong underwriting, volume growth, as well as higher investment income. Under Armour Inc gained 4.12% after the sportswear maker posted strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, benefiting from higher demand in overseas markets. Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, tumbled 5.42% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Kellogg Co dropped about 3.27% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a 36.5 percent decline in first-quarter earnings. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.31-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 41 new highs and 53 new lows.

501,Indivior's Suboxone decline slower than feared as company bets on new opioid drug - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:20 PM / 5 days ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - Indivior Plc’s best selling drug is losing market share slower than some analysts had predicted and its new drug is performing on target, lifting shares in the company despite its forecast of a possible loss this year. The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year cleared the way for market access to cheaper alternatives to Indivior’s blockbuster opioid addiction treatment Suboxone film, a move which the company itself said could result in the rapid loss of market share. The British based company, which reported revenue of over $1 billion last year - generated largely from the U.S. - said on Thursday it expects 2019 net revenue to fall to between $525 million and $575 million this year. It also warned it could post a loss of up to $40 million or a profit of up to $10 million this year, versus analyst expectations of a loss of $14 million. Sales in the U.S., rose despite generic competition. The company, which was indicted last month for illegal marketing of Suboxone in the United States and fined $3 billion, launched its own generic in February to mitigate the hit to sales.  The stock closed up 5.2 percent in London. It had been pummeled following the decision to open up the U.S. market to cheaper copycat drugs and has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the indictment. The U.S. accuses Indivior of deceiving doctors and healthcare benefit programs into believing its Suboxone Film version was safer and less susceptible to abuse than similar drugs, at a substantial cost to the government - a key customer. Graphic: Indivior loses over £3 billion in value since FDA first approves generic - tmsnrt.rs/2D1tfwP Indivior’s generic registered a strong launch and managed to claim about 50 percent share of the generic film market, Finance Chief Mark Crossley said on an analyst call. In line with the company’s earlier warning, market share of its branded Suboxone fell, but not as much as feared. “Despite generic versions of Suboxone film launching on 20 February, film market share stood at 40 percent on 31 March, which implies a much slower market share erosion than typical,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.    Crossley said Suboxone Film’s resilience was driven by its patient base. “We believe the switch to a generic product is certainly being carefully considered by payers and healthcare professionals,” adding that pricing also played a role.  However, he said this was not sustainable. The industry expects Suboxone’s market share could be reduced by 70 percent in the coming months and 90 percent by the end of this year.       Indivior is hoping its long-lasting opioid addiction Sublocade injection will make up for Suboxone’s losses. Sublocade injections are delivered direct to doctors’ offices for administration - a move by the company to curb opioid abuse, instead of having to go to the pharmacy to pick up tablets or its existing under-the-tongue Suboxone film. Sublocade sales rose to $11 million in the first quarter, up from $7 million in the fourth quarter and on track to meet the company’s annual expectations of between $50 million and $70 million.  Indivior said there was “encouraging progress” in delivering Sublocade and this will drive accelerated net revenue growth to reach its targeted $1 billion-plus peak net revenue goal.

502,European shares dip after Fed outlook; SAP weighs - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  8:12 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares had their worst session in more than six weeks on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve dampened rate cut bets, while gains by Volkswagen and Bayer helped cap losses.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.7 percent with most major country indices well in the red on returning from the May Day holiday. Germany’s DAX, which outperformed through most of the day, closed flat as software firm SAP weighed. Madrid’s IBEX fell 1.6 percent.  U.S. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed the doves on  Wednesday, signaling little appetite to adjust interest rates anytime soon.  “That was interpreted as somewhat more hawkish than expected given that the market has been pricing in a reduction perhaps as early as this year,” said Ken Odeluga analyst at City Index.  “Investors see the need to recalibrate their expectations because the chair said there was no greater bias for a cut or a raise in the near term.” SAP fell 1.3 percent and weighed the most on STOXX 600. Security researchers said up to 50,000 companies running SAP software are at greater risk of being hacked. The basic resources sector dropped 1.6 percent after copper prices fell to their lowest in more than two months. [MET/L]  Andritz was among the biggest decliners on STOXX 600 after the  Austrian engineer cut its full-year profit forecast, partly in response to weak car industry demand that hit its metals business. Consumer stocks slipped on online-only fashion retailer Zalando’s 3.3 percent fall after it announced plans to charge delivery fees for small orders in more markets. Helping temper those losses, German drugmaker Bayer was the biggest boost to the pan-region index after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that glyphosate, the key ingredient in Bayer’s Roundup weed killer, is not a carcinogen. This contradicts decisions by U.S. juries that found it caused cancer in people and led to thousands of lawsuits against Bayer. Carmaker Volkswagen jumped 3.7 percent as shrugged off a 1 billion euro legal charge and met first-quarter operating profit forecasts. But other auto stocks such as planemaker Airbus and its supplier Safran slipped. Euro zone factory activity contracted for a third month in April, data showed, hurt by weak global demand.  Shares in Swiss toilet and plumbing supplies maker Geberit vaulted to the top of STOXX after first-quarter earnings beat expectations.

503,US STOCKS-Wall Street turns lower as oil stocks drag - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:30 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Oil stocks drag S&P lower * Under Armour jumps on profit forecast raise * Dow Inc slips as core earnings drop * Indexes fall: Dow 0.90%, S&P 0.71%, Nasdaq 0.77% (Updates prices, adds comments) By Shreyashi   Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks headed lower on Thursday as a slide in energy stocks added to gloom after the Federal Reserve quashed hopes of interest rate cuts this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sought to downplay low inflation as transient, putting breaks to a rally in the S&P 500 on Wednesday and driving down bets among traders about a rate cut. Adding to the woes, oil prices slid on record U.S. crude production that led to a surge in inventories, dragging the energy index 1.4% lower, the most among the major S&P sectors. With first-quarter earnings season winding down, investors are looking for fresh catalysts such as U.S.-China trade developments and economic data. “The markets seemed to be stalling out after hitting all-time highs and the focus just shifted towards taking some money off the table,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “There is just a genuine lack of catalysts, now that most of the big names have reported there is no real driver.” Markets are also waiting for a reading of the Labor Market’s non-farm payrolls data on Friday, which is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared to March. At 12:03 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 238.04 points, or 0.90%, at 26,192.10, the S&P 500 was down 20.75 points, or 0.71%, at 2,902.98 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 61.97 points, or 0.77%, at 7,987.67. More than 350 of the S&P 500 companies have reported so far, and analysts now expect earnings to rise 0.7% compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Among gainers, Qualcomm Inc rose 0.9% after analysts said the chipmaker was well-positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 0.3%. Under Armour Inc gained 4.4% after the sportswear maker posted strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, benefiting from stronger demand in overseas markets. Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, slipped 4.7% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Kellogg Co dropped about 4% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a 36.5 percent decline in first-quarter earnings. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.35-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 50 new lows.

504,NYSE-owner ICE cool with crypto 'winter' as profits climb - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:25 PM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - The collapse in value of cryptocurrencies came at on opportune time for Intercontinental Exchange Inc, allowing the exchange operator to buy assets at a discount for its long-awaited crypto-trading platform affiliate Bakkt, the head of the company said on Thursday.  “It’s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter,” said ICE’s Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Sprecher, on a call with analysts after the company reported stronger-than-expected first quarter financial results. “That took some of the heat off of the timetable to launch.”  Bakkt has been in the works for two years and ICE, which also owns the New York Stock Exchange, announced its plans for the new company in August. But Bakkt, which is aimed at institutional investors and ties in with a proposed physically settled bitcoin futures contract to be launched on ICE’s U.S. futures exchange, had faced regulatory delays and still does not have a launch date. In late 2017, the price of bitcoin [BTC=BTSP] surged to nearly $20,000, prompting a flood of interest in it and other cryptocurrencies and a wave of new cryptocurrency-focused companies that attracted large valuations. But last year, the price collapsed by three quarters, initiating the so-called winter that sapped valuations and kept institutional investors largely at bay. During that lull ICE has been scooping up talent and building out Bakkt, including through acquisitions, said Sprecher. “We’ve actually looked at a number of different companies and acquired a company earlier this week that wouldn’t have been available to us if the market had been really hot,” he said.  ICE said on Monday it bought crypto-custody firm Digital Asset Custody Co for an undisclosed amount.     The Atlanta-based company said on Thursday that excluding one-time items, like M&A costs, it earned a profit of 92 cents per share in the first quarter, topping the mean of analysts expectations by 2 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. A 5 percent rise in revenue by ICE’s data unit, to $546 million, helped offset a softer trading environment which led to a 4 percent decline, to $862 million, in the company’s transaction and clearing unit. Net income attributable to the company rose to $484 million, or 85 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $464 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue, excluding transaction-based expenses, increased 3.7 percent to $1.27 billion.

505,"METALS-Zinc hits 1-1/2 month low, others recover on trade deal hopes - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  10:47 AM / in 5 days","3 Min Read* GRAPHIC-2019 asset returns: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl (Updates with closing prices) By Eric Onstad LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Zinc prices hit their lowest since mid-March on worries about global demand and as inventories climbed, but other metals were supported by hopes that a U.S.-China trade deal would be agreed. Investors have been worried after data on Tuesday showed factory growth in top metals consumer China slowed unexpectedly in April, with a survey on Thursday showing that Euro zone factory activity contracted for a third month. “I think it’s still premature to buy. The current picture is that the worst is over, but conditions remain weak in the global economy. We need to see some real improvement for metals prices to really find the bottom,” said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, partner at consultancy T-Commodity in Milan. “But in zinc and copper, supplies are still pretty tight, so I think that will keep us from seeing severe losses.” Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange fell 1.5 percent in closing open-outcry trading to $2,731 a tonne after touching $2,717, its lowest since March 11. Most industrial metals slumped on Wednesday as computer-driven funds sold after an options expiry, with aluminium and lead prices hitting their lowest in more than two years. * ZINC STOCKS: LME zinc inventories MZNSTX-TOTAL rose to 88,750 tonnes, the highest since Feb. 15 and up 70 percent over the past three weeks, LME data showed on Thursday.

506,"U.S. first-quarter productivity strongest since 2014, labor costs subdued - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  1:28 PM / in 5 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity increased at its fastest pace in more than four years in the first quarter, depressing labor costs and suggesting inflation could remain benign for a while. The report from the Labor Department on Thursday came on the heels of data this week showing moderate wage growth in the first quarter and a key inflation measure posting its smallest annual gain in 14 months in March. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady and signaled little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters the moderation in price pressures was likely due to transient factors, and predicted inflation would rise back to the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target. “The rebound in productivity is restraining labor costs and keeping inflation in check,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. “The improved production of workers more than offset the moderate gain in wages.” Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 3.6 percent annualized rate in the last quarter. That was the strongest pace since the third quarter of 2014. Data for the fourth quarter was revised down to show productivity rising at a pace of 1.3 percent instead of the previously reported 1.9 percent rate. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast first-quarter productivity would advance at a 2.2 percent rate. The acceleration in productivity was flagged by a surge in gross domestic product growth in the January-March period. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent rate in the first three months of the year after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. Some economists believed the surge in productivity was partly driven by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government, which led to hours worked in the first quarter rising at their slowest pace in more than three years.  As such, they continued to estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation between 1.7 percent and 2.0 percent.  “One quarter does not make a trend, and we do not expect productivity growth to be sustained at the current level, but a gradual shift towards 1.5-2.0 percent seems plausible to us,” said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in Washington. U.S. stocks were trading lower and yields on U.S. Treasuries were higher. The dollar rose slightly against a basket of currencies. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a rate of 2.4 percent, the best performance since the third quarter of 2010. The strong pace of productivity suppressed growth in labor costs, a boost for corporate profits.  Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 0.9 percent rate in the first quarter after increasing at a 2.5 percent rate in the prior quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 0.1 percent rate, the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2013.  The government reported earlier this week that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 1.6 percent in the year to March, the smallest rise since January 2018, from 1.7 percent in February. The so-called core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.  Other data this week showed wages and salaries rising 0.7 percent in the first quarter after gaining 0.6 percent in the prior period. Wage inflation remains moderate despite a tight labor market and anecdotal evidence of worker shortages. A second report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed     initial claims for state unemployment benefits were flat at a seasonally adjusted 230,000 for the week ended April 27, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims surged 37,000 in the prior week, which was the largest rise since September 2017.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 215,000 in the latest week. Claims have been volatile in recent weeks because of the different timings of the Easter and Passover holidays as well as school spring breaks. A strike by workers at Stop & Shop supermarkets in New England, which has since ended, likely contributed to the recent jump in claims.  Despite the recent increase in claims, the labor market remains strong, with Friday’s employment report for April expected to show another month of solid job growth.   According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 185,000 jobs in April after rising by 196,000 positions in March. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.8 percent in April. A third report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed factory orders rebounded 1.9 percent in March, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment as well as computers and electronic products. That was the largest rise since August 2018 and followed a 0.3 percent drop in February. Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul SimaoAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

507,UPDATE 1-South Africa says Chinese loan to Eskom not in jeopardy - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:03 PM / in 5 days","2 Min Read(Adds detail, context) JOHANNESBURG, May 2 (Reuters) - South Africa’s public enterprises ministry on Thursday said that a China Development Bank (CDB) loan to struggling state power company Eskom was not in jeopardy. Eskom had expected to draw down 7 billion rand ($481 million) from a $2.5 billion CDB loan facility by late March, but South Africa’s finance ministry said in a report to parliament last month that the drawdown had been delayed. The delay meant South Africa had to bring forward a planned bailout for Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the electricity in Africa’s most industrialised economy but has been grappling with a severe financial crisis. The South African government and Eskom are working to ensure the transfer of funds from CDB to Eskom, the public enterprises ministry said in a statement. “It must be emphasised, for the sake of clarity, that this, or any other loan, is in no way connected to the issue of equity in any of our state-owned enterprises,” the statement said. The Chinese loan to Eskom was agreed in July last year, during a visit to South Africa by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Eskom is battling with liquidity problems. The government has promised the utility a bailout of 23 billion rand a year over the next three years, but energy experts say it will need more support.

508,"U.S. ratchets up pressure on Venezuela, Cuban backers - Reuters","April 5, 2019 /  12:09 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadHOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday stepped up efforts to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from office by imposing new sanctions on its oil shipments, and promising “stronger action” against Cuba for helping to keep the regime afloat.  Greater efforts to prevent oil revenues from reaching Maduro, including sanctions on Venezuela’s finance and oil sectors, were coming, Pence said in Houston before a hand-picked audience of 300 people, many from the local Venezuelan community who support Maduro’s ouster. “The United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy” in Venezuela, Pence said at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, calling oil shipments “the lifeblood of that corrupt regime.”   The United States and leaders of most nations in the Western Hemisphere consider Maduro’s 2018 reelection illegitimate and have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the company’s interim president. Maduro dismisses Guaido as a U.S. puppet. After Pence’s speech, the U.S. Treasury announced sanctions on 34 vessels owned or operated by Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA that carry oil to customers outside the region. It also sanctioned two shipping operators and a vessel that delivered oil to Cuba in February and March. Pence bashed the island nation’s leaders as the “real imperialists” in the Western Hemisphere, adding: “The time has come to liberate Venezuela from Cuba.” An estimated 50,000 Venezuelans, the second-largest expatriate community outside of south Florida, live in Houston. Many of them support U.S. efforts to rid Venezuela of Maduro, having fled the socialist politics of former leader Hugo Chavez for a home in Houston’s energy industry. However, some Venezuelan expatriates in Houston believe tougher actions than Pence’s proposals on Friday were needed to replace the government.  “It’s going to take more than economic sanctions,” said Andres Carvallo, a former Venezuelan lawyer and journalist who attended the speech. In addition to sanctions, the United States should organize a military coalition of countries to remove the current government, he said.  Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan native and Latin American energy expert at Rice, said many expatriates had hoped that Pence would deliver a plan to get the Venezuelan military to stop supporting Maduro. “It doesn’t seem the military is willing to remove support from Maduro,” which has proven more difficult than opposition leaders had expected. “We want to see more than barking. We want to see action,” said Miguel Eljuri, a Venezuelan living in Houston who also once worked for PDVSA.  Maria Gonzalez, an economist who listened to the speech, welcomed tougher action, adding her mother in Venezuela lacks water, power and basic supplies. As for the Trump administration’s reversal of the U.S. opening to Cuba, she said: “they do not deserve our help.”   Reporting by Collin Eaton in Houston; editing by Gary McWilliams and Marguerita ChoyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

509,"Courting black voters, Bernie Sanders draws personal contrast with Trump - Reuters","April 5, 2019 /  5:00 PM / a month ago","5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, courting the black voters who did not support his 2016 White House run, drew a sharp personal contrast on Friday with what he called President Donald Trump’s racist policies. Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, told a crowd of African-American activists that his push for economic equality, including universal healthcare, free public college and a higher minimum wage, would help ease the country’s racial wealth gap. “Like many of you here, I have been fighting for economic, social and racial justice. As this presidential campaign begins, I believe that is the defining difference between President Trump and me,” Sanders said at the Reverend Al Sharpton’s National Action Network in New York. “Donald Trump is a man who has said he believes Nazis and white supremacists are ‘very fine people,’” Sanders said, a reference to Trump’s comments after violence at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. “I am the son of an immigrant whose family was murdered by the Nazis, and so, from a very young age, I knew that we must stand up to bigotry wherever it exists.” Sanders, whose father was an immigrant from Poland, struggled to win black support in his losing 2016 Democratic primary race against Hillary Clinton, who along with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had proven appeal to black voters. Since launching his 2020 presidential campaign, Sanders has made an effort to emphasize his history of civil rights activism and make an explicit case for how his economic policies would benefit African-Americans. At the conference, Sanders drew words of praise from Sharpton, who has said he will not endorse a Democratic candidate until later in the year. Sharpton reminded the crowd, however, of his breakfast in Harlem with Sanders at the height of the campaign for president in 2016. “I can say in the two years since, he has lived up to everything he has said to me and more. I want you to know he has done what he said,” Sharpton told the crowd. Sanders was one of seven Democrats who spoke to the conference on Friday. Five others in the growing Democratic 2020 White House field appeared at the conference earlier in the week. The candidates have backed an array of policies to close the racial gap in economic equality, improve access to healthcare and institute criminal justice reforms including eliminating cash bail, outlawing the death penalty, legalizing marijuana and wiping clean the records of non-violent drug offenders. Democrats in the 2020 race have intensified their outreach to black voters this year following the first decline in African-American turnout in 20 years during the 2016 election, which helped sink Hillary Clinton and contributed to Trump’s stunning upset victory. The historically diverse 2020 Democratic field includes black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates, as well as a record six women so far.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren raised the prospect in her speech of eliminating the Senate filibuster, the procedural rule that requires a 60-vote supermajority in the 100-member chamber, for legislation, saying it had been used through history to block civil rights and other bills. Democrats eliminated the filibuster for some executive branch and lower-level judicial appointments when they controlled the Senate under Democratic President Barack Obama.  Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has curtailed it further to apply to Supreme Court nominations. Eliminating the filibuster for legislation would be a significant escalation of the partisan battle that has raged in Congress in recent years. “For generations, the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. And in recent years, it’s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything,” Warren said. “When Democrats have the White House again, if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama, and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country, then we should get rid of the filibuster,” Warren told the conference.

510,"Fight begins over Trump's taxes, lawyer slams Democrats' request - Reuters","April 5, 2019 /  7:56 PM / a month ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - An attorney for President Donald Trump on Friday blasted U.S. House Democrats’ request for six years of Trump’s tax returns as “a misguided attempt” to politicize the tax laws, accusing lawmakers of harassment and interference in IRS audits. In a statement that mapped out the legal battlefield ahead, William Consovoy said the request, formally filed on Wednesday by U.S. House of Representatives tax committee Chairman Richard Neal, flouts “constitutional constraints.” “The requests for his private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits,” Consovoy said. “We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed,” he said. One of the many investigations targeting Trump on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. court system, the House Democrat’s probe into the president’s tax returns could pull back the curtain on his business empire and his reputation as a savvy dealmaker. Unlike previous presidents over recent decades, Trump has refused to make public past tax returns, while retaining ownership in many enterprises, ranging from golf courses and hotels to Trump Tower in New York City and his Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida. Concerns about possible conflicts of interest have simmered since Trump moved into the White House in January 2017, along with lingering questions from his presidential campaign about his net worth, tax profile and past financial dealings.      Seeking answers to such questions, Neal this week invoked a law that gives the head of the tax committee the power to ask the Internal Revenue Service for a president’s returns. He is seeking both Trump’s personal and business tax returns. Asked on Friday about Neal’s request, Trump said before leaving the White House for a trip to California, “From what I understand the law is 100 percent on my side.” Congressional Republicans oppose Neal’s effort, saying such a move sets a dangerous precedent by turning the confidential tax documents of a U.S. citizen into a political weapon. A tax committee spokesman said it had no comment for now. An IRS spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.  When Neal filed his request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig two days ago, Neal said it was “critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials.” Trump has long maintained that he cannot release his returns because they are under IRS audit. The IRS, which is overseen by the U.S. Treasury Department, has said that Trump could release his returns even while under audit. Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen recently testified in Congress that he did not believe the president was being audited, but may have used the audit claim to avoid scrutiny that could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties. In a letter to Treasury General Counsel Brent McIntosh on Friday, Consovoy called the request “a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.” He argued that any request from the House committee for private tax returns would need to have a legitimate legislative purpose, which he said Neal’s request lacked. Consovoy said the IRS should not comply with the request until it receives a formal legal opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. Consovoy is also Trump’s personal lawyer in a case accusing him of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution with his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., which is pending at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

513,COLUMN-Fed rate cut likely if U.S. manufacturing continues to slow: Kemp - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  1:43 PM / in 5 days","7 Min Read(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2WjnsKH By John Kemp LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers reported a further slowdown in growth last month. If the trend continues, it is likely the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the second half of the year as a precaution against recession. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.8 in April, down from 55.3 in March and only modestly above the 50-point threshold separating expanding activity from a contraction. The index has been on a downward trend since peaking in August 2018 and has now fallen to its lowest level since October 2016, according to the latest survey results published on Wednesday. In August, the index was in the 90th percentile for all months since 1950, pointing to a very broad-based and rapid expansion. By April, the index had fallen to the 44th percentile, indicating a significant slowdown. Manufacturers report new orders, production and employment are all growing more slowly, while inventories are increasing faster, and supplier deliveries are accelerating, all of which are consistent with slowing growth. The U.S. manufacturing sector typically cycles between periods of faster and slower growth, some of which become end-of-cycle recessions while others become mid-cycle slowdowns followed by renewed expansion. The manufacturing growth cycle is not regular, but it is somewhat predictable, and the acceleration and deceleration of activity is not random. The ISM index follows a fairly consistent oscillation. End-of-cycle recessions almost always prompt the Federal Reserve to cut overnight interest rates and take other steps to boost lending and ease financial conditions (tmsnrt.rs/2WjnsKH). The recession in 1980 was a rare exception, when the Fed raised rather than lowered interest rates, even as the economy slipped into recession, in an effort to reduce inflation. But mid-cycle slowdowns in manufacturing also usually result in a cut in policy-controlled interest rates or other monetary easing as the central bank attempts to fend off the risk of recession. Mid-cycle manufacturing slowdowns centred on April 1967, May 1985, January 1996 and December 1998 all coincided with reductions in the effective federal funds rate. Sometimes the central bank takes other measures rather cutting the federal funds target, for example adding to its portfolio of securities, changing its forward guidance, or easing other credit controls. The slowdown centred on August 1962 prompted the Fed to buy extra U.S. Treasury securities and ease margin requirements to boost lending and offset the sharp reduction in stock market credit (“Annual Report”, 1962). The slowdown centred on November 2012 encouraged the central bank to step up its quantitative easing programme by purchasing additional mortgage-backed securities (“FOMC statement”, September 2012). And the slowdown centred on January 2016 caused the central bank to soften its previous language about raising interest rates and replace it with a more gradual stance (“FOMC statement”, December 2015). Previous mid-cycle slowdowns were all somewhat worse than the current loss of momentum, with the ISM manufacturing index hitting a low to somewhere between 49.5 (the best case in August 1962) and 42.8 (the worst case in April 1967). In more recent decades, the ISM index has hit mid-cycle troughs at 47.1 (May 1985), 45.9 (February 1996), 46.8 (December 1998), 48.9 (November 2012) and 47.8 (January 2016). But if the index continues to decline at its recent rate it will cross the 50-point threshold sometime in the second or third quarter, boosting the probability the Fed will ease financial conditions in the second half of the year. Bond traders certainly think the probability of interest rate reductions or other monetary accommodation is increasing, with the U.S. Treasury yield curve for the second half of 2019 inverting again in recent days. For the time being, the Fed itself “continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the ... 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.” However, acknowledging downside risk, the central bank noted “global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures” and promised to be patient before adjusting rates (“FOMC statement”, May 2019). The recent decline in core measures of inflation would give the central bank scope to ease policy if it decided the risk of recession was rising. Many commentators, policymakers and traders have expressed confidence that the economy will re-accelerate later in the year, given strong growth in household incomes. If a comprehensive trade deal can be reached between the United States and China, that could reduce tariffs, boost business confidence and investment, and spur faster growth. Congress and the administration could also reach an agreement on a major infrastructure spending package that would aim, among other things, to boost domestic manufacturing and employment. Since the 1960s, however, there has never been a mid-cycle slowdown comparable to the current one when the Fed has not taken steps to ease financial conditions. Perhaps this time will be different. But if the slowing trend persists for the next 2-3 months, policymakers may conclude it is worth a small easing of financial conditions as an insurance policy against a recession. The Fed made the same calculation in 2012, 1998, 1995, 1985, 1967 and 1962. Faced with the same set of problems, policymakers are likely to react in the same way again.

521,Pompeo hopes North Korea's Kim does 'right thing' on nuclear weapons in parliament speech - Reuters,"April 5, 2019 /  4:34 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday he hoped North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a meeting of the country’s parliament next week to state publicly “it would be the right thing” for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.     North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly is due to hold its first meeting this year on Thursday and could feature the first public comments from Kim about a second summit between him and U.S. President Donald Trump Hanoi in February that collapsed. “It’s something that’s an annual event where the leader of North Korea speaks to his people,” Pompeo told “CBS This Morning.” “We’ll watch very closely what he says.”   “I don’t expect there’ll be great surprise,” Pompeo said, “but I do hope that he will share his sentiment, his sentiment that says: We – I believe, as the leader of North Korea, I believe the right thing to do is for us to engage with the United States to denuclearize our country.” Pompeo said U.S.-North Korea diplomatic channels remained open and the two sides have “had conversations after Hanoi about how to move forward,” but he did not elaborate. He said he was “confident” there would be a third summit between Trump and Kim but did not have a timetable although he hoped it would be soon. Pompeo stressed though that economic sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea gave up its nuclear weapons. Pompeo said on Monday he hoped the two leaders could meet again “in the coming months ... in a way that we can achieve a substantive first step or a substantive big step along the path to denuclearization.” The Hanoi summit, the second between Trump and Kim in less than a year, fell apart over a failure to reconcile North Korean demands for sanctions relief with U.S. demands for Kim to give up a nuclear weapons program that now threatens the United States. North Korea has warned since that it is considering suspending talks and may rethink a freeze on missile and nuclear tests, in place since 2017, unless Washington makes concessions. According to a document seen by Reuters last week, on the day their Hanoi talks collapsed, Trump handed Kim a piece of paper that included a blunt call for the transfer of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and bomb fuel to the United States. Analysts said the move was probably seen by the North Korean leader as insulting and provocative. Next week’s North Korean parliament session will coincide with a visit to Washington by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has pushed talks between the United States and North Korea in the past year and advocated sanctions relief. Pompeo told CBS that the United States and South Korea had “worked closely together to enforce ... sanctions.” Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Jeffrey BenkoeAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

522,"Biden, mulling White House run, seeks to stem fallout from women's complaints - Reuters","April 3, 2019 /  7:57 PM / in a month","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attempted on Wednesday to tamp down a controversy over allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, releasing a video in which he pledged to be “more mindful” of respecting “personal space.” The move marked the most extensive and personal effort yet by Biden to quell the furor ahead of a likely bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. An announcement is expected later this month.  In recent days, four women have said Biden made them feel uncomfortable when he touched them at political events in past years.  “The boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset and I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying,” Biden said in the two-minute video posted on Twitter. “I will be much more mindful, and that’s my responsibility,” he said. “I’ve worked my whole life to empower women. I’ve worked my whole life to prevent abuse.”  After a former Nevada politician, Lucy Flores, said last week that Biden made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused” when he kissed the back of her head at a 2014 campaign event, Biden released a statement saying he believed he never acted inappropriately during his many years in public life. Three more women followed suit with similar complaints. Biden’s political team has tried to contain the damage, encouraging women who have known him to come forward with positive accounts of their interactions with him. Flores could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. She supported U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2016 Democratic presidential campaign. Sanders is running again, and his campaign has denied any involvement in her going public with her story. There was no immediate response to Biden’s statement from leading Democratic contenders. U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O’Rourke, among others, have expressed sympathy for Biden’s accusers and have said they deserve to be heard.  President Donald Trump poked fun at Biden on Tuesday over the allegations. On Wednesday, the Republican president, who during his 2016 campaign faced multiple accusations from women of unwanted sexual contact, wished his potential rival luck, saying it was up to Biden to decide if he should apologize.   Biden, 76, has long been known for a warm and intimate campaign style. He served eight years as vice president under Democratic President Barack Obama after 36 years as a U.S. senator from Delaware. But his propensity for hugging and physical touching has come under new scrutiny in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp as awareness about sexual assault and harassment has grown and damaged the careers of dozens of men in politics and entertainment accused of sexual misconduct. Sources close to Biden told Reuters that preparations for a run had not been slowed by the controversy. “I don’t think there is anything to change the work we are doing,” one source connected to the putative campaign said.  Another source who has been in contact with Biden’s team said the flap over his personal conduct had been anticipated. Both sources asked not to be named in order to speak freely about the campaign. A top Biden donor, New York attorney James Kreindler, said his support of Biden had been unshaken by the controversy. Dick Harpootlian, a prominent lawyer in Democratic Party circles in South Carolina, added he did not think it would harm Biden’s bid. Public opinion polls have consistently shown Biden to be atop the 2020 field, which features more than a dozen candidates. There is yet to be any evidence that he has suffered lasting political damage from the accusations.  Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist in Chicago and former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, said Biden’s supporters were largely familiar with his public persona and unlikely to desert him over the issue. The challenge for Biden if he does mount a run, Sefl said, was to appeal to voters who may be more skeptical about his behavior. She suggested he place women in high-profile roles within his campaign as one way to send a signal he is adapting to the times. She also encouraged him to talk about his work supporting causes such as the Violence Against Women Act, which Biden sponsored while in the Senate. She recalled witnessing Biden speaking in support of the legislation as vice president. “He was as emotional as any woman in that room,” Sefl said. “I want to see that should he be a candidate.”  Reporting by James Oliphant and Ginger Gibson; Additional reporting by Alexandra Alper in Washington; Editing by Colleen Jenkins, Jonathan Oatis and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

523,U.S. aid helped Guatemalan farmers stay rooted to their lands - Reuters,"April 5, 2019 /  5:27 AM / in a month","6 Min ReadSANTA MARIA CHIQUIMULA, Guatemala (Reuters) - After a U.S.-funded program gave Guatemalan farmer Rigoberto Leon and his neighbors tools to plant new crops like tomatoes and chili peppers, many of them stayed to live off their drought-prone lands even as droves of villagers left for the United States.     More programs like the climate change adaptation scheme backed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that helped Leon are in jeopardy after U.S. President Donald Trump said he will end Washington’s aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. He has accused the Central American countries of failing to halt an influx of migrants to the United States.     Leon fears an aid cutoff would make it harder for farmers to survive in villages around the small indigenous Mayan town of Santa Maria Chiquimula, in Guatemala’s western highlands, which is suffering deforestation and low rainfall.     “Here, there’s no money to invest in materials, in what’s needed,” he said. “If there were more opportunities for work here, there would be no need to go to the United States.”     For decades, hundreds of programs throughout Central America have worked to slow the steady outflow of men - and increasingly, children and entire families - through efforts such as assisting farmers, educating teens, improving police and strengthening governance.     While these programs have not stopped the overall rise of migration, proponents of international aid say the situation would be worse without them and that the United States should invest more, not less.     U.S. assistance expanded under former President Barack Obama, whose administration sought to tackle root causes of immigration. In his last full fiscal year in office, funds appropriated for Central America hit a high of $754 million.     That aid has steadily decreased under Trump, however, to $700 million the first year and to $627 million in 2018.     Leon, who grows hundreds of pine tree seedlings in a greenhouse equipped with a sprinkler-based irrigation system, both donated by USAID, said the number of families he knew living off the dry hillside more than doubled to 40 as a result of the program, which ran from 2014 to 2017.     Local project organizers say they still receive bare-bones U.S. funding to organize training, but are lobbying for more in order to buy storage tanks and tubing to bring water from a nearby river.     The Mayan people suffer some of the highest poverty rates in Latin America. Guatemala’s paltry tax take and low public investment have contributed to worsening social indicators.     Sebastian Charchalac, an agricultural engineer who helped lead the climate change program, lamented that its funding evaporated after Trump took office, saying it could have been extended to additional locations. “The results are still very good, because they rooted people to their communities,” he said.     While data is not clear on which projects have been affected by the change in government, the Trump administration has signaled a desire to shift funding away from economic aid and climate change-oriented programs, in favor of security and policing.     USAID did not respond to a question about why funding was reduced for the Santa Maria program. Instead, it said it was evaluating the impact of Trump’s directive to end fiscal year 2017 foreign assistance funding.  Approximately $450 million in 2018 funds would be affected, they said. It is also unclear how much funding Trump can cut off without the support of Congress.     Rachael Shenyo, a former USAID coordinator in Guatemala who now runs climate change programs funded by non-profit groups and the private sector, said further reductions in U.S. assistance would create an opportunity for China.     Since 2017, El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic have all forged closer ties with Beijing, Washington’s strategic rival.     “China has been increasing its presence more or less across Latin America. You’re going to see a lot more investment,” Shenyo said.     SELF-SUFFICIENCY             Critics of foreign aid say it is not always effective, or helps only small numbers of people, while sometimes acting as a political tool and forcing an underdeveloped country to become dependent on a stronger one.     In El Salvador, where migration has been shrinking along with the homicide rate, President-Elect Nayib Bukele said he welcomes funding, but that he wants the country to ultimately stop relying on outside help.     “We Salvadorans should be self-sufficient,” he told reporters this week. “It’s somewhat a sense of low self-esteem to think that we can’t get ahead without humanitarian aid.”     U.S. help in El Salvador includes training police and developing strategy. Ever Manzano, the country’s police spokesman, said he did not think Trump’s vow to cut aid would materialize.     “They have a lot of interest and have had a big presence, substantial investment, and excellent relations with the police force,” he said.     U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said ending aid would make it harder for Trump to crack down on gangs and crime. During a visit last week to El Salvador, he visited a program that teaches software coding to teens to steer them from crime, and an FBI-backed anti-gang project.     “We’re cutting off our nose to spite our face. The very things (Trump’s) complaining about, will make it tougher for us to do,” said Engel.

Among the gainers were financial stocks, which rose 0.5%, helped by MetLife Inc. The insurer’s shares rose 3.9% after beating quarterly profit estimates, helped by strong underwriting, volume growth, as well as higher investment income. Qualcomm Inc rose 3.3% after analysts said the chipmaker was well-positioned in the 5G networks space even as it forecast disappointing current-quarter sales. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.9%. Despite gains in the sectors, the broader markets remained muted as quarterly earnings season tapers off. “Probably the market is not going to do much of anything and I say that because earnings are now winding down,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. The S&P 500 snapped a three-day streak of closing at record highs on Wednesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stuck with the monetary policy outlook, driving down bets of interest rate cut this year which emerged in the recent months amid worries of a recession. “Investors are going to dwell on the Powell’s comments. He said there is no need to cut rates anytime soon or indicated that next move might not be a rate cut.” Markets are awaiting a reading of the Labor Market’s non-farm payrolls data on Friday, which is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared to March. At 10:16 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.32 points, or 0.02%, at 26,435.46, the S&P 500 was up 5.88 points, or 0.20%, at 2,929.61 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 38.07 points, or 0.47%, at 8,087.71. Over halfway through earnings season, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to rise 0.5% compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Under Armour Inc gained 5.7%, topping the S&P 500, after the sportswear maker posted strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, benefiting from stronger demand in overseas markets. Among decliners, Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, slipped 1.6% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Kellogg Co dropped 4.3% after the cereal and snacks maker said it would replace its chief financial officer and reported a 36.5 percent decline in first-quarter earnings. Shares of Abiomed Inc slumped 7.8% after the medical device maker reported quarterly revenue below expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 7 new 52-week highs and five new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 34 new highs and 33 new lows.

528,Bank of England's Carney tells investors they are too relaxed on rates - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  11:18 AM / in 5 days","4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday investors were underestimating how much interest rates could rise, even as the British central bank kept borrowing costs on hold due to Brexit uncertainty. Sounding more hawkish than the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Carney warned investors they were being too relaxed about BoE plans to carry on easing Britain off its financial-crisis levels of near-zero borrowing costs. “There are insufficient hikes in the current market curve to be consistent with our remit,” he told reporters, referring to interest rate expectations embedded in financial market prices. But for now, the BoE said, there was little risk from waiting to see if Britain can leave the European Union later this year without a big shock to the economy. Its nine rate-setters all voted to keep its benchmark rate at 0.75 percent on Thursday, as expected in a Reuters poll. Britain’s economy has slowed since the Brexit referendum in 2016 but has fared better than many investors feared.  In some ways, it looks ready for what would be only its third interest rate hike in more than a decade. Unemployment is at a 44-year low, wages are growing at the fastest pace in 10 years and consumer spending remains solid. Carney said the Brexit uncertainty was keeping the appropriate level of interest rates artificially low for now. Markets paid little attention to his blunt message.  Sterling was hardly changed from before the BoE’s announcement and futures priced in less than a one-in-three chance of a rate hike this year - lower than what was factored in before Carney spoke. “Brexit is really painting the Bank of England into a corner at the moment,” said Luke Bartholomew, an investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “But there’s no escaping the fact that the data broadly points towards a rate hike in the not too distant future. If things keep going on at this rate then I think we’ll start to see calls from within the Bank for a hike.” The BoE raised its forecast for growth in the world’s fifth-largest economy to 1.5 percent, up from the decade-low 1.2 percent it predicted in February, thanks largely to better prospects for the global economy. During the first quarter of 2019 the British economy probably grew by a relatively strong 0.5 percent due to businesses building up stocks ahead of Brexit, the BoE said - faster than the 0.2 percent growth it forecast in February.  But growth was likely to slow to 0.2 percent in the current quarter, it added. The new Brexit deadline of Oct. 31, seven months later than originally planned, has removed the immediate risk of a no-deal exit from the EU which hung over the BoE at its last meeting in March, but extends a period of economic uncertainty. The BoE’s updated forecasts showed inflation - currently 1.9 percent - would exceed its 2 percent target in two and three years’ time by a similar margin to its February forecasts. Carney said the overshoot would have been visibly higher were it not for the fact that markets unusually indicate oil prices will fall over the coming years - something which has a mechanical downward effect on the BoE’s medium-term inflation forecasts. The forecasts also reflected financial market pricing which assumed the BoE would not raise interest rates to 1 percent until late 2021 - around 15 basis points less in tightening than was priced in just before February’s BoE meeting. Carney said this appeared primarily to reflect spillover from a softening in policy intentions by the Fed and ECB, rather than a change in the fundamentals of Britain’s economy.

531,Spain's Gbfoods nears deal with CVC to buy Continental Foods - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  1:46 PM / 5 days ago","1 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Spain’s Gbfoods, part of the family-owned Agrolimen group, has entered into exclusive final negotiations with private equity firm CVC to buy Continental Foods, the companies said on Thursday.  Gbfoods said it made a “firm offer” for the European  packaged soup and sauce maker which CVC bought from Campbell Soup in 2013.  The business, home to brands like Liebig in France and Erasco in Germany, has turnover of around 400 million euros  ($447 million) and more than 1,000 employees, the companies said.  Reuters reported last month that CVC was in talks to sell the business in a deal that could be worth around 1 billion euros, and said Agrolimen was the frontrunner.  GBFoods was advised by AZ Capital, PWC, and Clifford Chance, while CVC was advised by UBS, ING and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP.

532,UPDATE 1-Brazil manufacturing grows at slowest pace in 6 months - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  1:46 PM / in 5 days","2 Min Read(Adds detail, context, quote, byline) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, May 2 (Reuters) - Growth in Brazilian manufacturing activity slowed in April to its weakest pace in six months, data on Thursday showed, with the IHS Markit Brazil manufacturing purchasing managers index falling to 51.5 from 52.8 the month before. The figures are the latest to show that Latin America’s largest economy continues to struggle to gain any real traction, an indication that the second quarter will not be much better than the first. A reading above 50.0 marks expansion in the sector, while a reading below signifies contraction. While the sector grew for a 10th straight month, sales grew at the slowest rate since July and export orders fell for the fifth month in a row. “Faltering new order growth and lingering trade challenges created headwinds for Brazilian manufacturers at the start of the second quarter,” said Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit. “These setbacks hindered the ability of firms to sustain the solid increases in employment signaled at the start of the year. The latest upturn in jobs was marginal at best, having eased to the weakest in 2019 so far,” she said. Manufacturing represents only around 15 percent of Brazil’s annual economic output. Currency weakness failed to boost export demand in April, but did spur the fastest rate of input price inflation in six months, IHS Markit noted. The real currency has been hovering around 4.00 per dollar for weeks, and analysts have been paring back forecasts of how much they think it will rise this year. Still, Brazilian manufacturers are optimistic that product innovation, a recovery in exports and improved economic conditions will spur a rebound in activity. The degree of optimism was the second highest in the series history, IHS Markit said.

533,U.S. revokes ICC prosecutor's entry visa over Afghanistan investigation - Reuters,"April 4, 2019 /  7:52 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadTHE HAGUE (Reuters) - The United States has revoked the entry visa of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, her office said on Thursday, a response to her inquiry into possible war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month the U.S. would withdraw or deny visas to ICC staff investigating such allegations against U.S. forces or their allies . United Nations human rights experts called the reaction “improper interference” in the work of the world’s permanent war crimes court. It also drew criticism from within the European Union. “We can confirm that the U.S. authorities have revoked the prosecutor’s visa for entry into the U.S.,” Bensouda’s office told Reuters in an e-mail. It said it understood the move should not impact Bensouda’s travel to the U.S. to meet her United Nations obligations. The ICC is not a U.N. court, but Bensouda travels regularly to brief the U.N. Security Council on cases referred to The Hague by the UN body. A State Department spokesman said members of international organizations planning official travel to the U.N. could apply for diplomatic visas. “We recommend that applicants apply as early as possible to maximize the chances of being found eligible,” the spokesman said. The U.S. in not a member of the ICC, along with other major powers Russia and China. The office of the prosecutor said on Thursday that Bensouda would exercise her duties “without fear or favor”. She has been investigating alleged war crimes by all parties in the conflict in Afghanistan since November 2017, including the possible role of U.S. personnel in relation to the detention of suspects. ICC judges are still reviewing materials and have not yet handed down a decision on opening a formal investigation in Afghanistan. The ICC is a court of last resort with 122 member states. It acts only when countries within its jurisdiction are found to be unable or unwilling to seriously investigate war crimes, genocide or other serious atrocities.

534,"U.S. Senate confirms housing regulator overseeing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac - Reuters","April 4, 2019 /  7:26 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mark Calabria, who was confirmed by a vote of 52-44, steps into a critical role in housing finance as Washington is renewing its efforts to overhaul the current system. As FHFA director, Calabria will be charged with overseeing the two government-sponsored enterprises, which guarantee over half of the nation’s mortgages. The two have been held in government conservatorship since 2008, after the once-private entities had to be rescued from collapse during the subprime mortgage crisis. Calabria, a libertarian economist who has advocated for a minimal government role in the housing market, will now directly manage Fannie and Freddie. He previously served as Vice President Mike Pence’s chief economist. Both Democrats and Republicans agree the current system, with Fannie and Freddie on a federal lifeline, is unsustainable, but Congress has struggled for years to advance any comprehensive reforms. Lawmakers are currently soliciting input for future reforms in an effort to keeping housing affordable while reducing the footprint of Fannie and Freddie. In March, Trump signed an executive order directing the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development Departments to develop recommendations for overhauling the housing market.

The Republican president in February declared a national emergency at the border to secure the money that Congress refused to give him for the wall. “The President’s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds, an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority,” Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said in a statement. She said a congressional legal advisory group voted to authorize the lawsuit.  In a stinging rebuke, the Democratic-controlled House passed legislation to terminate the emergency Trump declared at the U.S.-Mexico border but Trump issued the first veto of his presidency in March to block that measure. “The House will once again defend our Democracy and our Constitution, this time in the courts,” Pelosi said in a statement. “No one is above the law or the Constitution, not even the President.” U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the president’s emergency declaration was legal.

537,Democrat Buttigieg says he no longer uses phrase 'all lives matter' - Reuters,"April 4, 2019 /  7:48 PM / in a month","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg said on Thursday that when he used the phrase “all lives matter” in a 2015 speech he did not understand it had been adopted by critics to devalue the Black Lives Matter movement. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and fast-rising 2020 White House candidate, told reporters he had not used the phrase again once he became aware it was sometimes used to undermine the Black Lives Matter movement to fight police violence and racism against African-Americans. “At that time, I was talking about a lot of issues around racial reconciliation in our community. What I did not understand at that time was that phrase ... was coming to be viewed as a sort of counter slogan to Black Lives Matter,” Buttigieg told reporters after appearing before a conference of black activists in New York. “Since learning about how that phrase was being used to push back on that activism, I’ve stopped using it in that context,” he said. Buttigieg, who reported earlier this week that he raised $7 million for his presidential bid during the first quarter of this year, used the phrase in a 2015 State of the City speech in South Bend, where he has been mayor since 2012. During the speech, he talked about the need to respect the risks taken by police officers and also recognize the need to overcome the biases implicit in the justice system. “We need to take both those things seriously, for the simple and profound reason that all lives matter,” he said in 2015, according to a transcript published by the South Bend Voice. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was criticized later in 2015 for using the phrase “all lives matter.” Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Florida, who last week declared his own bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, criticized Buttigieg on Thursday for his use of the “all lives matter” phrase. “‘Black lives matter’ doesn’t mean that all lives do not matter, rather it is a cry for equal treatment in the greater circle of justice for all Americans,” said Messam, who is African-American.

The benchmark S&P 500 index snapped a three-day streak of closing at record highs on Wednesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stuck with the rate outlook and said the relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary. The Fed signaled little appetite to adjust rates any time soon, taking heart in continued job gains and economic growth and the likelihood that weak inflation will edge higher. Traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures trimmed their bets that the central bank would cut rates before the end of the year. “Probably the market is not going to do much of anything and I say that because earnings are now winding down,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “Investors are going to dwell on Powell’s comments. He said there is no need to cut rates anytime soon or indicated that next move might not be a rate cut.” Over halfway through earnings season, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to rise 0.5% compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 14 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1 points, or 0.03% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.15%. Under Armour Inc gained 5.7% in premarket trading after the sportswear maker posted strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, benefiting from stronger demand in overseas markets. Set to weigh on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3M Co, which dropped 0.7% after the industrial conglomerate said it would buy privately held medical device maker Acelity Inc in a deal valued at $6.7 billion. Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, slipped 2% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Hanesbrands rose 4.5% after the innerwear maker delivered first-quarter profit and sales ahead of analysts’ estimates. Shares of Abiomed Inc slumped 19.3% after the medical device maker reported quarterly revenue below expectations. Data at 10 a.m. ET will likely show factory goods orders to have increased 1.5% in March after a fall of 0.5% in the month before. Some hope emerged on the trade front after reports that the United States and China may be nearing a deal that would roll back some of the U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.

545,MONEY MARKETS-Dollar LIBOR falls as Fed tweaks interest on U.S. reserves - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  12:48 PM / in 5 days","2 Min ReadMay 2 (Reuters) - What banks charge each other to borrow dollars for three months fell to its lowest level in over six months on Thursday in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower the interest it pays banks on excess reserves in a bid to stabilize money market conditions. The three-month London interbank offered rate declined to 2.56513%, which was the lowest since Oct. 31. LIBOR is the benchmark rate for $200 trillion worth of dollar-denominated financial products, mainly interest rate swaps and floating-rate loans. On Wednesday, the Fed as expected left its target range on short-term borrowing costs unchanged at 2.25-2.50%. It also trimmed the amount of interest it pays banks on excess reserves (IOER) to 2.35% from 2.40% in an effort to ensure its key overnight lending rate, the federal funds rate , remains within the current target band. The fed funds rate is the amount banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight, and is the rate the U.S. central bank targets as its main way of controlling other borrowing costs in the economy. The rate has been approaching the upper end of the target range in recent weeks, prompting an adjustment in the IOER for the first time without the Fed changing its overall rate regime. On Monday, the average or effective, fed funds rate’s premium above IOER increased to a record 5 basis points. Reporting by Richard Leong

Oil and metals markets added to the pressure on stocks as traders knocked copper to a 2-1/2 month low and used news of record U.S. oil production to cash in some of Brent’s near 33 percent rise this year. Europe’s basic resource stocks led the downward shuffle in equities with as much as a 1.4 percent drop to their lowest since late March. Tech took a similar hit although Wall Street futures were pointing to a fractionally positive. There was the Fed’s signals too. For all the intense political pressure to ease policy and the mixed growth/inflation data, the U.S. central bank held the line on Wednesday and refused to signal anything other than it was still on pause. The dollar index stuck near 97.600 against its set of major currency peers after going as high as 97.728. It hovered around $1.12 to the euro and 111.50 yen having eased back from last week’s four-month high of 112.39 yen. Although the Fed made the predicted 5 basis point cut to the interest it pays on banks’ excess reserves – a technical move to ease money market tightness as it runs down its balance sheet - chairman Jerome Powell was unwavering on the rate outlook and said the relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary. “The market has gotten perhaps ahead of itself in quite confidently pricing in (U.S) interest rate cuts,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. “Powell was quite dismissive of the latest downturn in inflation ... which I think has caused the market to reassess a little bit.” There was a little bit more movement from sterling as the Bank of England’s rate setters voted unanimously to keep rates on hold at 0.75 percent but stuck to the view that higher borrowing costs would be needed in future, a more hawkish stance than either the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. The BoE also upgraded its forecast for growth in the world’s fifth-largest economy to 1.5 percent, up from the decade-low 1.2 percent it predicted in February, all of which kept sterling in a 30 tick range around $1.3050. “It seems like Carney, along with everyone else, is waiting for more clarity on when and if the UK is leaving the European Union,” said Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer of Close Brothers Asset Management. Core European government bond yields also had a mixed day, first tracking the overnight rise in U.S. Treasuries after the Fed but eventually drifting back again. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index snapped a three-day streak of record high closes on Wednesday but were looking to respond with a positive start amid another flurry of earnings led by chip maker Qualcomm and sportswear firm Under Armour. In what is one of the season’s busiest weeks, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to rise 0.5 percent compared with a 2 percent fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Asia trading had been thinned by holidays in Japan and China but Hong Kong and Korea’s stocks gained after CNBC reported the U.S. and China could announce a long-awaited trade deal by May 10, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He heads to Washington. Though now expected by markets if confirmed, it would remove significant uncertainty that has weighed on markets and global data for a year now. “I would still expect some relief rally once the deal gets done. The question is how big that move might be,” State Street GM’s Metcalfe added. Elsewhere Turkey’s lira remained just about clear of 6 per dollar mark after data there showed manufacturing activity contracting for the 13th month in a row. Euro zone factory activity also contracted for a third straight month. “Demand shortages were again evident in the Turkish manufacturing sector in April, while currency weakness led to inflationary pressures building again,” said Andrew Harker, associate director of IHS Markit. In commodities markets, the drop in oil prices came after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was last off 27 cents at $63.32 a barrel while Brent slipped 33 cents to $71.86. Copper was at a two month low after a heavy tumble on Wednesday, while spot gold was marginally weaker at $1,271.55 an ounce. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan; Editing by Janet

547,Top Lebanese banker warns against raising interest income tax - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  12:31 PM / in 5 days","3 Min ReadBEIRUT, May 2 (Reuters) - A top Lebanese banker warned on Thursday that a proposed hike in the tax on interest income would affect capital flows to Lebanon, weaken banks’ ability to play their financing role in the economy, and obstruct growth. The Lebanese government is currently discussing a draft 2019 budget that would raise the tax paid on deposit interest income to 10 percent from 7 percent. Interest income had been tax free until the levy was introduced last year. Lebanon is saddled with one of the heaviest public debt burdens in the world and Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri’s government has vowed to enact long-delayed reforms to put state finances on a sustainable path. Joseph Torbey, chairman of the Association of Banks in Lebanon, said Lebanese banks hope to see the government succeed in agreeing an austerity budget, calling for a “fundamental reduction” in spending. But, addressing a Beirut economic conference, Torbey warned against underestimating the impact of “subjecting the banking system and its deposits to seasonal taxes at every opportunity - as happened last year” - a reference to the new levy in 2018. This “may be repeated today through raising the tax rate on deposit interest to 10 percent, affecting capital flows to Lebanon, weakening the ability of the banking sector to play its its financing role, negatively affecting interest rates and the cost of financing the Lebanese economy, and obstructing growth”. Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil told Reuters the draft budget projects a deficit of less than 9 percent of GDP compared to 11.2 percent in 2019. The budget, seen as a critical test of Lebanon’s will to reform, is based on an economic growth forecast of 1.5 percent in 2019, which could rise to around 2 percent as the economy picks up, Khalil said. Lebanon’s public debt issome 150 percent of GDP. State finances are strained by a bloated public sector, high debt servicing costs and hefty subsidies spent on the power sector. Serious steps toward reform could unlock $11 billion in financing pledged at a donor conference last year to help Lebanon build infrastructure to boost economic growth.

548,PRECIOUS-Gold falls to 1-week low after Fed dashes rate cut hopes - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  10:46 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read* Federal Reserve holds interest rates steady * Platinum touches lowest in a month * Silver hovers close to a more than four month low * Markets eye U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday (Updates prices) By K. Sathya Narayanan May 2 (Reuters) - Gold fell to its lowest in a week on Thursday, as the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) doused expectations of a near-term rate cut and on lack of physical demand in Asia. Spot gold was down 0.5 percent to $1,270.49 per ounce as of 1202 GMT. It fell to $1,269.69, its lowest since April 24, earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures fell 0.9 percent to $1,272.70 an ounce. “The (gold) market is under pressure after a lack of follow through on the upside as prices could not break above $1,290 after several attempts and there was nothing important out of the FOMC,” said Afshin Nabavi, senior vice president at MKS SA. In line with the expectations of most market participants, the Fed left benchmark interest rates unchanged on Wednesday. However, investors were taken by surprise when the U.S. central bank emphasised it saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut any time soon, citing rising employment and economic growth. Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and can boost the U.S. dollar, making gold costlier for investors holding other currencies. “Also, the Far East market is pretty much closed with Japan and China almost gone for the whole week and we are not seeing a lot of demand from that part of the world,” Nabavi added. The two major centres are shut for holidays. Trading in China will resume on Monday and in Japan on Tuesday. Gold fell about 0.5 percent in the previous session, its biggest one-day percentage decline since April 16, after the Fed’s statement boosted the dollar and U.S. treasury yields. The dollar on Thursday was down about 0.1 percent against its main rivals. “Gold is under pressure again, despite the dollar actually paring gains, which could be some insight into traders’ mentality,” OANDA Senior Market Analyst Craig Erlam said in a note. “Gold was threatening to potentially make a comeback but price action over the last 24 hours hasn’t given bulls much cause for optimism, which looks to have taken its toll.” Investors are keeping a close eye on U.S. non-farm payrolls data due on Friday. Silver was down 0.1 percent at $14.66 an ounce, holding close to a more than four-month low touched on Wednesday. Platinum slipped 0.9 percent to $856.34, after touching its lowest in a month. Palladium gained 0.1 percent to $1,353.60, having touched its lowest since Jan. 25 at $1,309.67 in the previous session. (Reporting by K.

549,Facebook's Zuckerberg confident of stopping interference in 2020 campaign - Reuters,"April 4, 2019 /  1:13 PM / a month ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Facebook Inc’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is confident the world’s biggest social network will do better in 2020 at stopping “bad actors” from manipulating the U.S. presidential election. “We’ve learned a lot since 2016, where, obviously, we were behind where we needed to be on defenses for nation states trying to interfere,” he said in a “Good Morning America” interview released on Thursday. “These aren’t things that you ever fully solve, right? They’re ongoing arms races, where we need to make sure that our systems stay ahead of the sophisticated bad actors, who are just always going to try to game them.”  U.S. intelligence agencies say there was an extensive Russian cyber-influence operation during the 2016 campaign aimed at helping Donald Trump, a Republican, defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations. Zuckerberg said here the social media giant had implemented a lot of different measures since 2016 to verify any advertiser who is running a political ad and create an archive so anyone could see what advertisers are running, who they are targeting and how much they are paying. Advertising practices at Facebook, the world’s largest social network with 2.7 billion users and $56 billion in annual revenue, have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data. The company said in a congressional testimony last year that Russian agents created 129 events on the network during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, shedding more light on Russia’s purported disinformation drive aimed at voters. “At this point, (we) have probably some of the most-advanced systems of any company or government in the world for preventing the kind of tactics that Russia and now other countries, as well, have tried,” Zuckerberg said. Asked if he could guarantee that there would not be interference in the election, Zuckerberg said, “What I can guarantee is that they’re definitely going to try.” Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun KoyyurAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

550,San Diego County sues Trump administration over immigration policy - Reuters,"April 4, 2019 /  9:57 AM / a month ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - San Diego County has filed a federal lawsuit against the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing it of leaving thousands of asylum seekers stranded without help and straining county resources, officials said on Wednesday. The suit, filed by the county’s Board of Supervisors in the U.S. Distict Court in Southern California, asks a judge to issue an injunction ordering the federal government to resume its “Safe Release” program which ended in October. The program had helped people seeking asylum reach relatives in the U.S. or connect with charities dedicated to helping migrants.  “The county formally filed a lawsuit this afternoon over this issue,” board Chairwoman Dianne Jacob wrote on Twitter. The county has already spent over 1.3 million dollars operating a downtown shelter to accommodate asylum seekers, she wrote. “That figure is ballooning by the day.” Immigration along the U.S. border with Mexico has been a key issue for the Trump administration, where the president has said he wants to curb undocumented migrants from entering the U.S. Jacob wrote on Twitter that the president’s policy had left border communities and local taxpayers “holding the bag.” Board member Nathan Fletcher told the Washington Post that 11,000 asylum seekers have come through the local shelters since November. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen was named in the suit along with senior officials in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol, the Post reported. Neither immigration officials or a representative for the Trump administration could be reached early Thursday for comment.

551,"Senator Michael Bennet says has cancer, will have surgery - Reuters","April 4, 2019 /  3:51 AM / a month ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - United States Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, previously  mentioned as a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said on Wednesday that he will undergo surgery for prostate cancer during the upcoming legislative break. “Late last month, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. While hearing news like this is never easy, I am fortunate it was detected early, and as a result, my prognosis is good,” Bennet, a Democrat, said in a brief statement released by his office. “During the upcoming Senate recess, I will have surgery in Colorado and return to work following a brief recovery,” Bennet said in the statement. An adviser to Bennet told the Denver Post newspaper last month that the 54-year-old former Clinton Administration official had not made a final decision about whether to join the already crowded field seeking his party’s presidential nomination. Already more than a dozen candidates have jumped into the race, including Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. Several others, including former vice president Joe Biden, are said to be making preparations for a run.  Bennet was appointed to the Senate in 2009 after his predecessor, Ken Salazar, was named secretary of the interior by President Barack Obama. Bennet, whose father Douglas was a U.S. State Department official, was elected to his first full term in the Senate in 2010. He won re-election in 2016.

552,EU plans sharp hike in U.S. energy imports as trade lever - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  8:27 AM / in 5 days","3 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will seek to double imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States by 2023, as part of its efforts to ease transatlantic trade tensions and reduce its reliance on Russian gas. The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28-nation bloc, said on Thursday it plans to increase imports to 8 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, more than double the level of 2018. U.S. President Donald Trump agreed with European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker last July not to impose tariffs on EU cars as the two sides sought to improve economic ties, including a drive to increase imports of U.S. LNG.  The Commission said in a statement that U.S. LNG imports had risen by 272 percent since then, compared with the similar year-earlier period, with more than 1.4 bcm in March alone. “The European Union is ready to facilitate more imports of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., if the market conditions are right and prices competitive,” the EU executive said. The EU has long worked to diversify from relying on Russia for almost 40 percent of its gas needs by developing LNG infrastructure to access other suppliers. Qatar and Australia are other major LNG suppliers. However, EU officials have stressed that the extent to which LNG imports can win market share will depend on market forces. Imports from the United States have surged over the European winter because of mild weather in Asia, pulling prices down to around $5 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu), in line with prices of gas from pipelines. The Asian price had been some $12 per MMBtu a year earlier. EU Energy Commissioner Miguel Canete and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry kicked off an EU-U.S. energy conference in Brussels on Thursday, featuring many industry executives. Canete told a news conference European capacity to import LNG was increasing, expansion planned in Poland, a Turkish plant operational soon and a planned German site and the bloc was committed to invest in pipelines to allow LNG to flow to more parts of the continent.     Perry said that Moscow’s cut of supply to Ukraine in the winters of 2006 and 2009 showed that price should not be the only consideration. “You get what you pay for,” Perry said. “The point is the same with Russian gas. If you ask our friends from Ukraine, they might tell you that the availability, the reliability might not be there.”   Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Elaine HardcastleAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

553,US STOCKS-Futures eke out gains as investors look past Fed decision - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  11:36 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Futures up: Dow 0.07%, S&P 0.18%, Nasdaq 0.29% By Shreyashi   Sanyal May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were modestly higher on Thursday, as investors looked past the Federal Reserve’s patient stance on monetary policy and awaited more earnings reports. The benchmark S&P 500 index snapped a three-day streak of record high closes on Wednesday as comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to dampen expectations of an interest rate cut this year. The Fed signaled little appetite to adjust rates any time soon, taking heart in continued job gains and economic growth and the likelihood that weak inflation will edge higher. Traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures trimmed bets the central bank would cut rates before the end of the year. Investors were occupied by corporate earnings, in what is one of the season’s busiest weeks. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to rise 0.5% compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. At 7:16 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 18 points, or 0.07%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 5.25 points, or 0.18% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 22.5 points, or 0.29%. In premarket trading, Under Armour Inc gained 4.1% after the sportswear maker raised its full-year profit forecast after posting strong quarterly earnings, benefiting from stronger demand from outside the United States. Qualcomm Inc dropped 1% after the chipmaker blamed economic weakness in China for lower-than-expected third-quarter sales forecast. Its stock has shot up about 50% since mid-April after the company won a legal dispute with Apple Inc, which allowed it to resume supplying chips for iPhones. Square Inc fell 5.9% after the payments processor reported disappointing payment volume numbers in the first quarter even as results beat estimates. HollyFrontier Corp rose 1.5% in light volumes, after the oil refiner topped profit expectations, as lower costs offset slightly weaker refining margins. Data at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show a drop in initial jobless claims for the week ended April 27 from the week before. Another set at 10 a.m. ET will likely show factory goods orders to have increased 1.5% in March after a fall of 0.5% in the month before. Some hope emerged on the trade front after reports that the United States and China may be nearing a deal that would roll back some of the U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.

The central bank governor said on Tuesday interest rate hikes remained an option if inflation unexpectedly jumps and defended the bank’s reserves policy against concerns that have grown as the lira tumbled in recent weeks. At its policy-setting meeting last week, the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 24 percent. Annual inflation is currently near 20 percent. Erdogan is a regular critic of high interest rates, calling for lower borrowing costs to boost economic activity. The lira, which has weakened 11 percent against the dollar this year, was steady at 5.9675 against the U.S. currency on Thursday. The main share index was down 0.51 percent. A currency crisis last year, fueled in part by concerns over political pressure on monetary policy, wiped nearly 30 percent off the value of the lira and helped tip the economy into recession.

561,Brazil farm credit uncertainty could hurt machine sales - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  10:01 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min ReadRIBEIRAO PRETO, Brazil, May 2 (Reuters) - Uncertainty surrounding Brazil’s new farm credit package is worrying executives from the world’s largest agricultural machine makers since a delay on the definition of the program could hurt their sales. Despite a relatively positive outlook for the Brazilian agricultural sector—as the country harvests its second largest soybean crop and a record corn crop—directors for John Deere , Case IH and AGCO Corp are anxious about new financing rules as Brazil’s new administration vows to cut public funding to the private sector. Brazil’s government has for years subsidized interest rates on loans for farmers, due to a history of high interests in the country. The federal government pays banks the difference between the conditions it sets for farmers in the annual farm credit package and those of the market. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, the main policy maker of President Jair Bolsonaro, advocates for a gradual increase on private financing for the agricultural sector. “I think this liberal vision is important for the country. But we need a period of transition, of accommodation,” Rodrigo Bonato, Brazil sales director for John Deere, told Reuters at the Agrishow, Latin America’s largest farm equipment exposition. “This lack of information regarding the new plan causes anxiety among farmers, it disturbs their decision making,” he said, adding that this is time of year when Brazilian farmers typically plan for their next crops. Brazil’s official credit line for agricultural machines, for example, has annual interests of 7.5 percent and 7 years for repayment. A private line at a commercial bank would normally costs 11 percent, with repayment in 5 years. “Interests are critical when a farmer calculates return on investments such as buying a large machine. A line with 11 percent is still too high, and I believe the government understands this structural difficulty,” said Christian Gonzalez, vice-president South America for Case IH, the agricultural machine arm of CNH Industrial. Luís Felli, South America head for AGCO Corp, said farmers have basically spent all the available credit from the last official financing package and are waiting to check the conditions of the new program before planning their investments. The government normally announces the measures before the Agrishow, as many farmers travel to the fair to see new releases and sometimes close deals already using the government-sponsored lines.

563,Some in Mueller's team see report as more damaging to Trump than Barr summary: NY Times - Reuters,"April 4, 2019 /  12:40 AM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have told associates that the findings of their probe are more damaging for President Donald Trump than Attorney General William Barr indicated in his four-page summary, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. Citing government officials and others familiar with the situation, the Times said some members of Mueller’s team believe Barr should have included more of their material in the summary he released on March 24 of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.  The Times said the officials and other sources declined to flesh out why some of the special counsel’s investigators viewed their findings as potentially more damaging for the president than Barr explained. It was also not clear how widespread among Mueller’s team, which included dozens of lawyers and investigators, are concerns about differences between Barr’s summary and Mueller’s report, the Times said. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Barr, a Trump appointee, said in the summary that Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia during the election. Barr also said the special counsel did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice. Barr himself subsequently concluded that Mueller’s inquiry had not found sufficient evidence to warrant criminal obstruction charges against Trump. Trump and the White House have hailed the conclusions as a victory for the president, who has denied conspiring with Russians or obstructing justice. The attorney general has pledged to release the nearly 400-page report by mid-April with certain portions blacked out for reasons such as protecting secret grand jury information and intelligence-gathering sources and methods. The Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to enable its chairman, Jerrold Nadler, to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain Mueller’s unredacted report and all underlying evidence as well as documents and testimony from five former Trump aides, including political strategist Steve Bannon.

564,Wall-weary U.S. Republicans pivot toward immigrant deportations - Reuters,"April 3, 2019 /  2:02 PM / in a month","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration and Republicans in the U.S. Congress, unable to fully fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall, are refocusing their immigration agenda on a proposal for simpler, faster deportations of undocumented children and families from Central America. In an effort that is sure to encounter resistance from Democrats, Republicans want to make deporting people from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras as swift and easy as it already is to deport undocumented people from Mexico or Canada, according to lawmakers and immigrant advocates. Doing so would mean changing U.S. asylum law in a profound way, according to immigrant advocates, who warned the Republican plan could result in persecuted children being sent back to their dangerous Central American homelands. On its own, such a deportation crackdown would likely stumble in Congress due to Democratic opposition, but it might advance if it were paired with another measure that Democrats favor, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, on Wednesday. “I have to give them something they want,” Graham said in an interview, referring to the Democrats. He said he would move quickly on legislation once the Department of Homeland Security tells him exactly what it wants, “and then let the negotiations begin.” Any deportation crackdown would mark President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to expel undocumented Central American immigrants, who are arriving at the U.S. border in rising numbers, and to discourage others from coming to United States. On Wednesday, Trump tweeted: “Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action, Border, or large sections of Border, will close. This is a National Emergency!” One of the “loopholes” he referred to has to do with asylum. At present, undocumented immigrants, including children unaccompanied by parents, can seek U.S. asylum if they come from countries whose governments cannot protect them from persecution. That standard applies to Central Americans, but it is not as stringent for Mexicans and Canadians, who can quickly and easily be deported by U.S. officials. The Trump administration wants to align treatment of Central Americans seeking asylum with that of Canadians and Mexicans. That would “allow the deportation of unaccompanied children before they’ve had a fair chance to claim protection,” Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense, a group that advocates for immigrant children, told a conference call with reporters. Young said the Republican approach could result in youths being sent back to their homelands, which they would likely only flee again. But Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, also a Republican, said in a brief interview: “What we need to do is we need to change our laws that are incentivizing and rewarding unaccompanied children and family units coming to this country because once they’re here, they stay.” Last Thursday, in a letter to Congress, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said, “Most immediately, we need the authority to treat all arriving migrant children equally.” She added that she would soon submit legislation to Congress to carry this out. On Friday, without giving details, she issued a statement that said, “DHS will need emergency legislative action to restore order” on the border with Mexico. No legislation has been publicly unveiled by Republicans, whose clout in Congress is limited now that Democrats control the House of Representatives and retain enough votes in the Senate to block most legislation. Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have spoken out against his recent threats to close the Mexican border and his announcement last weekend of plans to terminate U.S. aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. At the same time, the president’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border in order to help seize funds to build a wall to repel immigrants is tied up in federal courts. Trump has repeatedly threatened to close the border to stem what he calls a tide of illegal immigration. On Friday, he said he would close the border this week unless Mexico took steps to stop illegal migration.

565,Factories on the mend in April but still struggling - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:17 AM / in 5 days","5 Min ReadLONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global factory activity recovered a little last month but still appeared to be in the doldrums as demand remained weak and trade protectionism concerns prominent, while stimulus measures had yet to fully kick in. In the euro zone, business survey data on Thursday pointed to a third straight month of contraction and while manufacturing is still growing in the United States, it missed expectations by a wide margin on Wednesday. The picture was similarly gloomy across much of Asia.  That left the outlook for central banks predominantly skewed towards either easing - or at least not tightening - policy. Malaysia and New Zealand are prime candidates for potential rate cuts, and monetary authorities in Australia are facing growing calls to do likewise.  The Bank of England, meeting on Thursday, is almost certain to remain on hold but keep its options open for later in the year, in what will be its first policy decision since the postponement until Oct. 31 of Britain’s scheduled departure from the European Union. As the euro zone’s economic prospects have dimmed - in part due to a lack of clarity over Brexit - expectations for interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank have been pushed further into next year. [ECILT/EU] The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady overnight, saying it saw no strong case for either hiking or cutting, disappointing U.S. stock markets. “We see the May meeting as more evidence that this pause has legs. We continue to expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged through this year and next,” BNP Paribas economists told clients.  A resolution in the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing would go a long way towards improving the mood. While there is still great uncertainty, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries completed productive talks on Wednesday and were nearing a deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing in March announced additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while bank lending in the first quarter hit a record 5.81 trillion yuan ($863 billion).     The People’s Bank of China has also been cutting banks’ reserve requirements and keeping short-term money market rates low.  Purchasing Managers’ Indexes showed manufacturing activity shrank again in the euro zone, and that the boost to British factories from record rates of pre-Brexit stockpiling slowed in April. [EUR/PMIM][GB/PMIM] Uncertainty over the terms of Britain’s EU departure, long scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts and materials at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys. The same factor affected the rest of Europe. Activity in the continent’s manufacturing powerhouse Germany shrank for a fourth month running and in Italy it contracted for a seventh month. It accelerated in Spain but only stabilized in France. In China, both official and private factory surveys suggested an unexpected loss of momentum last month, though overall activity still expanded, albeit at a more subdued rate.  While many analysts agree the worst may be over for the world’s second-largest economy, the disappointing readings - which followed surprisingly upbeat March data - suggested it is still struggling for traction. April’s downbeat reading, coupled with a soft outlook for trade, have raised questions over how much more stimulus is needed to generate sustainable growth in China without risking a sharper jump in debt. “These uncertainties make us strongly believe that the Chinese government will continue its fiscal stimulus ... and will provide enough credit to smaller private firms to keep them running and stabilize the job market,” said ING’s Greater China economist Iris Pang. As China has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years, financial markets have been counting on another strong, credit-fueled bounce. “We’re starting to see a bottoming-out of the slowdown,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. “But bottoming out doesn’t mean that economies are firing away. We still think in some economies further support will be very helpful.”. Activity contracted in Malaysia and Taiwan and slowed in the Philippines and Indonesia. India’s expanded at its slowest pace in eight months while South Korea snapped a five-month streak of contractions. Japan releases PMI data next week due to public holidays.

567,FOREX-Firm data pushes euro higher; dlr resumes fall - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  9:26 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The dollar resumed its decline on Thursday, shrugging off Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s relatively confident comments on the U.S. economy as survey figures suggested fears of a broadening economic weakness in Europe could be exaggerated. The single currency popped a fifth of a percent higher after German retail sales contracted by less than expected while a swathe of PMI surveys from Germany to Spain was broadly within expectations. and “The data showed that manufacturing PMI data last month may have overstated the weakness in Europe and that might end up supporting the euro around current levels,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets at MUFG based in London. The euro gained a fifth of a percent to $1.1219 but was still within sight of a two-year low of $1.1110 hit last week. Weak manufacturing survey data and cautious comments from European Central Bank policymakers in April prompted investors to amass large short positions to the tune of a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. The euro’s tiny gains in quiet trading were in contrast to overnight volatility in the greenback after a surprisingly sharp retreat in the ISM index of manufacturing and downgrades to the U.S. inflation outlook prompted investors to sell the U.S. currency and push Treasury yields lower. It subsequently recovered when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the factors dragging on inflation might be “transitory” and he saw no case for a rate move in either direction. As a result, the dollar was half a percent above overnight lows against a basket of its rivals while 10-year Treasury yields were seven basis points above overnight lows. “Powell is seeing the glass half full,” said Konstantinos Anthis, Dubai-based head of research at ADSS. “What’s more important though is that he made it clear that he sees no case for easing interest rates, which of course will not make President Trump happy at all.” Still, interest rate futures markets are pricing in a 64 percent probability of a rate cut by the end of the year though that probability might change after monthly jobs data due on Friday and U.S. inflation data next week. Sterling held below a two-week high on Wednesday on speculation that Brexit talks between the British government and the main opposition party were making some progress. The pound was last at $1.3054, having been as high as $1.3101 overnight ahead of a Bank of England rate decision where the central bank is widely expected to hold fire but its comments might shift future rate expectations.

568,"UPDATE 1-Lebanese pound is and will remain stable, central bank head says - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  9:21 AM / 5 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds Salameh quote, background) BEIRUT, May 2 (Reuters) - The Lebanese pound is stable and will remain so, central bank Governor Riad Salameh said on Thursday after meeting President Michel Aoun, according to a statement sent by the Lebanese Presidency. “The Lebanese lira (pound) is stable and will remain stable and the central bank will support housing loans and (loans) for the productive sectors,” Salameh said at the presidential palace in Baabda. The Lebanese pound has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at its current level for more than two decades. Lebanon has one of the world’s heaviest public debt burdens, and its finance minister has said he will introduce “wide reductions” in spending. “We hope the budget will be at the level which the market hopes for,” the statement quoted Salameh as saying. He said he had confirmed to Aoun that the pound was sound and stable, and that the bank had all the capacity needed to keep it so. Lebanon’s net foreign assets stand at $38.56 billion. It has public debt equivalent to about 150 percent of gross domestic product. Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, whose coalition government is preparing a state budget expected to include spending cuts, last month said he wanted “to protect the pound”.

Powell’s comments on Wednesday led foreign-exchange markets to dial back some of their bets that U.S. rates would fall by the end of the year. His remarks came after Wednesday’s Fed meeting left rates unchanged, as expected. “Last night was a bit of a hawkish twist — the idea that Powell saw downward inflationary pressure as a transitory effect definitely caught markets by surprise,” said Simon Harvey, an analyst at Monex Europe. MSCI’s index of emerging-market currencies dipped 0.1 percent. Its developing-world stock index moved as far in the other direction. South Africa’s rand weakened while South African stocks rose 0.3 percent on gains among health care stocks and financials. Turkey’s lira was down 0.1 percent and on course for its lowest close in nearly seven months. Turkish stocks rose 0.6 percent, mainly on gains by financials and industrials. India’s rupee rose, helped by a half-percent fall in Brent futures. . India is a net oil importer. Russia’s rouble softened 0.4 percent, while equities gained 0.6 percent, with Sberbank’s common shares rising about 1 percent. Hong Kong stocks rose 0.8 percent. Mainland China’s markets were closed for the Labour Day holiday. In emerging Europe, the Czech crown slipped 0.1 percent against the euro, after a report that local manufacturing sentiment in April was the weakest since 2012. The Czech central bank is expected to raise its main interest rate to 2 percent later in the day, ending a recent pause in a two-year tightening cycle undertaken to tame domestic inflation pressures. Czech stocks rose 0.8 percent as they recovered from Tuesday’s close, the lowest in a month and a half. That loss came amid talk about introducing new taxes.

Oil and metals markets added to the pressure on stocks on Thursday with traders sending copper to a 2-month low and using news of record U.S. oil production to cash in some of Brent crude’s near 33 percent rise this year. Europe’s basic resource stocks led the downward shift in equities with a 1.4 percent drop to their lowest since late March. Continental Europe was also trying to get back up to speed having been shut for holidays on Wednesday. There was the Fed’s signals too. For all the intense political pressure to ease policy and the mixed growth/inflation data, the U.S. central bank held the line on Wednesday and refused to signal anything other than it was still on pause. The dollar index drifted around 97.600 against its set of major currency peers after going as high as 97.728 and hovering around $1.1211 to the euro and $1.30 to Britain’s pound with the Bank of England set to keep its rates on hold later. Although the Fed made the predicted 5 basis point cut to the interest it pays on banks’ excess reserves – a technical move to ease money market tightness as it runs down its balance sheet - chairman Jerome Powell was unwavering on the rate outlook and said the recent relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary. “The market has gotten perhaps ahead of itself in quite confidently pricing in (U.S) interest rate cuts,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. “Powell was quite dismissive of the latest downturn in inflation... which I think has caused the market to reassess that a little bit.” Core European government bond yields also shuffled higher, tracking the rise in U.S. Treasuries after the Fed’s message. Asia trading had been thinned by holidays in Japan and China but Hong Kong and Korea’s stocks gained after CNBC reported the U.S. and China could announce a long-awaited trade deal by May 10, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He heads to Washington. Though now expected by markets if confirmed, it would remove significant uncertainty that has weighed on markets and global data for a year now. “I would still expect some relief rally once the deal gets done. The question is how big that move might be,” State Street GM’s Metcalfe added. Elsewhere Turkey’s lira remained under pressure near the 6 per dollar mark TRY+ after data there had showed manufacturing activity contracting for the 13th month in a row. Euro zone factory activity also contracted for a third straight month. “Demand shortages were again evident in the Turkish manufacturing sector in April, while currency weakness led to inflationary pressures building again,” said Andrew Harker, associate director of IHS Markit. In commodities markets, the drop in oil prices came after U.S. crude production output set a new record, though the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was last off 27 cents at $63.32 a barrel while Brent slipped 33 cents to $71.86. Copper was at a two month low after a heavy tumble on Wednesday, while spot gold was marginally weaker at $1,271.55 an ounce. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan

572,Sterling stands tall before BoE rates decision - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  8:21 AM / in 5 days","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - The British pound headed for a fourth consecutive day of gains on Thursday, buoyed by signs of a possible breakthrough in Brexit talks ahead of a central bank meeting. Sterling has traded in a narrow range of $1.28-$1.30 since Britain last month pushed its scheduled departure from the European Union back from March until Oct. 31. But the currency hit a two-week high on Tuesday and is nearing $1.31, helped by comments from Prime Minister Theresa May suggesting a rapprochement in talks with the Labour Party. The Bank of England looks set to leave interest rates on hold on Thursday and keep its options open for later in the year when it announces its first policy decision since the delay of Brexit. Almost no economists polled by Reuters expect the BoE to raise rates from 0.75 percent until Britain has left the EU. Some analysts believe a so-called “hawkish hold” by the central bank could lift sterling but only marginally with so little clarity about when, how, or even if, Brexit will happen. “While the BoE is likely to keep the door open for potential hikes we see the chances of a hike this year rather low as the economic growth is set to remain capped by the ongoing Brexit uncertainty,” said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING in London. “A mildly hawkish hold should lift GBP,” he added. The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.3080 and was flat against the euro at 85.76 pence. With Japan out for a week of holidays, traders are worried that the absence of Tokyo, one of the world’s top five currency trading centres, might fuel some exaggerated moves in foreign exchange markets. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows. Despite the pound’s gains against the dollar, net positions by hedge funds in sterling slipped back into negative territory, according to the latest data.

573,PRECIOUS-Gold falls to 1-week low as Fed ambiguity clouds rate-cut bets - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:16 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read* Federal Reserve keeps interest rates steady * Platinum touches lowest in nearly a month * Silver near 4-month low (Updates prices) By Arijit Bose May 2 (Reuters) - Gold on Thursday fell to its lowest in a little over one week, after comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a near-term rate cut, boosting the dollar and treasury yields. Spot gold shed 0.4 percent to $1,271.06 per ounce as of 0809 GMT, having fallen to $1,270.37, its lowest since April 24, earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures fell 0.9 percent to $1,272.60 an ounce. The Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday, but emphasized on the rhetoric that it does not see a readjustment of rates in the near term. “We know that the Fed is going to be on pause for a while, but the market was pricing in a more dovish lean towards the end of 2019,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading and market strategy, SPI Asset Management. Powell’s view on inflation revived an ailing dollar on Wednesday and also prompted U.S. Treasury yields higher. A higher interest rate increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold and pushes up the dollar and yields, leading to an inverse impact on the price of gold. “There is a little bit of ambiguity around (Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s) inflation language in particular. He sounded almost like Janet Yellen back in 2016 when he said that inflation risk could be transitory ... So that really means the Fed is probably going to be stuck in neutral,” Innes added. Meanwhile, Asian shares also adopted a wait-and-watch approach with major centres Japan and China shut for holidays. “Robust U.S. economic releases have eased global growth concerns as equity markets rally above 2018 highs. Strong risk appetites remain a bane for the precious metal,” Benjamin Lu, analyst, Phillip Futures, said in a note. Investors now closely monitor developments in the U.S.-China trade front with wide expectations that a deal to end a long-draw spat between the two countries could soon be realized, which may further boost risk appetite, thereby weighing on safe-haven gold. Politico reported that the two countries are nearing a trade deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Elsewhere, silver fell 0.3 percent to $14.63 an ounce, holding close to a more than four-month trough of $14.57 from Wednesday, while platinum prices fell 0.3 percent to $861.55, having touched $853, its lowest in nearly a month, earlier in the session. Palladium slipped 0.5 percent to $1,345.50, having touched its lowest level since Jan. 25 at $1,309.67 in the previous session.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.6 percent by 0730 GMT as major markets returned from the May Day holiday, except for London’s FTSE 100, which extended losses from the previous session. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed the doves after the central bank’s Wednesday meeting, signaling little appetite to adjust interest rates anytime soon. Later on Thursday, the Bank of England will also decide on rates. No change is likely; investors will be looking for a better picture of the UK economy and clues on Brexit preparations. The basic resources sector dropped 1.3 percent after copper prices fell to their lowest in more than two months. The bank sub-index fell after a mixed bag of earnings. The Dutch bank ING Groep NV tumbled after reporting a 6.1 pct decline in first-quarter profits, but France’s BNP Paribas  rose 1 percent after its first-quarter net profits beat expectations. Britain’s Lloyds Banking Group posted robust first quarter profits although house prices cooled and confidence dwindled among its small-business borrowers. The stock fell. Among the bright spots, Sanofi SA’s shares got a lift after the drugmaker won U.S. regulatory approval for its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. Europe’s biggest online-only fashion retailer, Zalando, were boosted by solid first-quarter sales growth. German fashion house Hugo Boss slipped after reporting a fall in first-quarter earnings.

575,U.S. Democrat O'Rourke raised $9.4 million in first weeks of campaign - Reuters,"April 3, 2019 /  6:14 PM / a month ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke raised $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his bid for the presidency, his campaign announced on Wednesday.  O’Rourke, the former congressman from Texas whose unsuccessful Senate run in 2018 garnered him national attention, collected 218,000 separate contributions, his campaign said in a statement.  The average donation was $43, his campaign said. Like most of his Democratic rivals, O’Rourke is refusing campaign donations from corporate political action groups or lobbyists. Of the money he did raise, 99 percent came from online solicitations, O’Rourke’s campaign said. Candidates are required by law to track and report all campaign donations. Donations collected between Jan. 1 and March 31 must be disclosed by April 15. Candidates are limited to collecting $2,800 from a single donor during the primary process.          O’Rourke’s first-quarter haul lags behind some of his other Democratic rivals who announced their candidacies earlier in the year and therefore had more time to raise funds. O’Rourke launched his campaign on March 14.  U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who launched her campaign in late January, raised $12 million in the first quarter. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who began his campaign in late February, raised $18.2 million. With such a crowded field - more than 15 Democrats have announced they are running - fundraising abilities have become an early way to prove to donors and potential supporters that a candidate is viable.  Additionally, the Democratic National Committee has said a candidate must have raised money from 65,000 different donors in order to qualify for the first debate to be held on June 26 and 27.

576,U.S. states sue to undo Trump rollback of healthy school lunch rules - Reuters,"April 3, 2019 /  4:25 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Several U.S. states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday to undo its recent decision that allowed fewer whole grains and more sodium in school breakfasts and lunches. The states accused the U.S. Department of Agriculture of ignoring federal dietary guidelines and scientific research on children’s nutrition when it eased rules championed by former first lady Michelle Obama to make school meals healthier. New York, California, Illinois, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont and the District of Columbia said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner, and asked a Manhattan federal judge to void the new sodium and whole grain standards. “The Trump administration has undermined key health benefits for our children . . . with deliberate disregard for science, expert opinion, and the law,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. Spokespeople for the Department of Agriculture did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The changes announced last Dec. 6 affect the federally funded National School Lunch Program, which was started by President Harry Truman in 1946 and feeds more than 30 million, mostly lower-income children. They are among a series of White House-supported efforts to roll back federal regulatory oversight that President Donald Trump considers burdensome to business and economic growth. The changes included cutting in half the amount of whole grains required to be served starting in the 2019-20 school year, affording schools more flexibility to offer noodles, tortillas and other foods containing mainly refined grains. They also included a five-year delay in the maximum sodium target scheduled for the next school year, and elimination of a sodium target set for the 2022-23 school year. Perdue has said his agency was committed to nutritious meals in schools, but the changes acknowledged the “challenges” that schools face serving appetizing yet healthy meals, while ensuring that food would not be wasted.  Other changes included allowing schools to serve low-fat chocolate milk, rather than fat-free milk. The new rules set aside requirements under the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which Michelle Obama had supported in her fight against child obesity. It had set new limits for calories, sodium and trans fats, while requiring more fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Excessive sodium intake has been linked to heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke, while relatively higher refined grain consumption has been linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and obesity.

Two other Democratic contenders, Andrew Yang and Julian Castro, also told the conference organized by prominent civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton that they would sign a bill in Congress to create a commission to study reparations. The three Democrats, the first of a dozen 2020 presidential candidates who will speak to the conference over the next three days, also backed criminal justice reforms including the legalization of marijuana and clearing the records of non-violent drug offenders. Other Democratic contenders have embraced a bill sponsored by U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee to create a reparations commission, although O’Rourke had not taken a stance until Sharpton asked him about it. O’Rourke, a former Texas congressman, pledged his support with a reference to the civil rights advances of recent decades. “Until all Americans understand that civil rights are not just those victories but the injustices that have been visited and continue to be visited on people, we will never get the change we need to live up to the promise of this country,” he said. Reparations has become a prominent issue in the Democratic race for the nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, and Sharpton praised Castro for helping to bring it to the forefront. “Our country will never truly heal until we address the original sin of slavery,” Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and U.S. housing secretary, told the conference. The historically diverse 2020 Democratic field, including black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates as well as a record six women, is tackling an array of issues of interest in the African-American community following the first decline in their turnout in 20 years in 2016. That was a key contributor to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s stunning loss to Trump. After a question from Sharpton, O’Rourke said police violence was the byproduct of a “larger system - not just of criminal justice in this country. But a system that has successfully suppressed some Americans based on their race for as long as we have been a country.” The conference in New York is giving activists from around the country a chance to judge the candidates in person. The sessions will continue on Thursday and Friday. Sharpton said not everyone would agree with the candidates on everything, but support for voting rights, healthcare access and criminal justice reform were “not negotiable for us in the civil rights movement.” Democrats are grappling with ways to address Trump’s sometimes polarizing racial comments and what polls have found are rising racial tensions since Trump became president. The candidate who can win African-American support stands to reap significant rewards, as black voters play a big role in Democratic primaries. In South Carolina, which holds an early primary in February 2020, more than 60 percent of the Democratic primary voters were black in 2016. Sharpton has met with several candidates, but plans to hold off on an endorsement until later in the year.

578,Blackstone sues RCS owner directly over disputed HQ sale - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  7:56 AM / 5 days ago","2 Min ReadMILAN, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group has launched legal action against the chairman and controlling shareholder of Italian publisher RCS Mediagroup over a disputed property sale, a copy of the lawsuit showed. Filed in New York on April 22 and suing RCS Chairman Urbano Cairo directly, the latest action adds to the one Blackstone filed against RCS last November. The first lawsuit was put on hold on April 24 pending the outcome of arbitration in Italy. The case centres on RCS’ historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($134 million) in 2013. Cairo, who became RCS’ controlling shareholder in 2016, has said Blackstone bought the properties at too low a price when RCS faced financial difficulties, and the transaction should be declared void. The publisher, owner of influential daily Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings under Italian law in November to annul the sale. Blackstone has in turn accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property and that the publisher improperly blocked it from selling to Germany’s Allianz last summer, according to the two U.S. filings. The private equity firm says in the latest complaint that it suffered damages as a result of Cairo’s alleged “intentional interference with (Blackstone’s) prospective business relations in an amount to be proven at trial”. Cairo was not immediately available for a comment. ($1 = 0.8935 euros) (Reporting by Claudia Cristoferi Editing by Keith Weir )All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

579,BNP Paribas profits boosted by investment bank rebound - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:22 AM / in 5 days","3 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - BNP Paribas on Thursday reported higher first-quarter net profits, supported by a recovery at its corporate and investment banking division which benefited from a more favorable market environment. Weak financial markets had hit this business in the fourth quarter of 2018 when revenues fell sharply to 650 million euros, but in the first quarter they jumped to 1.52 billion. Revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies were up 32 percent from the first quarter 2018, a stronger performance than at some other big investment banks, such as Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. “Corporate and institutional banking marked an upturn in client activity despite a still unfavorable market context at the beginning of the quarter,” Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said in a video on BNP Paribas’ website. The bank said clients had returned in the last month of the quarter. “The division was well prepared for this upturn,” Bonnafe said. In February, BNP Paribas announced plans to cut 350 million euros in costs from the corporate and investment bank after the weak fourth quarter. “A good set of results driven by a good dynamic on the top line, good cost management delivering positive jaws in most divisions,” analysts at Jefferies said, keeping a “buy” rating on the shares. BNP Paribas’ shares were up by around 1 percent in early session trading.  Major European banks like BNP Paribas have struggled to drive profitability because low interest rates have constrained returns from retail banking, while corporate and investment banking is vulnerable to financial market volatility. The bank’s net profit rose 22 percent from the same period in 2018 to 1.92 billion euros ($2.15 billion). Analysts polled by Infront Data for Reuters expected a net profit of 1.71 billion euros. Overall revenues rose 3.2 percent to 11.14 billion euros, above analysts’ forecasts for revenues of 10.65 billion. BNP Paribas also booked an 838 million euro capital gain on the sale of a stake in Indian insurer SBI Life.  The French bank said it expected its cost-cutting plan to have a positive impact on its bottom line in coming quarters, as savings would outpace other costs.  In the remaining quarters of this year, savings will outpace costs and in 2020 BNP Paribas said it expected to book 3.3 billion worth of savings and no costs linked to transforming its business.

580,Fed pause pushes euro zone bond yields higher - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  7:26 AM / in 5 days","3 Min Read* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr By Virginia Furness LONDON, May 2 (Reuters) - Core euro zone bond yields opened higher after a pause in trading for the May Day holiday, tracking the rise in U.S. Treasuries after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and signalled little appetite to adjust them any time soon. Fed Chair Jerome Powell shook off pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to cut interest rates by one percent and was unwavering the policy rate outlook, saying the recent relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary. Powell acknowledged a modest pick-up in growth in Q1, which marked a shift from previous statements, but analysts noted the reference was past tense, and took the comments to mean the Fed did not expect growth to necessarily continue. “There’s concern among the Fed that the positive impact of the tax cuts is beginning to wane, and growth may indeed prove softer going forward,” said Matt Cairns, rates strategist at Rabobank. “The language is neither prompting an acceleration in terms of monetary policy, or a deceleration.” The policy statement, and particularly Powell’s insistence the Fed saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut in response to weak inflation, prompted a modest selloff in stock markets and pushed bond yields higher. Indeed data on Wednesday supported the view that signs of growth in Q1 will not be sustained. Weakness in global manufacturing is driving dovish monetary policy on both sides of the pond and the euro zone print later this session will be closely watched. U.S. manufacturing activity — released on Wednesday —slowed to a 2-1/2-year low in April amid a sharp drop in new orders while construction spending unexpectedly fell in March, suggesting economic growth was moderating after surging in the first quarter. One of the reports from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed businesses increasingly anxious that President Donald Trump’s threats to close the U.S.-Mexico boarder would further disrupt the supply chain. Washington’s trade war with China has created bottlenecks at factories. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields fell below 2.48 percent after the factory data disappointed and fuelled fears of a slowdown. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the region opened two basis points higher at 0.029 percent, matching the move higher in most other core 10-year bond yields in the bloc.,, German retail sales fell by 0.2 percent on the month in March, due largely to sharp drops in sales of food, drink and tobacco, data showed on Thursday. In the UK, the Bank of England is expected to keep rates no hold with the focus of the market on the outcome of today’s local elections.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on his Twitter account that the two countries have completed “productive” talks in Beijing. Base metals slumped on the London Metal Exchange (LME) on Wednesday, with aluminium and lead hitting their lowest in more than two years, as computer-driven funds sold after an options expiry amid concerns about China demand. “One of the issues has been the absence of real hard tangible information or data coming out from China that shows a proper pick-up,” said Guy Wolf of broker Marex Spectron. “What is clear for everyone is the major slowdown at the backend of last year is stabilised.

584,RPT-Thomas Cook sets May 7 deadline for interest in airline business -sources - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:56 AM / in 5 days","3 Min Read(Repeats MAY 1 story, no change to text) By Kate Holton and Clara Denina LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Thomas Cook has set a deadline of May 7 for expressions of interest in its airline business, with Indigo Partners and Lufthansa among the likely bidders, sources said. The heavily-indebted British travel group put its profitable airline business up for sale in February after profit warnings in 2018 left it needing to raise cash. Thomas Cook’s airlines business consists of Germany’s Condor, as well as British, Scandinavian and Spanish operations. A sale of the business, in whole or in part, would enable the world’s oldest tour operator to invest more in its own hotels and improve its online sales. A source familiar with the discussions said that Indigo and Germany’s Lufthansa appeared most interested in the business. British Airways owner IAG should not be ruled out and easyJet has engaged in talks but is seen as less interested, the source added. It is not clear whether Ireland’s Ryanair would bid. Another source said that private equity groups KKR and Apollo might also look at taking over the whole of Thomas Cook. The airlines business would provide access to valuable European slots linking Britain to Spain, Greece and Turkey. Thomas Cook, Indigo, IAG and easyJet declined to comment, while Lufthansa and Ryanair were not immediately available. Lufthansa executives have said repeatedly that the German airline wants to “play an active role” in consolidation. Indigo, the private equity firm managed by Bill Franke, the veteran U.S. low-cost airline investor, has previously made investments in several airlines including Hungary’s Wizz. Thomas Cook has been revamping different parts of its business this year, closing high street stores and reviewing its money division as it focuses on holidays. The company was hit badly in 2018 when a hot European summer deterred customers from booking holidays through the year. One banking source said the airline would fetch less than 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion). Thomas Cook has a current market value of just over 400 million pounds ($522.68 million). Sources said that competition issues could influence which parts of the business different suitors go for. Sky News has said China’s Fosun International, a Thomas Cook shareholder, was interested in its tour business.

587,RPT-GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares flatline after Fed's neutral message - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:46 AM / 5 days ago","5 Min Read(Repeats to add headline tag with no changes to text) * Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Japan and China markets shut for public holidays * MSCI ex-Japan down 0.1 pct, Australian shares off 0.7 pct * Dollar gains overnight as Fed stays neutral By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Asian markets marked time on Thursday with two major centres - Japan and China - shut for holidays while the dollar held on to overnight gains after the U.S. central bank poured cold water on rate cut expectations. Australian shares slipped 0.7 percent while New Zealand was up 1.2 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI index added 0.4 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were unchanged. In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.23 percent at 3,444, German DAX futures were 0.18 percent lower at 12,329, while FTSE futures were down 0.36 percent at 7,305.5. Trading in Japan will resume next Tuesday while China will be back in action on Monday. Global equities markets have scaled new highs since the start of the year largely on expectations of easy monetary policies around the world while a positive tone on U.S.-China trade negotiations has also aided sentiment. But analysts are now wondering whether this strong run can continue. “Coming into May, the search for the next catalyst becomes an obvious necessary condition to give an answer to the traditional question: is it time to sell and go away?” said Claudio Irigoyen, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Irigoyen was referring to a well-known adage, “sell in May and go away”, which warns investors to dump their equities’ holdings in May ahead of the northern hemisphere summer trading lull and switch to fixed income in a bid to maximise returns. “We remain constructive that the recovery in China will translate into a recovery in the emerging market-export complex and Europe; the worst-case scenario will be avoided regarding Brexit and that the recent progress will materialise in a U.S.-China deal in 2Q,” Irigoyen added. “It follows that the overall environment is therefore still favourable for EM, not so much due to cheap valuations but still attractive enough risk-adjusted carry.” Investors are keeping a close eye on first-quarter earnings for clues on the health of the U.S. corporate sector. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data - a starkly better outcome than the start of April when earnings were expected to decline by 2 percent. In currency markets, the greenback took a breather following strong gains overnight after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the target range for its policy rate unchanged at its May meeting. Markets had anticipated the Fed would signal a “precautionary cut” to stoke inflation but “the statement gave almost nothing away in this respect,” Anna Stupnytska, global economist for Fidelity International said in an emailed statement. The dollar index held at 97.62 against a basket of major currencies after going as high as 97.728 on Wednesday. It stood at 111.61 yen after consistently easing from a four-month high of 112.39 touched last week. The Fed’s mixed messages on policy have been a drag on the dollar. It downgraded its inflation outlook and made a technical cut to rates on excess reserves. Yet, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the factors dragging on inflation might be “transitory” and he saw no case for a rate move in either direction. “When pressed on the potential for a rate cut, he simply emphasised that the Committee is satisfied with the current policy stance and did not give away much more for markets to cling onto,” Stupnytska added Dollar hawks also received a boost from early data on the labour market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate. Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. In commodities, oil prices declined after data showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week but the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was last off 27 cents at $63.32 a barrel while Brent slipped 33 cents to $71.86. Spot gold was marginally weaker at $1,271.55 an ounce. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan

588,Truckers gridlocked at U.S.-Mexico line as border agents moved - Reuters,"April 2, 2019 /  9:38 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadCIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Trucks delivering goods from Mexico to the United States are facing up to 12 hours of gridlock, drivers said, after a transfer of U.S. border agents to immigration duties slowed the flow of commercial traffic at several border crossings. President Donald Trump took a step back on Tuesday from his threat to close the U.S. southern border to fight illegal immigration, amid pressure from companies worried that a shutdown would inflict chaos on supply chains and the $1.7 billion daily trade. But the reshuffling of border agents, announced last week to process the record number of migrant families entering the United States from Mexico, prompted delays of up to 12 hours for trucks crossing from Mexico’s Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, truckers told Reuters. “Industry is most affected by this situation, due to the millions in fines they have to pay when deliveries arrive late to clients,” said Manuel Sotelo, head of the truckers union in Ciudad Juarez. He said the delays could even lead to the cancellation of contracts and layoffs. Senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said on Tuesday the recent redeployment of some 750 officers on the border to deal with a surge in migrants - mostly Central American families turning themselves in to border agents - led to the slowing of legal crossings and commerce at ports of entry. “The U.S. threat is being carried out and having an impact on factories, transportation companies and most directly on drivers,” truck driver Jose Cota said. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement that, as of Monday, the Otay Mesa commercial facility, one of the ports of entry at the San Diego-Tijuana crossing, would operate eight out of the 10 truck lanes for the inspection and processing of imports and conveyances from Mexico. “The indefinite reduction of processing lanes at the Otay Mesa commercial facility is due to this deployment (of agents). As such, we will be unable to extend the hours of operation impacting our ability to provide services after our regular closing times,” it said. Mexico’s customs agency said the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo crossing from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas into Texas was also affected and asked truck drivers to reschedule their deliveries considering that the port of entry would now close at 11:00 p.m. daily. Trump said on Friday he would close the border this week unless Mexico acted to curb a surge of asylum seekers from countries in Central America. He backed off that on Tuesday, saying that Mexico had made progress in detaining migrant flows. Long lines of trucks started forming at the border crossings from Friday, as the number of agents was cut, said Cota, who had been waiting since 6 a.m. to cross into El Paso. “There is no danger ... this is just the United States government’s way of pressuring and blackmailing,” Cota said. Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, also noted that commercial traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border had slowed at several crossings due to the transfer of U.S. border agents. “They don’t intend on shutting (the border) but they have this problem that they are reallocating personnel,” Ebrard said. He said Mexico would be prepared for the possibility of a border shutdown if it were to happen.

589,Democrats mock Trump over healthcare delay ahead of 2020 election battle - Reuters,"April 2, 2019 /  3:20 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats mocked President Donald Trump on Tuesday for pushing back his promise of sweeping healthcare reform until after the 2020 election, and said they were happy to make it a central campaign issue. Trump had pledged in recent days to use court action to end Obamacare, the signature law of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, and said his Republican Party would push over the next few months for a better healthcare plan at lower cost for most Americans. But Republican leaders in Congress quickly shied away from the issue and pushed him to reconsider. In a series of late-night tweets on Monday, Trump did just that, saying there would be no vote on any healthcare legislation until after next year’s election. Democrats gleefully jumped on the delay, saying it showed Trump and his party had no idea what to do with healthcare beyond repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. “Last night the president tweeted that they will come up with their plan in 2021. Translation: they have no healthcare plan,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. “They are for repeal, they have no replace.” Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said he told Trump on Monday the party was not about to restart work on comprehensive healthcare legislation, noting Republicans were unable to pass a plan when they controlled both chambers of Congress in the first two years of the Trump presidency. “I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,” McConnell told reporters.  Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in November elections after campaigning heavily on strengthening Obamacare. Trump said on Tuesday he and Republicans would draw up a new healthcare plan ahead of the 2020 election and implement it soon afterward. “I think we’re going to have a great healthcare package ... If we get back the House and on the assumption we keep the Senate and we keep the presidency – which I hope are two good assumptions – we’re going to have a phenomenal healthcare,” Trump told reporters. He said a Republican plan would mean most Americans pay lower premiums and deductibles for their healthcare than they currently pay under Obamacare, revisiting a promise he made during the 2016 campaign. Trump told House Republicans in a speech on Tuesday night that they should campaign on a pledge to make healthcare the first vote in Congress after the 2020 election. He said one of the major reasons Democrats won control of the House last year was because Republicans did not have a healthcare plan to put forward to voters. “Republicans should not run away from healthcare. You can’t do it. You’re going to get clobbered,” Trump said. While Trump’s delay gives Republicans more time to knit together an alternative to Obamacare, it all but guarantees a 2020 battle over the divisive issue. “Don’t let President Trump fool you, America. Republicans are not the party of healthcare. They are the party that wants to end your healthcare,” Schumer said at a rally on Tuesday. “We Democrats will not stop fighting tooth and nail to protect America’s healthcare, today, tomorrow, and on in through 2021.” Trump and his fellow Republicans vowed in the 2016 presidential election to “repeal and replace” Obamacare but failed to do so during their first two years in power, despite control of both the Senate and the House.   Several of the leading candidates for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination, including a number of current U.S. senators, have already made healthcare a major part of their campaign message. Trump accuses Democrats of seeking “a socialist takeover of American healthcare,” and is certain to take that argument onto the 2020 campaign trail.   “I see what the Democrats are doing. It’s a disaster what they’re planning and everyone knows it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday.

590,North Carolina Republican Party chairman charged in bribery case - Reuters,"April 2, 2019 /  4:41 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it had charged the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, Robert “Robin” Hayes, and a major political donor in a corruption scheme that targeted a state official. According to an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, Hayes worked with business executive Greg Lindberg to bribe state insurance commissioner Mike Causey. Causey reported the effort to law enforcement officials and cooperated in the investigation, authorities say. The two men, along with insurance executives John Gray, 68, and John Palermo, 63, were charged with bribery and conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud. Hayes is also charged with lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. All four men pleaded not guilty.  Lawyers for Hayes and Lindberg said their clients looked forward to clearing their names in court. Lawyers for Gray and Palermo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to the indictment, the four men promised to spend millions of dollars on Causey’s re-election if he would  remove an insurance regulator that oversaw companies under Lindberg’s control.  They said they would set up independent campaign committees that would spend $1.5 million on Causey’s re-election bid and funnel another $250,000 through the state Republican party. Hayes encouraged the others to transfer the money in smaller amounts to avoid detection, the indictment said. “My concern, any large amount like that’s gonna draw attention,” he said, according to the charges. Lindberg is the founder and chairman of investment company Eli Global and the owner of Global Bankers Insurance Group, which controls several insurance companies. Neither company was charged, and Global Bankers said it was cooperating with the investigation. Lindberg is the state’s biggest political donor in recent years,  with total contributions of more than $5 million, mostly to Republicans, according to news site WRAL.  Hayes served in the U.S. Congress from 1999 to 2009. He led the state party between 2011 and 2013, when it won a dominant majority in the state legislature, and again since 2016. He announced yesterday that he would step down from the position. Lindberg and Gray also enlisted another public official, who made several calls to Causey on their behalf after they contributed $150,000 to a political committee supporting his candidacy, according to the indictment.  That official, identified by Politico as U.S. Republican Representative Mark Walker, was not charged. A spokesman for Walker said he had committed no wrongdoing and had assisted the investigation. The North Carolina Republican Party said it has been cooperating with the probe for several months. The party has suffered a series of setbacks after several years in which it controlled the state government, pushing through spending cuts, voting restrictions, and other conservative policies. An absentee ballot fraud scheme run by a party operative has forced the rerun of a 2018 U.S. congressional election, and a federal court ruled last year that state Republicans illegally drew U.S. congressional districts to benefit their party. Democrat Roy Cooper was elected as governor in 2016, breaking the Republican grip on state politics, and Democrats made significant gains in state assembly elections last year.

591,Asian shares flatline after Fed's neutral message - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:41 AM / in 5 days","5 Min Read* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Japan and China markets shut for public holidays * MSCI ex-Japan down 0.1 pct, Australian shares off 0.7 pct * Dollar gains overnight as Fed stays neutral (Updates prices) By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Asian markets marked time on Thursday with two major centres - Japan and China - shut for holidays while the dollar held on to overnight gains after the U.S. central bank poured cold water on rate cut expectations. Australian shares slipped 0.7 percent while New Zealand was up 1.2 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI index added 0.4 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were unchanged. In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures were down 0.23 percent at 3,444, German DAX futures were 0.18 percent lower at 12,329, while FTSE futures were down 0.36 percent at 7,305.5. Trading in Japan will resume next Tuesday while China will be back in action on Monday. Global equities markets have scaled new highs since the start of the year largely on expectations of easy monetary policies around the world while a positive tone on U.S.-China trade negotiations has also aided sentiment. But analysts are now wondering whether this strong run can continue. “Coming into May, the search for the next catalyst becomes an obvious necessary condition to give an answer to the traditional question: is it time to sell and go away?” said Claudio Irigoyen, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Irigoyen was referring to a well-known adage, “sell in May and go away”, which warns investors to dump their equities’ holdings in May ahead of the northern hemisphere summer trading lull and switch to fixed income in a bid to maximise returns. “We remain constructive that the recovery in China will translate into a recovery in the emerging market-export complex and Europe; the worst-case scenario will be avoided regarding Brexit and that the recent progress will materialise in a U.S.-China deal in 2Q,” Irigoyen added. “It follows that the overall environment is therefore still favourable for EM, not so much due to cheap valuations but still attractive enough risk-adjusted carry.” Investors are keeping a close eye on first-quarter earnings for clues on the health of the U.S. corporate sector. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data - a starkly better outcome than the start of April when earnings were expected to decline by 2 percent. In currency markets, the greenback took a breather following strong gains overnight after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the target range for its policy rate unchanged at its May meeting. Markets had anticipated the Fed would signal a “precautionary cut” to stoke inflation but “the statement gave almost nothing away in this respect,” Anna Stupnytska, global economist for Fidelity International said in an emailed statement. The dollar index held at 97.62 against a basket of major currencies after going as high as 97.728 on Wednesday. It stood at 111.61 yen after consistently easing from a four-month high of 112.39 touched last week. The Fed’s mixed messages on policy have been a drag on the dollar. It downgraded its inflation outlook and made a technical cut to rates on excess reserves. Yet, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the factors dragging on inflation might be “transitory” and he saw no case for a rate move in either direction. “When pressed on the potential for a rate cut, he simply emphasised that the Committee is satisfied with the current policy stance and did not give away much more for markets to cling onto,” Stupnytska added Dollar hawks also received a boost from early data on the labour market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate. Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. In commodities, oil prices declined after data showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week but the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was last off 27 cents at $63.32 a barrel while Brent slipped 33 cents to $71.86. Spot gold was marginally weaker at $1,271.55 an ounce. Additional reporting by Vidya Ranganathan

A Reuters poll had pointed to a month-on-month fall of 0.4 percent. Sales slipped by 2.1 percent on the year as consumers delayed pre-Easter shopping until April because of the timing of the holiday, Germany’s Federal Statistics Office said. Household spending has become a key growth driver in recent years as Germans benefit from record-high employment and low borrowing costs, but retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.

593,CORRECTED-FOREX-Dollar left to drift as Fed steers steady course - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:28 AM / in 5 days","3 Min Read(Corrects ninth paragraph to show implied rate for December is 2.25 percent) * Dollar steadies after choppy NY session overnight * Fed’s Powell plays down low inflation, says no need to cut * No major data in Asia holiday trade, payrolls next hurdle By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - The dollar was content to consolidate in Asia on Thursday after recovering from a brief spill overnight when markets were whipsawed by mixed messages on policy from the Federal Reserve. Trading ranges were again tight with both Japan and China on holiday and little in the way of major economic data in the diary. The break was welcome after a volatile session overnight. The dollar had taken an initial knock from a surprisingly sharp retreat in the ISM index of manufacturing to 52.8, which overshadowed a strong ADP report on hiring. It fell further when the Fed downgraded its inflation outlook and made a technical cut to rates on excess reserves. All that changed when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the factors dragging on inflation might be “transitory” and he saw no case for a rate move in either direction. The net result was a rebound in a dollar index against a basket of currencies, leaving it last at 97.606 compared to a low of 97.149 on Wednesday. The euro was back at $1.1207, after reaching as high as $1.1265 overnight, while the dollar steadied at 111.54 yen from a low of 111.03. Bonds likewise see-sawed with the two-year yield first diving to a one-month trough of 2.206 percent, only to end the Wednesday session 4 basis points higher at 2.31 percent. As the dust settled, the market had scaled back a little of its wagers for Fed rate cuts this year with 2.25 percent implied for December. “Our view remains that the Fed has completed its policy normalisation process and we should expect an extended period of rates on hold,” said Joseph Capurso, senior currency strategist at CBA. “But the risk to our forecasts have changed.” “If the FOMC is to change the Funds rate over the next few years, it is likely to be a cut,” he said, citing slowing inflation, record-low inflation expectations and flat wages. The next major test for the dollar will be U.S. payrolls on Friday where any surprise has the power to shift Fed rate expectations all over again. Sterling was one of the few currencies to buck the dollar, touching a two-week high on Wednesday on speculation Brexit talks between the British government and the main opposition party were making some progress. The pound was last at $1.3054 in Asia, having been as high as $1.3101 overnight. There was scant immediate reaction to a report the United States and China were nearing a trade deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Investors have become accustomed to endless reports of progress and want to see an actual deal signed before celebrating.

594,GLOBAL ECONOMY-Asia manufacturing bottoming out but economies may still need more stimulus - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:46 AM / in 5 days","6 Min Read* Asia PMI data mixed, central banks seen leaning dovish * Global demand still sluggish, trade uncertainties remain * China stimulus yet to fully kick in, more may be on the cards (Updates with India PMI, adds graphic) By Marius Zaharia HONG KONG, May 2 (Reuters) - Factory activity recovered last month in parts of Asia but still appeared to be on shaky ground as global demand remained subdued and China’s stimulus measures were yet to show their full pulling power. That left the outlook for the region’s central banks skewed towards easing, with Malaysia and New Zealand prime suspects for potential rate cuts, and Australia — whose monetary policy setters also meet next week — facing growing calls to ease. Business surveys showed factories were struggling around the world, with euro zone data later on Thursday expected to show a contraction in the manufacturing sector, and the United States still growing, but missing expectations by a wide margin on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady overnight, saying it saw no strong case for either hiking or cutting them, disappointing U.S. stock markets. A resolution in the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing would go a long way towards improving the mood. While there is still great uncertainty, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries completed “productive” talks on Wednesday and were nearing a deal that would roll back a portion of the $250 billion in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Purchasing Managers’ Indexes showed manufacturing activity contracted in Malaysia and Taiwan in April, slowed in the Philippines and Indonesia, and picked up a notch in Vietnam and Thailand. India’s factory activity expanded at its slowest pace in eight months, with growth in new orders and output dipping as national elections got under way. Earlier this week, official data showed activity in China expanded for a second consecutive month in April, but at a much slower pace than expected. As China has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years, financial markets have been counting on another strong, credit-fuelled bounce. “We’re starting to see a bottoming out of the slowdown that started in the latter part of last year,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ. “But bottoming out doesn’t mean that economies are firing away .. We still think in some economies further support will be very helpful,” said Goh, who expects rate cuts in Malaysia, Philippines and Indonesia. South Korean manufacturing snapped a five-month streak of contractions, but remained weak with new export orders shrinking for a ninth straight month and subcomponents of the index pointing to sluggish demand both at home and abroad. South Korea’s economy contracted in the first quarter and chances are it may struggle to return to growth in the second. Data on Wednesday showed exports still shrinking, with memory chip shipments down 13.5 percent. “Export-driven economies are inevitably being hit hardest but sector-specific stories continue to explain country divergences: vehicles and semi-conductors remain among the weakest,” said Janet Henry, global chief economist at HSBC. After a projected 5.3 percent growth rate in 2018, east Asian economies are expected to expand at a slower pace of 5.1 percent in 2019 and 5.0 percent in 2020, the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) said in a report. The region includes China, South Korea, Japan and the 10 countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations. Japan releases PMI data next week due to public holidays. In China, both official and private factory surveys suggested an unexpected loss of momentum last month, though overall activity still expanded, albeit at a more subdued rate. While most analysts believe the worst may be over for the world’s second-largest economy, the disappointing readings — which followed surprisingly upbeat March data — suggested it is still struggling for traction. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 50.2 in April from March’s eight-month high of 50.8, countering economists’ expectations for a rise to 51.0. The official PMI survey fell to 50.1 from 50.5, also missing forecasts. Economists had predicted steady to slightly stronger growth, indicating that stimulus measures may be kicking in more slowly than expected. Beijing in March announced additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending this year worth hundreds of billions of dollars, while bank lending in the first quarter hit a record 5.81 trillion yuan ($862.8 billion). The People’s Bank of China has also been cutting banks’ reserve requirements and keeping short-term money market rates low. The pick-up in manufacturing activity in March, and steady GDP growth in the first quarter, has prompted the central bank to shift into a wait-and-see stance, with stronger easing measures seen on hold while policymakers await more data. April’s downbeat factory readings, however, coupled with a soft outlook for trade, have raised questions over how much more stimulus is needed to generate sustainable growth in China with risking a sharper jump in debt. “These uncertainties make us strongly believe that the Chinese government will continue its fiscal stimulus to support industrial sectors through infrastructure stimulus, and will provide enough credit to smaller private firms to keep them running and stabilise the job market,” said ING’s Greater China economist Iris Pang.

600,GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares trade sideways as investors await fresh cues - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  1:15 AM / 5 days ago","5 Min Read* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Japan and China closed for public holidays * MSCI ex-Japan down 0.1 pct, Australian shares off 0.7 pct * Dollar gained overnight as Fed stayed neutral By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, May 2 (Reuters) - Asian markets marked time on Thursday with two major centres - Japan and China - shut for holidays while the dollar held on to overnight gains after the U.S. central bank poured cold water on rate cut expectations. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.1 percent, trading in a tight band. Australian shares slipped 0.7 percent while New Zealand was up 0.4 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI index added 0.1 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were unchanged. Trading in Japan will resume next Tuesday while China will be back in action on Monday. Global equities markets have scaled new highs since the start of the year largely on expectations of easy monetary policies around the world while a positive tone on U.S.-China trade negotiations has also aided sentiment. But analysts are now wondering whether this strong run can continue. “Coming into May, the search for the next catalyst becomes an obvious necessary condition to give an answer to the traditional question: is it time to sell and go away?” said Claudio Irigoyen, economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Irigoyen was referring to a well-known adage, “sell in May and go away”, which warns investors to dump their equities holdings in May ahead of the northern hemisphere summer trading lull and switch to fixed income in a bid to maximise returns. “We remain constructive that the recovery in China will translate into a recovery in the emerging market-export complex and Europe; the worst-case scenario will be avoided regarding Brexit and that the recent progress will materialise in a U.S.-China deal in 2Q,” Irigoyen added. “It follows that the overall environment is therefore still favorable for EM, not so much due to cheap valuations but still attractive enough risk-adjusted carry.” Investors are keeping a close eye on first-quarter earnings for clues on the health of the U.S. corporate sector. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5 percent for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data - a starkly better outcome than the start of April when earnings were expected to decline by 2 percent. In currency markets, the greenback took a breather following strong gains overnight after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept the target range for its policy rate unchanged at its May meeting. Markets had anticipated the Fed would signal a “precautionary cut” to stoke inflation but “the statement gave almost nothing away in this respect,” Anna Stupnytska, global economist for Fidelity International said in an emailed statement. The dollar index held at 97.631 against a basket of major currencies after going as high as 97.728 on Wednesday. It stood at 111.49 yen after consistently easing from a four-month high of 112.39 touched last week. “In the press conference, Chairman Powell chose to strike a somewhat more hawkish tone, attributing the unexpected fall in core inflation this year to transitory factors and not signalling much concern about the underlying inflation picture at the moment,” Stupnytska added. “When pressed on the potential for a rate cut, he simply emphasised that the Committee is satisfied with the current policy stance and did not give away much more for markets to cling onto.” Dollar hawks also received a boost from early data on the labour market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate. Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. In commodities, oil prices declined after data showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week but the losses were capped by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude was last off 3 cents at $63.57 a barrel while Brent slipped 9 cents to $72.09. Spot gold was unchanged at $1,277.07 an ounce.

603,Second woman says ex-VP Biden touched her inappropriately - Reuters,"April 1, 2019 /  10:14 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Connecticut woman said Joe Biden touched her inappropriately and rubbed noses with her at a 2009 political fundraiser, becoming the second person in three days to accuse the former vice president of unwanted physical contact as he considers a White House run. “It wasn’t sexual, but he did grab me by the head,” Amy Lappos, 43, told the Hartford Courant on Monday of her encounter with Biden at a Greenwich, Connecticut, event. “He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in, I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.” Lappos posted about the alleged incident in a Connecticut Women in Politics Facebook group on Sunday in response to an account by former Nevada state legislator Lucy Flores, who last week accused Biden of kissing her on the back of the head at a 2014 event. The allegations could endanger a possible 2020 presidential run by Biden, who was vice president under President Barack Obama at the time of both alleged instances. He has been expected to announce a Democratic White House bid in the coming weeks and has been leading the Democratic presidential field in opinion polls. Asked about the Connecticut allegation, a Biden spokesman pointed to Biden’s statement on Sunday, when he said he did not believe he ever acted inappropriately during his many years in public life and on the campaign trail. “I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” Biden said in the statement. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.” Biden has long been known for a warm and intimate campaign style, but his propensity for hugging and physical touching has come under new scrutiny in the #MeToo era as awareness about sexual assault and harassment has grown. Lappos, a former aide to U.S. Representative Jim Himes, told the Courant she felt uncomfortable when Biden approached her at a fundraiser for Himes. She said she was in the kitchen with three or four other volunteers when Biden moved toward her. “I never filed a complaint, to be honest, because he was the vice president. I was a nobody,” said Lappos, who is now a freelance worker with nonprofit agencies. “There’s absolutely a line of decency. There’s a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It’s not cultural. It’s not affection. It’s sexism or misogyny.” Lappos did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters. Some Biden supporters rallied to his defense. Elizabeth Alexander, a former Senate and White House aide to Biden, wrote in a USA Today column that he supported women and was a champion for their rights even when it was not politically expedient.

604,UK's May fires defense secretary over Huawei leak - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  5:15 PM / 5 days ago","5 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May fired her defense minister on Wednesday over a leak of discussions in the National Security Council about Chinese telecoms company Huawei, the latest of her allies to be ousted from government. The sudden dismissal of Gavin Williamson, who “strenuously” denied involvement in the leak, was another blow for May, whose own premiership hangs by a thread after her failure so far to usher Britain smoothly out of the European Union. The firing also underlined how seriously her team treated the leak from the National Security Council, which discusses Britain’s national security, intelligence coordination and defense strategy, and involves only certain ministers from her cabinet to keep its talks as secret as possible. That secrecy was broken last month when the Telegraph newspaper reported Britain would allow Huawei a role in building parts of its 5G network, setting London at odds with Washington over the next generation of communications technology. Sources were forced to say that the role would be limited. In a letter to Williamson, May wrote that an investigation into the leaks had provided “compelling evidence suggesting your responsibility for the unauthorized disclosure”. “No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified,” she added after putting the “latest information from the investigation” to Williamson earlier on Wednesday. Williamson, who rose quickly up the ranks of the governing Conservative Party after backing May to become prime minister in 2016, denied responsibility. “I am sorry that you feel recent leaks from the National Security Council originated in my department. I emphatically believe this was not the case.” “I strenuously deny that I was in any way involved in this leak and I am confident that a thorough and formal inquiry would have vindicated my position.” May appointed international development minister Penny Mordaunt to succeed Williamson as defense secretary, and named prisons minister Rory Stewart to Mordaunt’s former role. Mordaunt will be Britain’s first woman defense minister. May has overseen several departures in her cabinet, with many quitting rather than being pushed.  One notable exception was Boris Johnson, now one of her strongest rivals, who quit last year in protest at her plans to keep close trade ties with the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc, stirring rebellion in her party’s ranks. For some in the Conservative Party, Williamson was an odd choice for defense minister after his predecessor, Michael Fallon, quit in a sexual harassment scandal in 2017. Best known for his role as chief whip, the Conservatives’ parliamentary enforcer, Williamson coaxed lawmakers to toe the party line, sometimes by introducing them to his pet tarantula Cronus, named after the god of time who swallowed each of his children according to Greek mythology. Many in the Conservative Party felt his promotion to defense minister was little more than a prize for his role as whip, which included brokering a deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to prop up May’s government. He caused a stir last year when he told Russia to shut up and go away after a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent in the English city of Salisbury. His colleague, foreign minister Jeremy Hunt, said he was sorry over Williamson’s firing “but given the gravity of the situation there was no other alternative outcome,” the Press Association quoted Hunt as saying as he arrived in Addis Ababa. Opposition parties called for a criminal investigation into the leak, with the main opposition Labor Party describing the Conservative government as chaotic and “incapable of sorting out their own crisis”.  “Conservative infighting has undermined the basic functioning of government, and has now potentially put security at risk. The police must urgently investigate,” Nia Griffiths, Labour’s defense policy chief, said in a statement after Williamson was fired. For many Conservatives, the National Security Council leak increased doubts over how much control May had over her ministers after she offered to resign if lawmakers backed the Brexit deal she reached last year with the EU.  They did not back it and she has yet to win its approval after asking parliament three times.  Last week the culture minister, Jeremy Wright, said leaks from the NSC endangered the ability of the committee, which is made up of senior ministers and hears regularly from intelligence agency bosses, to get unequivocal and frank security advice from experts. Huawei, the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, is under intense scrutiny after the United States told allies not to use its technology because of concerns it could be a vehicle for Chinese spying.  Huawei has categorically denied this.

607,Human hedge fund managers embrace robot-rival tools to amp returns - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  7:07 PM / 6 days ago","4 Min ReadBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - Traditional stock-pickers in the hedge fund world have been struggling to justify their expenses and weak returns in recent years, as low-cost algorithmic funds have done better.  Now, human managers are starting to embrace the technologies employed by their robot rivals to improve results. Prominent hedge fund managers, investors and consultants gathered at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills this week said the industry is increasingly turning to big-data analysis, machine learning and other types of artificial intelligence to research investments or build on ideas. They insisted it is not a cost-cutting strategy to replace human managers. Rather, they are trying to improve performance with the help of technology. “There is still a role for humans to figure out regime change and to figure out disruption, but those humans tend to do better when they are aided by quantitative tools,” said John McCormick, chief executive officer of Blackstone Group LP’s alternative asset management business. Blackstone, the world’s biggest investor in the $3.3 trillion hedge fund industry, has found that the most successful ones within the analog realm are those that compliment human talent with sophisticated technology, McCormick said. That evolution was a key focus of hedge fund panels and a hot topic on the sidelines at the Milken event. Managers at firms including D.E. Shaw & Co and Citadel, plus big U.S. and global pension funds, said it is a watershed moment for the industry, driven by market trends that have put enormous pressure on active fund managers. The number of publicly traded companies has declined to about 3,500 – roughly half the number from two decades ago – offering managers fewer options to find outsize returns. Meanwhile, investors are balking at the high cost structures of hedge funds, which often charge a 2 percent fee plus 20 percent or more of gains, especially as low-cost, passive investments like index funds have produced better results. The mood worsened last year, as stock-oriented hedge funds lost about 7 percent, compared with a 4 percent decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. “There are fewer tradable opportunities,” said Eddie Fishman, chief operating officer at D.E. Shaw Group, a $50 billion hedge fund firm. “People are not looking to add to long risky assets and there is such a pressure for uncorrelated returns.” It is a much different dynamic than the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, when investors were clamoring for access to exclusive funds. A host of once-prominent hedge fund firms including Eric Mindich’s Eton Park and Richard Perry’s Perry Capital are now calling it quits. People are “looking at the hedge fund industry as a giant poker table and asking themselves who is going to lose,” said Ilana Weinstein, chief executive of the IDW Group which recruits employees for Wall Street’s top hedge funds. Other funds that focus on picking stocks, including Daniel Loeb’s Third Point, are hoping that quantitative science can help improve performance. But even as firms embrace new technologies, managers and investors said attracting and retaining top talent is still crucial. While compensation is a key motivator, is it no longer the only one. Younger recruits especially want to feel that they have a real career path with meaningful challenges, Milken attendees said. The “way to reduce the risk of firm failure is to attract other people,” said Blackstone’s McCormick, “because no one has a monopoly on the right way to invest.” Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Beverly Hills, California; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Lisa ShumakerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

608,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks higher, dollar weaker in wake of Fed statement - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  6:35 PM / 6 days ago","4 Min Read* Apple shares after consensus-busting results * Most of Europe, Asia shut for May Day holidays * U.S. dollar, Treasury yields fall (Updates with close of European markets, Fed statement) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - Global equities advanced on Wednesday for a fourth straight day of gains after the U.S. Federal Reserve held rate steady as expected and as Apple’s strong results eased concerns about earnings growth. The central bank made no move on interest rates as policymakers took heart in continued U.S. job gains and economic growth and held out hope that weak inflation will edge higher. President Donald Trump recently called for the Fed to cut interest rates and renew its quantitative easing program. “No surprises from the Fed, this is exactly what people thought,” said Stephen Massocca, Senior Vice President at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “With 3% GDP growth, you saw the ADP number today, we are heating up. It hasn’t flowed through to inflation yet so you could argue there is no need but I would think central bankers would want to get in front of any inflation.” Apple shares jumped about 7% to help lift the major Wall Street indexes on the plus side as the top boost. The iPhone maker beat depressed expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend. The gains pushed Apple closer to $1-trillion market capitalization yet again. Sentiment also received a boost from early data on the labor market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate. Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. At the start of April, earnings were expected to decline by 2%, sparking some concerns about the possible start of an earnings recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.43 points, or 0.26%, to 26,661.34, the S&P 500 gained 7.34 points, or 0.25%, to 2,953.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 48.78 points, or 0.6%, to 8,144.17. Trading was thin in Europe, with most markets closed for the May Day holiday and only London and Copenhagen open for trading. UK stocks closed lower, with London’s FTSE 100 down 0.44% as it ended at a 1-month low. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.07% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.31%. The weaker data on construction and manufacturing dented the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell. The greenback briefly pared losses after the Fed but remained weaker while 10-year Treasury yields hit their lowest since April 1. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments after the policy announcement will be closely monitored for clues on the Fed’s thinking about the state of the economy and direction of rates. The dollar index fell 0.32%, with the euro up 0.41% to $1.1261. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.4622%, from 2.507% late on Tuesday. Oil prices declined after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week. U.S. crude fell 0.59% to $63.53 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.11, up 0.07% on the day. Additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar in

610,"U.S. factory activity at two-and-half-year low, points to slowing economy - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  2:54 PM / in 6 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed to a 2-1/2-year low in April amid a sharp drop in new orders while construction spending unexpectedly fell in March, suggesting economic growth was moderating after surging in the first quarter. One of the reports from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed businesses increasingly anxious that President Donald Trump’s threats to close the U.S.-Mexico boarder would further disrupt the supply chain. Washington’s trade war with China has created bottlenecks at factories. The Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, noting solid economic growth in the first quarter, and also holding out hope that inflation will rise toward the U.S. central bank’s 2 percent target.  “The slowing manufacturing sector needs to be watched carefully as income gains are not strong enough to support solid growth,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The ISM said its index of national factory activity fell to 52.8 in April, the lowest reading since October 2016, from 55.3 in March. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ISM index dipping to 55.0 in April. The slowdown in manufacturing partly reflects sluggish global economies and continued uncertainty over the trade talks between the United States and China. A stockpile of unsold goods is also seen slowing manufacturing. The ISM said 13 industries, including machinery, computer and electronic products, furniture, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth last month. Apparel, transportation equipment and three other industries reported a contraction. Manufacturers in the electrical equipment, appliances and components industry said “there is growing concern about supply chain product flow through the southern U.S. border.” Those worries were also echoed by their counterparts in the computer and electronic products industry who said “Mexico-U.S. border crossing delays are slowing supplier deliveries.”  Machinery and transportation equipment manufacturers said they were also monitoring the situation on the U.S. southern boarder. Trump has repeatedly threatened to shut down the border because of a surge in illegal immigrants seeking to enter the United States. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.  The ISM’s new orders sub-index dropped 5.7 points to a reading of 51.7 last month. More industries reported paying less for raw materials, which suggest inflation will probably remain muted for a while. A measure of export orders also fell and factories reported a decline in hiring, with a measure of manufacturing employment falling to 52.4 from 57.5 in March.  That suggests manufacturing payrolls remained weak in April after they dropped in March for the first time since July 2017. Weak manufacturing employment in April also suggested a step-down in overall job growth last month. The government is scheduled to publish April’s employment report on Friday.  “The U.S. manufacturing sector remains under pressure,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “We expect the sector’s contribution to payrolls to be noticeably more minimal in the months ahead.” While the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased by 275,000 jobs in April, Moody’s Analytics, who jointly developed the report downplayed the surge in hiring saying it “overstate the economy’s strength.”  It was the biggest private payrolls increase in nine months and followed a 151,000 gain in March. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the government reported in its advance estimate last week, after expanding at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period. The ADP report has a poor record of predicting the private payrolls component of the government’s employment report.  Economists polled by Reuters are looking for nonfarm employment to have increased by 185,000 jobs after rising by 196,000 in March. Job growth has slowed from last year’s 223,000 monthly average pace as workers become scarce. The pace of job gains, however, remains above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at 3.8 percent in April.  A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed construction spending decreased 0.9 percent in March. Data for January and February was revised lower to account for additional projects identified as eligible for inclusion in the series. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.1 percent in March.

613,"As records fall on Wall Street, investors seek bets on economic growth - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  6:21 PM / 6 days ago","5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - As the bull market gets a new lease on life, Wall Street is growing less fretful of a U.S. growth slowdown and betting on shares of companies in sectors that will benefit from the economic up-cycle, such as industrials and financials. After tumbling nearly 20% from its peak at the end of 2018, the S&P 500 has rebounded strongly this year as U.S. economic data remain robust and the Federal Reserve has indicated a pause in interest-rate hikes. Last week’s U.S. gross domestic product reading, which put first-quarter growth at a 3.2% annualized rate, further bolstered economic sentiment. Accordingly, fears of a stock market meltdown have given way to talk of a possible melt-up. The S&P 500 has notched record highs in the past three trading sessions. As a result, shares of companies in cyclical sectors and industries - those whose fortunes ebb and flow in tandem with the economy - have grown more attractive. Indeed, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 this year. Industrials are well placed to continue their ascent, especially if the United States and China reach a trade agreement as anticipated, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. Last year’s trade tensions greatly contributed to the economic worries at the end of last year, he said. “Part of the reason for the slowdown has been trade,” he said. “You’re likely to see a rebound in demand for products from industrial companies as you see a pickup in the economy.” Adrian Helfert, director of multi-asset portfolios at Westwood Holdings Group in Dallas, has grown bullish on homebuilders, which are positioned within the consumer discretionary sector. The industry is likely to benefit from low unemployment and low inflation, he said. Indeed, as mortgage rates have eased from their levels late last year, shares of housing-related companies have risen. The PHLX Housing Index has climbed 29.3% this year, ahead of the S&P 500. Another cyclical sector, financials, has not had the same resurgence as industrials this year, but some investors believe that economic conditions could soon boost those shares as well. In March, a brief inversion of the yield curve between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes, considered a sign of an impending recession, alarmed investors. The curve has steepened since then and yields have ticked up as U.S. economic data have remained largely upbeat. The recent uptick in Treasury yields suggests that the global economy is still expanding, which would help shares of U.S. banks, said Helfert of Westwood Holdings Group. “U.S. banks have corrected much faster in terms of balance sheet size than European banks, and yields will likely continue to climb on the prospect of higher growth,” he said. If the yield curve were to steepen further, it would particularly benefit shares of small-cap banks, given their reliance on lending as a source of revenue, said Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “Until recently, they couldn’t make money doing that,” he said. “Some weight has been taken off the sector with the steepening yield curve.” As investors bet on strong returns in cyclical sectors, they are also confident that U.S. stocks at large will continue their run. That run could be extended, some believe, as investors who remain on the sidelines put more money into stocks. Despite this year’s gains, investors have largely poured money into bond funds at the expense of equity funds. U.S.-based equity mutual funds posted $3.64 billion of cash withdrawals in the week ended April 24, extending their weekly outflows since mid-February, according to Lipper. Conversely, bond funds, which include taxable and municipal debt funds, brought in a net $8.8 billion last week to continue a streak of positive inflows over every full week of the year to date. That trend could soon reverse as the strengthening economy increases investors’ appetite for riskier assets, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink told Reuters in a recent interview. “I think we have the economic tailwinds to say we’re going to probably break through,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “To the extent the economy does grow at a higher rate the rest of the year, that’s going to broaden the rally out.” Reporting by April Joyner; Additional reporting by David Randall, Caroline Valetkevitch and Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Nick ZieminskiAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

614,Senior U.S. House Republican questions Trump plan to cut Central American aid - Reuters,"April 1, 2019 /  6:47 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee said on Monday that cutting aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras would make the situation there worse, not better, a sign that President Donald Trump will face bipartisan objections in Congress as he pursues the plan. “If we cut all this funding, and a lot of it, quite honestly, is seriously law enforcement that we’re doing down there ... I think it’s going to make things tragically worse, not better,” Representative Michael McCaul said in a presentation at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington. The State Department said on Saturday it was carrying out Trump’s directive to end aid programs to the three Central American nations, known as the Northern Triangle, after Trump blasted them for sending migrants to the United States. However, congressional aides noted that, since the U.S. constitution says Congress, not the president, sets spending policy, Trump cannot overrule spending bills passed by Congress, which he signed into law, without lawmakers’ approval. To obtain that approval, the administration would have to send Congress a formal notification explaining its plans for reusing the aid money and seeking lawmakers’ approval. McCaul said those who might want to cut off aid may not understand the issue, arguing that U.S. money goes to addressing the problems that prompt migrants to leave their countries. “I don’t think they thought it through,” he said.

615,Trump administration steps up effort to return asylum seekers to Mexico - Reuters,"April 1, 2019 /  3:06 PM / a month ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON/SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - The Trump administration is intensifying measures to curb the flow of Central American asylum seekers crossing into the United States from Mexico, officials said on Monday, including sending more people back to Mexico to wait for their asylum claims to be heard by U.S. courts. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency will speed up the reassignment of 750 officers to parts of the border dealing with the largest numbers of immigrants, a shift the administration first announced last week. Nielsen was cutting short a visit to Europe and flying back to Washington from London to personally oversee enforcement actions, and would visit the border later in the week, a Homeland Security official said late on Monday. She had been due to also travel to Sweden and take part in a meeting of G7 security officials in Paris. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to close the border this week if Mexico does not stop a surge of people, often traveling as families from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Closing the border would potentially disrupt millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade. His aides doubled down on the threat on Sunday but offered no specific details or timeline. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2CJe9fh) One policy put in place earlier this year to return asylum seekers to Mexico, called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), will be “immediately” expanded by “hundreds of additional migrants per day above current rates,” Nielsen said in a statement on Monday. As of March 26, approximately 370 migrants had been returned to Mexico since the program began in late January, a Mexican official said last week. People who have been returned to Mexico to wait are struggling to find attorneys and receive notice of their proceedings in U.S. courts, rights advocates said. Trump administration officials say the MPP is a way to address the failings of the current system, which they claim encourages illegal immigration. Families that claim asylum are often released into the United States because of limits on how long children can be held in detention, allowing them to stay for years while their cases move through a backlogged immigration court system even though many claims are ultimately denied. The administration is hoping policies of deterrence will reduce the number of people who turn themselves in to U.S. border agents, overwhelming the capacity of processing centers along the southern border.  CBP estimated last month that some 100,000 migrants would be apprehended or encountered at the border in March, the highest level in a decade, forcing agents to temporarily house migrants for processing in an outdoor enclosure under an international bridge in El Paso, Texas. That overflow site was shut down on Sunday after being used for a month. The total number of immigrants being released by U.S. immigration authorities in El Paso is averaging 500-600 per day, said Ruben Garcia, executive director of Annunciation House, which coordinates migrant releases with U.S. immigration authorities. Annunciation House is preparing for that total to rise to up to 1,100 during the current surge, Garcia said. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Mexico will help to regulate the flow of Central Americans  passing through its territory to the United States. He said the root causes of the phenomenon must be tackled.  In a move Democrats and Republicans in Congress have said would be counterproductive, the U.S. State Department cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador after Trump accused them, without providing evidence, of having “set up” migrant caravans and sending them north. The Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment about the expansion of MPP, and it was not clear to what extent Mexico was forewarned. In the past, Mexico has said it was accepting returned asylum seekers for humanitarian reasons although it opposes the policy. Shelters in major Mexican border cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are already at capacity because of the increase in asylum seekers in recent months and the U.S. policy of allowing only a few dozen people per day to ask for asylum at ports of entry. Last week, San Diego immigration judge Scott Simpson heard from the first Central American families that were returned to Mexico under the MPP policy. Of four families in court on Wednesday, just one had an attorney.  Yanira Esmeralda Chavez, a Salvadoran fruit seller, accompanied by her three boys did not have a lawyer as she made her case to Simpson. The family had been staying at a shelter in Tijuana, and asked to remain in the United States because they feared being sent back to Mexico. “I called the numbers on the attorney list that they provided me, but they said they cannot take my case because I am in Tijuana,” Chavez said in the hearing. “It would be better if I stay in the U.S., where I have family members.” Simpson gave Chavez two more months to obtain an attorney, and said that her family in the United States could perhaps help her find a lawyer. Throughout the day, Simpson expressed his concerns about the policy, saying he was “skeptical” about migrants getting their notices to appear in court, given the court does not have proper addresses for those returned to Mexico.

616,"Democratic hopeful Harris raises $12 million, Buttigieg pulls in $7 million - Reuters","April 1, 2019 /  12:51 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Candidates vying for the Democratic nomination to be U.S. president began on Monday to disclose how much cash they were able to raise in the first quarter of the year - an early test of their ability to organize and build support.  U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $12 million in the first three months of 2019, her campaign said late on  Monday.  Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who recently saw a bump in his standing in public opinion polls but is still considered a long-shot candidate, announced on Monday morning that he raised $7 million in the first quarter. Other candidates in the race have yet to announce their fundraising numbers, but indications are that some White House hopefuls may post totals easily exceeding those of both Harris and Buttigieg. When Beto O’Rourke, a former congressman from Texas, entered the race, he raised $6.1 million in a day. That followed U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who raised $5.9 million in his first day - and later disclosed he had raised $10 million in a week. Candidates are required by law to track and report all campaign donations. Donations collected between Jan. 1 and March 31 must be disclosed by April 15. Candidates are limited to collecting $2,800 from a single donor during the primary process.  The deadline will also put a spotlight on those who have had difficulties raising money, including U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who has struggled to gain any traction in the polls. Media outlets have reported that she has been less than successful in finding financial backing.  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren announced earlier this year that her campaign would not hold any formal fundraising events and instead rely solely on “small-dollar” donations, or contributions collected online. With such a crowded field - more than 15 Democrats have announced they are running - fundraising abilities have become an early way to prove to donors and potential supporters that a candidate is viable.  Additionally, the Democratic National Committee has said a candidate must have raised money from 65,000 different donors in order to qualify for the first debate to be held on June 26 and 27.

617,"MetLife profit beats on robust underwriting, volumes - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  8:21 PM / 6 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, buoyed by strong underwriting, volume growth, as well as higher investment income. Premiums and fees rose 2 percent to $11.26 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, while net investment income jumped 31 percent to $4.91 billion. Life insurers make money by investing premiums in stocks and bonds, hoping to earn more than what they pay out in claims. On an adjusted basis, net investment income rose 1 percent, despite relatively inactive markets, compared with a year ago, when the U.S. corporate tax cuts boosted stock markets. “Our business performance more than offset some market headwinds,” said Chief Executive Officer Michel Khalaf. Khalaf succeeds long-time chief Steven Kandarian, who announced his retirement in January. The company’s shares rose 1.3 percent in trading after the bell. MetLife grew its business across most of its regions, including the United States, Asia and EMEA. The company said it had double-digit volume growth in group, property and casualty and Latin America businesses, while it saw favorable underwriting in its group life and disability business. The insurer is strengthening its Asia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) businesses to counter intense competition in the United States, where an already saturated market is seeing the rise of fintech companies. But the insurer’s retirement business saw a 16 percent decline, as volume growth was offset by lower investment margins. Retirement business also fell at rival Prudential Financial, which reported a quarterly profit that missed analysts’ estimates, sending its shares down 3.7 percent after-hours. A slump in income from its individual annuities business also hurt Prudential, the No. 1 U.S. life insurer by assets.  MetLife’s net income rose 8 percent to $1.35 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31.  Excluding items, it earned $1.48 per share, topping analysts’ estimates of $1.27, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

618,UPDATE 1-Bank of Canada says interest rates to rise if economic headwinds dissipate - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:30 PM / 6 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds quote, details) OTTAWA, May 1 (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Wednesday interest rates would rise from their current “very low” levels if headwinds affecting the Canadian economy were to dissipate. Poloz also told the Senate banking committee that high levels of personal debt meant the economy was more sensitive to interest rates than ever. Last week, the central bank made clear rate hikes were off the table for now, given the economy was struggling to cope with lower oil prices, weak household spending and the impact of global trade conflicts. “If those headwinds dissipate, then interest rates would rise,” Poloz told the committee. A few minutes later he said “for the moment we still have very low interest rates.” The bank’s main overnight rate is 1.75 percent, below the so-called neutral range of 2.25 percent to 3.25 percent, when monetary policy neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Poloz has made clear that any future rate hikes or cuts will be heavily data dependent. (Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Tom Brown)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

619,PRECIOUS-Gold slides to one-week low as dollar revives post-Fed - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:25 PM / in 6 days","3 Min Read* Fed says no strong case for hiking or cutting rates * U.S. central bank says economic growth ‘solid’ * Dollar rebounds from one-week low * Palladium slips to 3-month low; Sliver drops over 4-month low (Updates prices, adds comments) By Brijesh Patel and K. Sathya Narayanan May 1 (Reuters) - Gold prices dropped to a one-week low on Wednesday as the dollar rebounded after U.S. Federal Reserve reduced expectations of a rate cut this year, with the safe-haven metal also pressured as the central bank signaled strong economic growth. Spot gold slipped 0.6% to $1,276.36 per ounce as of 5:02 p.m. EDT (2102 GMT), after falling as much as 0.8% to a session low of $1,272.74 earlier, its lowest since April 24. U.S. gold futures settled 0.1% lower at $1,284.20 an ounce. The U.S. central bank held interest rates steady and signaled little appetite to adjust them any time soon, taking heart in continued job gains and economic growth and the likelihood that weak inflation will edge higher. The dollar bounced back up following the announcement, having declined for the previous three sessions. A stronger dollar makes gold, which yields no interest, expensive for holders of other currencies. “The fears of a possible rate hikes were gone, that was positive for gold, then the press conference started and all the stuff came out all at once that shook up traders thoughts,” said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. The labor market remains strong and the economic activity rose at a solid rate in recent weeks, the Fed said in a policy statement. That weighed on gold, which is often used an alternative for political and financial risks. “That was quite a quick reversal for gold, it had to do with the lack of inflation according to Powell, less worries about Brexit and on the report that there could be a deal with China, which rattled gold traders,” Gero added. The United States and China are nearing a trade deal, Politico reported on Wednesday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries completed “productive” talks in Beijing. “We have economic numbers that are fairly well supported, equity markets are strong, gold doesn’t tend to perform particularly well in these situations as opportunity cost is associated with holding the zero-yielding asset,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities in Toronto. U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above economists’ expectations and the most since last July, a report by a payrolls processor showed on Wednesday. Among other metals, silver fell to a more than four-month low of $14.57, while platinum prices dropped 2.8% to $861.50, its lowest in nearly a month. Palladium slipped 2.8% to $1,349.50 per ounce, after touching its lowest level since Jan. 25 at $1,309.67.

620,U.S. Fed sees no strong case for hiking or cutting rates - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  5:06 AM / 6 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady and signaled little appetite to adjust them any time soon, taking heart in continued job gains and economic growth and the likelihood that weak inflation will edge higher. “We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment; we don’t see a strong case for moving it in either direction,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference following the  end of the central bank’s latest two-day policy meeting.  Overall, he said, “I see us on a good path for this year.”  Fed policymakers said ongoing economic growth, a strong labor market and an eventual rise in inflation were still “the most likely outcomes” as the U.S. expansion nears its 10-year mark. “The labor market remains strong ... economic activity rose at a solid rate” in recent weeks, the Fed said in a policy statement a day after President Donald Trump called on it to cut rates by a full percentage point and take other steps to stimulate the economy.  The policy statement, and particularly Powell’s insistence the Fed saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut in response to weak inflation, prompted a modest selloff in stock markets and pushed bond yields higher. The S&P 500 index fell 0.75 percent, its largest daily decline since mid-March. Interest rate futures also reversed direction, signaling a lower degree of confidence the next Fed move would be a rate cut, exactly the point Powell was driving at in a “stay-the-course” message, said analysts at Cornerstone Macro. “Nothing of what the (Federal Open Market Committee) did today ... should be read as a signal that a future change in policy is coming.”      The Fed also trimmed the amount of interest it pays banks on excess reserves to 2.35 percent from 2.40 percent in an effort to ensure its key overnight lending rate, the federal funds rate, remains within the current target band. The chief concern flagged in the policy statement was the currently “muted” level of inflation, which continues to fall short of the Fed’s 2 percent target. The statement suggested a recent decline in inflation may be more persistent than expected, and was no longer to be blamed simply on falling energy prices.  The most recent data showed a measure of underlying inflation running at 1.6 percent, which would be a problem if it meant households and businesses had doubts about the economy’s strength and were less willing to spend and invest. Powell told reporters the decline in so-called core inflation was likely mostly due to transient factors, and he predicted it would rise back to the 2 percent target.  “If we did see inflation running persistently below (the target), that is something that we would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy,” he said.  But for now, the Fed chief said, low inflation allows the central bank to be “patient” in deciding on any further changes to its overnight benchmark lending rate, which it left in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent on Wednesday. “He is making the case that a rate increase is possible, not a foregone conclusion it’s a cut only,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. The Fed raised rates four times in 2018 and, as late as December, had anticipated further rises in borrowing costs this year. Early this year it halted its tightening campaign on concerns about weak data in the United States and abroad. The federal funds rate is the amount banks charge each other for overnight loans, and is the rate the Fed targets as its main way of controlling other borrowing costs in the economy. It neared the upper end of the target range last week, prompting the change in the interest paid on excess reserves. Wednesday’s policy decision was unanimous, a sign that the Fed remains steady in its pledge to keep interest rates unchanged until incoming economic data provide a compelling reason to do otherwise.

621,Illinois constitutional amendment on income tax rates clears state Senate - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:22 PM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadCHICAGO (Reuters) - The Illinois Senate on Wednesday voted to put a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot to replace the state’s flat income tax with graduated rates in order to raise more than $3.3 billion a year for the financially shaky state. The measure, which now heads to the House, is the main component in Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker’s plan to address Illinois’ fiscal woes, which include a huge unfunded pension liability and a chronic structural budget deficit that have dropped the state’s credit ratings to a notch or two above junk. The Democrat-controlled Senate passed the resolution in a 36-22 vote. If approved by a required three-fifths majority vote in the House, which is also run by Democrats, the amendment would appear on the November 2020 ballot. Related bills contingent on voter approval of the amendment were also approved in the Senate. They would create a graduated income tax rate structure, freeze school property taxes under certain circumstances, and repeal Illinois’ estate tax. Individual income, currently taxed at a flat rate of 4.95 percent, would  be taxed at rates of 4.75 percent for the lowest incomes, rising to as much as 7.99 percent for high incomes, under the Senate bill, raising $3.325 billion in additional revenue. House action on the constitutional amendment “will commence as events warrant,” according to Steve Brown, a spokesman for House Speaker Michael Madigan, who supports the move to graduated income tax rates. The legislature’s spring session is scheduled to end May on 31. House Republican Leader Jim Durkin called the Senate votes “another step towards handing a blank check over to the Democrats and their reckless spending habits.” Pritzker, who took office in January, pitched the graduated tax plan as a way to help address a $133.5 billion unfunded pension liability and fund critical state services. In the meantime, his proposed $39 billion budget for fiscal 2020 relies on $1.1 billion in new revenue if lawmakers legalize recreational marijuana and sports betting and pass other measures.  “I applaud the Senate taking a major step forward to create a fair income tax system in Illinois, ensuring that 97 percent of taxpayers will pay the same or less and only those making $250,000 will pay more,” Pritzker said in a statement.

622,Wall Street drops after Fed chair dampens rate-cut hopes - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:46 AM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Wednesday and the S&P 500 snapped a three-day streak of record high closes as comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to dampen hopes the central bank could move later this year to cut interest rates. In its policy announcement, the Fed held rates steady as expected and struck a cautious tone on inflation. But Powell, speaking following the Fed statement, said a decline in inflation this year could be due to transitory factors. That seemed to throw cold water on views by some in the market that the Fed might make a preemptive bid to head off lower inflation or a recession by cutting rates. As Powell spoke, traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures began trimming bets the Fed will cut rates before the end of the year.  “The fact that he’s basically saying ‘we aren’t closer to a cut then we were before’ made the market sell off,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Stocks had been higher for much of the session and the S&P 500 hit an intraday record early, driven by a jump in shares of Apple Inc. The company late on Tuesday reported quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates despite a record drop in iPhone revenue.  It also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and raised its cash dividend by 5%. Apple’s stock ended up 4.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.77 points, or 0.61%, to 26,430.14, the S&P 500 lost 22.1 points, or 0.75%, to 2,923.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.75 points, or 0.57%, to 8,049.64. Selling was broad-based as nearly every S&P 500 sector ended the day lower. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 84 new highs and 52 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.44 billion shares, compared to the 6.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

624,Dollar rises as Fed's Powell cools bets on rate-cut - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  7:51 AM / 6 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose against a basket of other currencies on Wednesday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank’s current policy stance is appropriate, reducing expectations for a rate cut. The greenback rebounded from earlier losses tied to a disappointing report on U.S. manufacturing activity. “The dollar turned higher after Mr. Powell indicated that the forces weighing on inflation may prove temporary,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. “The chairman’s remarks skewed the Fed’s overall tone today as more hawkish than dovish.” In March, signaled it would not raise rates in 2019. Downbeat domestic and overseas figures have now stoked speculation policy makers could reduce key U.S. rates to avert a recession. “We think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment; we don’t see a strong case for moving it in either direction,” Powell said in a press conference after the Fed’s two-day policy meeting. In late U.S. trading, an index that tracks the dollar against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was up 0.21% at 97.679. Interest rates futures implied traders now see a 55% chance of a Fed rate cut at year-end, down from 66% late on Tuesday, according to CME Group’s FedWatch program. Earlier, the dollar slipped after the Institute for Supply Management said its barometer on the U.S. factory sector deteriorated in April to a 2-1/2 year low. The surprise downturn was offset by a report from ADP that U.S. companies added 275,000 workers last month, the most in nine months.     Some of the dollar’s gains in April came against the euro, on growing concerns about a slowdown in the euro zone economy. However, relatively strong euro zone economic data on Tuesday prompted some hedge funds to cover short positions in the euro, lifting it above $1.12. The euro extended gains before Powell’s press conference. It hit a one-week high at $1.125 before falling 0.21% to $1.11925. The dollar ended little changed at 111.415 yen, rebounding from a low of 111 yen.

626,"World stocks fall, dollar gains on Powell comments - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  9:27 AM / in 6 days","5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equities lost ground on Wednesday, snapping a three-day winning streak after the U.S. Federal Reserve held rates steady as expected but comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cast doubt on whether the central bank’s next move would be a rate cut. The Fed made no move on interest rates as policymakers took heart in continued U.S. job gains and economic growth and held out hope that weak inflation will edge higher. Stocks initially added to gains, U.S. Treasury yields fell and the dollar stayed weaker after the statement. However, all reversed course after comments from Powell suggesting a recent decline in inflation could be transitory. Traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures eased off on bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates before the end of the year, but are still expecting a cut by as early as the Fed’s December meeting. “In the statement the Fed worried about inflation being below their target, but in the press conference Powell said they view that weakness as transitory and they aren’t leaning more towards a cut then they were before,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. “So the fact that he’s basically saying we aren’t closer to a cut then we were before made the market selloff a few points.”  President Donald Trump recently called for the Fed to cut interest rates and renew its quantitative easing program.  Early gains were supported by gains in Apple, which rose more than 7% before closing up 4.91% as the top boost to each of the major indexes on Wall Street. The iPhone maker beat depressed expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend. The gains pushed Apple closer to $1-trillion market capitalization yet again. (Graphic: Apple back in the $1 trillion race  link: tmsnrt.rs/2When53). Sentiment also received a boost from early data on the labor market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate.  Still, reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. At the start of April, earnings were expected to decline by 2%, sparking some concerns about the possible start of an earnings recession.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 162.84 points, or 0.61%, to 26,430.07, the S&P 500 lost 22.1 points, or 0.75%, to 2,923.73 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.75 points, or 0.57%, to 8,049.64. Trading was thin in Europe, with most markets closed for the May Day holiday and only London and Copenhagen open for trading. UK stocks closed lower, with London’s FTSE 100 down 0.44% as it ended at a 1-month low. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.07% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.43%.  The weaker data on construction and manufacturing dented the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest level since April 1 after the Fed statement before changing course after Powell’s comments. The dollar index rose 0.18%, with the euro down 0.19% to $1.1194. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.5035%, from 2.507% late on Tuesday. Oil prices initially declined after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week but ended mixed as declines were tempered by the intensifying crisis in Venezuela and the  stopping of Iranian oil sanction waivers by Washington. U.S. crude settled down 0.49% at $63.60 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.18, up 0.17% on the day.  (Graphic: Global assets in 2019 link: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl).

627,Ex-U.S. Vice President Biden denies inappropriate conduct over alleged kiss - Reuters,"March 31, 2019 /  2:14 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Sunday he believed he had never acted inappropriately following allegations by a female activist that he made her feel uncomfortable by kissing her at a campaign event in 2014. “In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once - never - did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention,” Biden said.  Biden has said he does not recall the 2014 incident. The allegation was made in an online essay published on Friday by Lucy Flores, a party activist who was running to be Nevada’s lieutenant governor. Flores said Biden also touched her shoulders and smelled her hair when they appeared at an event together, making her feel uncomfortable. In his statement Biden added: “I may not recall these moments the same way, and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences, and men should pay attention. And I will.” Speaking on Sunday to CNN’s “State of the Union” show, Flores said she was glad that Biden was willing to listen but demanded that the former vice president acknowledge that his behavior was wrong. “If he’s saying that he never believed that was inappropriate then, frankly, I think that’s a little bit of a disconnect,” she said. “I want him to change his behavior. I want him to acknowledge that it was wrong.” Biden served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He has not yet said whether he will run for president in 2020, but has been expected to throw his hat into the ring soon.     The allegations may raise questions over whether the former vice president could still run, although some Democrats on Sunday defended Biden.  “Certainly, one allegation is not disqualifying but it should be taken seriously,” Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, Senate minority whip, told NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday.  White House adviser Kellyanne Conway also weighed in on the issue on Fox News Sunday, saying it was “bold” of Flores to come forward. “I would remind the audience that she shares Joe Biden’s political party....So it’s quite bold for her to go up against the highest levels of her own political party.” Reporting by Michelle Price and Humeyra Pamuk; Editing by Lisa ShumakerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

628,Trump cuts aid to Central American countries as migrant crisis deepens - Reuters,"March 31, 2019 /  1:04 AM / a month ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON/EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - The U.S. government cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras on Saturday after President Donald Trump blasted the Central American countries for sending migrants to the United States and threatened to shutter the U.S.-Mexico border. A surge of asylum seekers from the three countries have sought to enter the United States across the southern border in recent days. On Friday, Trump accused the nations of having “set up” migrant caravans and sent them north. Trump said there was a “very good likelihood” he would close the border this week if Mexico did not stop immigrants from reaching the United States. Frequent crossers of the border, including workers and students, worried about the disruption to their lives the president’s threatened shutdown could cause. At a rally on the border in El Paso, Texas, Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke denounced Trump’s immigration policies as the politics of “fear and division.” A State Department spokesman said in a statement it was carrying out Trump’s directive by ending aid programs to the three Central American nations, known as the Northern Triangle. The department said it would “engage Congress in the process,” an apparent acknowledgement that it will need lawmakers’ approval to end funding that a Congressional aide estimated would total about $700 million.  New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Trump’s order a “reckless announcement” and urged Democrats and Republicans alike to reject it. Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday that the United States was paying the three countries “tremendous amounts of money,” but received nothing in return. Mario Garcia, a 45-year-old bricklayer in El Salvador, said he was setting off for the United States regardless of the president’s threat to close the frontier. “There is no work here and we want to improve (our lives), to get ahead for our families, for our children. I don’t give a damn (what Trump says), I’m determined,” Garcia said. Garcia was one of a group of at least 90 people who left the capital San Salvador over the weekend on buses heading north, in what locals said was the tenth so-called caravan to depart for the United States since October. The government of El Salvador has said it has tried to stem the flow of migrants. The Honduran Foreign Ministry on Saturday called the U.S. policies “contradictory” but stressed that its relationship with the United States was “solid, close and positive.” Trump, who launched his presidential campaign in 2015 with a promise to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration, has repeatedly threatened to close the frontier during his two years in office but has not followed through. This time, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other U.S. officials say border patrol officers have been overwhelmed by a sharp increase asylum seekers, many of them children and families who arrive in groups, fleeing violence and economic hardship in the Northern Triangle. March is on track for 100,000 border apprehensions, Homeland Security officials said, which would be the highest monthly number in more than a decade. Most of those people can remain in the United States while their asylum claims are processed, which can take years because of ballooning immigration court backlogs. Nielsen warned Congress on Thursday that the government faces a “system-wide meltdown” as it tries to care for more than 1,200 unaccompanied children and 6,600 migrant families in its custody. Trump has so far been unable to convince Congress to tighten asylum laws or fund his border wall. He has declared a national emergency to justify redirecting money earmarked for the military to pay for the wall. Mexico has played down the possibility of a border shutdown. Its foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, said the country is a good neighbor and does not act on the basis of threats. It was not clear how shutting down ports of entry would deter asylum seekers because they are legally able to request help as soon as they set foot on U.S. soil. But a border shutdown would disrupt tourism and U.S.-Mexico trade that totaled $612 billion last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A shutdown could lead to factory closures on both sides of the border, industry officials say, because the automobiles and medical sectors especially have woven international supply chains into their business models.

629,O'Rourke holds rally near Mexican border that Trump threatens to shut - Reuters,"March 30, 2019 /  10:05 AM / a month ago","4 Min ReadEL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke held a major rally in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday, a city thrust to the center of America’s immigration debate by President Donald Trump and the U.S government this week. O’Rourke, a former congressman from El Paso, kicked off a series of three rallies in Texas in his bid to become the Democratic nominee a day after Republican Trump threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico as soon as next week. Speaking in El Paso, a few hundred yards from the border with Mexico, O’Rourke decried the Trump administration’s immigration policies and the president’s call for a border wall. “We’ll find security not through walls,” he declared to cheers from several hundred supporters as he officially launched his presidential campaign.  Before switching to Spanish to finish his speech, O’Rourke denounced what he called Trump’s policies of “fear and division” and accused the president of seeking “to keep us apart and to make us afraid of one another.” “Let’s remember, every single one of us are fellow human beings and deserve to be treated like fellow human beings,” he said. O’Rourke’s rally in El Paso was long-planned, but the city became central to America’s immigration debate this week. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan told reporters in El Paso on Wednesday the southern border system was at breaking point because of the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border each day. Trump, who is still determined to build a barrier along parts of the southern border, said on Friday: “There’s a very good likelihood that I’ll be closing the border next week, and that will be just fine with me.” Trump has repeatedly said he would close the U.S. border with Mexico during his two years in office. His latest threat had workers and students who frequently cross the border worried about the potential disruption to their lives. Trump and O’Rourke held dueling rallies in February in El Paso, which is already divided from Mexico by steel fencing. Trump wants it reinforced and hundreds of miles of additional fencing built along the border. O’Rourke opposes any new border structures and opposition to Trump’s border wall and immigration policies has been a centerpiece of his campaign. “We are safe not despite the fact we are a city of immigrants and asylum seekers - we are safe because we are a city of immigrants and asylum seekers,” O’Rourke said in El Paso on Saturday. O’Rourke, who announced his White House campaign on March 14, shot to national prominence last year in an unexpectedly close race against incumbent Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz. His Texas rallies will be watched via livestream at more than 1,000 locations across America, according to his campaign. More than a dozen contenders are fighting to become the Democratic Party’s candidate to take on Trump in 2020. The O’Rourke campaign sent multiple requests to potential supporters for campaign donations before his rallies in El Paso, Houston and Austin on Saturday, a common practice among presidential hopefuls. The messages stressed the importance of donating before Sunday, the deadline for first quarter fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. O’Rourke, 46, smashed fundraising records as a Senate candidate and raised $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his presidential campaign, the largest first-day haul of any announced candidate this year. However, he has struggled to see a strong campaign work ethic translate into a significant boost in early polling. O’Rourke trails former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders by double digits, according to early polls among Democratic voters. Analysts warn that polls this early, before the first nominating votes are cast in Iowa in February 2020, are unreliable. Biden has yet to join the race, although he is expected to announce his presidential candidacy soon.

630,Vegan burger maker Beyond Meat raises price range in upsized IPO - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:01 AM / in 6 days","2 Min Read (This April 30 story corrects first paragraph to say company will debut on Thursday, not Wednesday.) (Reuters) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat Inc on Tuesday increased the expected price range and size of its initial public offering, ahead of an expected market debut on Thursday, indicating strong investor demand. The company said it expects to offer 9.63 million shares, up from 8.75 million shares and the IPO to be priced between $23 and $25 per share, up from $19 and $21 per share, its latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  The higher end of the indicative price range gives the company a market value of $1.49 billion, up from $1.21 billion earlier. Plant-based meat substitutes have been gaining popularity as more attention is focused on the environmental hazards of industrial ranching. The Los Angeles-based company in early January announced it was rolling out its plant-based burger at fast-food chain Carl’s Jr. Investors in Beyond Meat include actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates. Tyson Foods Inc, the no. 1 U.S. meat processor, owned a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, but last week said it sold its investment in the vegan burger maker, as it looks to develop its own line of alternative protein products. Beyond Meat’s net loss narrowed marginally to $29.89 million in the year ended Dec. 31, from $30.38 million a year earlier. Net revenue more than doubled to $87.93 million in the same period. The company expects to start trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “BYND”. Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan, Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters to the IPO.

631,Trump threatens closure of U.S.-Mexico border next week to stem asylum surge - Reuters,"March 29, 2019 /  4:01 PM / in a month","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON/PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico next week, potentially disrupting millions of legal border crossings and billions of dollars in trade, if Mexico does not stop immigrants from reaching the United States. “There’s a very good likelihood that I’ll be closing the border next week, and that will be just fine with me,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump has repeatedly said he would close the U.S. border with Mexico during his two years in office and has not followed through. However, this time the government says it is struggling to deal with a surge of asylum seekers from countries in Central America who travel through Mexico. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials warned that traffic with Mexico could slow as the agency shifts 750 border personnel from ports of entry to help process asylum seekers who are turning up between official crossing points. “Make no mistake: Americans may feel effects from this emergency,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement. Nielsen said the personnel shift would lead to commercial delays and longer waiting times at crossing points. Some of those delays were already being felt on both sides of the international border. On Friday afternoon, the wait was longer than usual on the Mexican side of the crossing between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso, Texas, with long lines of freight trucks carrying goods from Mexican factories into the United States, according to a Reuters witness. One driver said she had been stuck in line for three hours on her way to her job in the United States. Nielsen and other U.S. officials say border patrol officers  have been overwhelmed by a dramatic increase in asylum seekers, many of them children and families who arrive in large groups fleeing violence and economic hardship in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. March is on track for 100,000 border apprehensions, DHS officials said, which would be the highest monthly number in more than a decade. Most of those people can remain in the United States while their asylum claims are processed, which can take years because of ballooning immigration court backlogs. Nielsen warned Congress on Thursday that the government faces a “system-wide meltdown” as it tries to care for more than 1,200 unaccompanied children and 6,600 migrant families in its custody. Mexico played down the possibility of a border shutdown. “Mexico does not act on the basis of threats. We are a great neighbor,” Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter. Mexican Senator Ricardo Monreal, who leads President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s party in the chamber, said in a statement on Friday he would seek to send a diplomatic note to the U.S. Congress criticizing what he called Trump’s “xenophobic attitudes.” It was not clear how shutting down ports of entry would deter asylum seekers because they are legally able to request help as soon as they set foot on U.S. soil. But a border shutdown would disrupt tourism and commerce between the United States and its third-largest trading partner, with trade totaling $612 billion last year according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  “We’d be looking at losses worth billions of dollars,” said Kurt Honold, head of CCE, a business group in Tijuana, Mexico, in response to Trump’s threat. “It’s obvious he’s not measuring what he says.” A shutdown could lead to factory closures on both sides of the border, industry officials say, because the automobiles and  medical sectors have woven international supply chains into their business models.  “We are Siamese twins - we are so entangled together,” said Alan Russell, chief executive of the Tecma Group, an outsourcing firm. Lean hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell 5.7 percent on worries that the border closure would disrupt exports to the top U.S. pork market. U.S. ports of entry recorded 193 million pedestrian and vehicle-passenger crossings last year, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. As president, Trump has legal authority to close particular ports of entry but he could be open to a legal challenge if he decided to close all of them immediately, said Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Democratic President Barack Obama.  Trump is trying to convince Congress to sign off on a revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that his administration negotiated last year. Trump launched his presidential bid in June 2015 with a promise to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug runners into the United States.  He said on Friday Mexico should do more to prevent Central American migrants from reaching the United States. “It’s very easy for them to stop people from coming up, but they don’t choose to do it,” he said.  Lopez Obrador said on Thursday tackling illegal immigration was an issue chiefly for the United States and the Central American countries to address. Trump has so far been unable to convince Congress to tighten asylum laws or fund a proposed border wall, one of his signature policies. He has declared a national emergency to justify redirecting money earmarked for the military to pay for building a wall.

632,"Georgia lawmakers pass heartbeat abortion ban, joining four other U.S. states - Reuters","March 29, 2019 /  9:01 PM / a month ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature on Friday passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States, outlawing abortion if a doctor is able to detect a heartbeat. The state’s House of Representatives passed the bill with a 92-78 vote, sending it to Republican Governor Brian Kemp, who is expected to sign it into law. The state Senate previously passed the measure. “Georgia values life. We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The legislature’s bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state,” Kemp said in a Twitter post.  Shortly after the passage of the bill, the Democratic Party in Georgia said that it has started an initiative to recruit candidates to challenge Republicans who supported the legislation.  “Republicans have shown that they can’t be trusted to make decisions on behalf of Georgia women, Georgia’s healthcare system or Georgia’s economy,” said Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia said in a statement. Georgia currently allows abortions up to 20 weeks into pregnancy. Measures such as this one have been passed in Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee over the past year. But judges in Iowa and Kentucky blocked similar laws earlier this month. Activists on both sides of the issue say the laws are aimed at getting a case sent to the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge to Roe v. Wade, the court’s 1973 landmark decision, which said women have a constitutional right to an abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union in Georgia warned that it will sue if Kemp signs the bill. “If ... Kemp signs this abortion ban bill into law, the ACLU has one message: we will see you in court,” Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, said in a statement.

633,Republicans push easing U.S. Senate rules to help Trump nominations - Reuters,"March 29, 2019 /  7:52 PM / in a month","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. Senate will attempt to alter its rules next week in order to accelerate the confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominees for some judgeships and sub-Cabinet level positions in his administration. Democrats, who control 47 of the Senate’s 100 seats, have slowed the confirmation of scores of such appointees.  Historically, the Senate has provided more procedural protections for the minority party than in the House of Representatives in the hope of forcing more-reasoned legislating, and fostering compromise.  But both parties over the last several years have complained that the rules were being misused, leading to gridlock. Before they lost their majority control of the Senate at mid-term elections in 2014, Democrats also took steps to speed up most executive and judicial branch nominations by limiting the influence of the minority party. Now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell aims to stage a vote early next week to reduce the time allowed for debating nominations from 30 hours to two hours. “It would allow the administration, finally, two years into its tenure, to staff numerous important positions that remain unfilled, with nominees who have been languishing,” the Republican leader said on Thursday. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer fired back saying, “This is just another step in his (McConnell’s) effort to limit the rights of the minority and cede authority to the administration.” If the rules change is made, it would apply to district court judges, the lowest rung of the judiciary, and would not affect nominations for vacancies in the Supreme Court and appeals courts.  It would also not apply to cabinet-level executive positions and some independent boards and commissions, McConnell noted. In 2017, McConnell changed the rules to make it easier to confirm Supreme Court justices by requiring only a simple majority vote in order to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump’s first nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Initially, McConnell would need the cooperation of Democrats to win the rules change. An aide to McConnell would not comment on whether Republicans would employ a more partisan parliamentary maneuver to accomplish the change - one that could be done without any Democratic support - if his initial gambit fails. Despite McConnell’s protests of Democratic intransigence, during the first two years of Trump’s presidency the White House has focused on filling influential appeals court judgeships - nominations that would not be subject to the rules change.  (Click here to see a graphic showing Trump's appeals court appointments: tmsnrt.rs/2Vxf9tL) Trump, a Republican, has so far won confirmation of 37 appeals court judges in little over two years, including seven in the last month. By comparison, Democratic President Barack Obama appointed 55 appeals court judges in the entire eight years he was in office. He appointed 16 in his first two years, compared with Trump’s 30. For district court nominees, the lowest rung in the judiciary, Trump has appointed 53 during his first two years in office, while Obama won 44 at the same point in his presidency. Trump has also installed two Supreme Court justices, as did Obama in his first two years in office. McConnell enraged Democrats in 2016 when he refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote on Obama’s choice of Merrick Garland to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. At the time, McConnell said that choice should be made by the winner of the November 2016 presidential election, which turned out to be Trump.

Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 5.3% after the company said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue. The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%, putting it on course to reclaim $1 trillion in market capitalization. Apple’s shares boosted the S&P 500 index, which clocked another record closing high on Tuesday and registered its best four-month rally in nearly nine years. The technology sector gained about 0.7%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. “Many were expecting an earnings recession and we haven’t had that and we’re still positive on growth,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “It’s been a good earnings season overall, Apple could potentially be positive for the tech sector overall.” Analysts are now more optimistic on first-quarter earnings growth and expect a 0.5% rise compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 305 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 76% have topped Wall Street estimates. Besides a largely upbeat earnings season, recent gains in shares have also been powered by positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Investors will also look for direction on monetary policy when the Fed concludes its two-day meeting later in the day. The central bank is largely expected to keep borrowing costs unchanged and maintain a ‘patient’ monetary policy stance, despite President Donald Trump’s call to cut rates. The financials sector, which tend to benefit from a rising rate environment, rose 0.24%, with S&P banks up 0.46%. At 9:57 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 49.55 points, or 0.19%, at 26,642.46, the S&P 500 was up 3.71 points, or 0.13%, at 2,949.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 27.01 points, or 0.33%, at 8,122.40. CVS Health Corp jumped 4.2% after the drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting a quarterly profit beat. Hilton Worldwide Holdings gained 6.4%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the hotel operator reported quarterly revenue above analysts expectations. The healthcare sector fell 0.6%, as shares of Amgen Inc fell 4.2% after the world’s largest biotech reported first-quarter revenue that was unchanged from a year ago. In economic data, ADP’s National Employment Report showed private employers added 275,000 in April, higher than consensus estimate of 180,000 additions. The private survey comes ahead of the much anticipated government jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared to March. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.39-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.03-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 58 new highs and 21 new lows.

638,"U.S. firms hire 275,000 workers in April, most nine months: ADP - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  12:41 PM / 6 days ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above economists’ expectations and the most since last July, supporting the view of a solid domestic labor market, a report by a payrolls processor showed on Wednesday. April’s robust figure might be overstating the strength of the jobs sector due to technical factors, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics which jointly developed the employment report with ADP. Job growth last month was likely in the 175,000 to 200,000 range, which is the current consensus range among economists, Zandi said on a conference call with reporters. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 180,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from 141,000 to 225,000. Private payroll gains in the month earlier were revised up to 151,000 from an originally reported 129,000 increase. While the overall labor market is “fine,” it is slowing, Zandi said. The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department’s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for U.S. private payroll employment to have grown by 180,000 jobs in April, down from 182,000 the month before. Total non-farm employment is expected to have changed by 185,000. The unemployment rate is forecast to stay steady at the 3.8 percent recorded a month earlier.

639,"Investors in leveraged loans, seduced by strong returns, ignore concerns - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  1:57 PM / in 6 days","5 Min ReadBEVERLY HILLS, Calif, May 1 (Reuters) - Bankers and investors who use leveraged loans to fuel deals were bullish on the market’s prospects at a conference this week, shrugging off concerns that lax underwriting or rapid growth poses a threat to the financial system. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to stop raising interest rates helped reverse a downturn in the leveraged-loan market that began in late-2018, major players said at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills. As investors look for high yields, leveraged loans packaged into securities can offer an attractive risk-return, they said. “Leveraged loans, by and large, are cheap and a very good place to invest capital,” David Miller, global head of credit at Credit Suisse, told a panel at the conference. Leveraged loans tend to be used by private equity firms to fund acquisitions of highly indebted companies with weak credit ratings. Banks fund the loans and then package them into securities known as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs. Insurers, pension funds, wealthy individuals and other investors buy portions of those securities. The leveraged lending market has grown to over $2 trillion in the United States, according to credit rating agency Moody’s. That is up about 80 percent over the past eight years, making the leverage loan market bigger than the junk-bond market. The expansion has been fueled by a combination of low interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis and a booming U.S. economy. As demand has strengthened, underwriting standards have slipped. Deals tend to have higher ratios of debt-to-earnings, and often feature “covenant-lite” terms, meaning investors in CLOs have fewer protections if a borrower defaults. Some credit analysts and financial regulators have expressed concerns, warning that leveraged loans could pose a threat to financial stability. That is especially true, they have said, if the United States faces an economic slowdown. “It’s been a systemic risk for a long time,” said Moody’s analyst Andrea Usai. “Most of the risk is with the non-banking sector, but banks are part of a very connected financial system and if there were a problem it could ultimately hurt them.” Banks are exposed both through their direct lending to companies and their funding of non-bank lenders, Usai said in an interview. Worries about how a leveraged-loan downturn would affect the banking industry intensified after the Trump administration eased leveraged-loan standards for big banks last year. Lenders may need several months to offload exposure, which puts them at risk if the market freezes up. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp are the biggest providers of leveraged loans among U.S. banks, with each boasting market share of 11 percent, according to credit ratings agency DBRS. Wells Fargo & Co is close behind with 8 percent market share, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Barclays PLC have smaller, but rapidly growing shares. As fears about a potential U.S. recession percolated toward the end of 2018, the market for funding and selling leveraged loans all but dried up. Total leveraged lending in the final quarter of 2018 fell to more than a 2-1/2-year low, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. But as the Fed adopted a more dovish stance on fiscal policy, the market heated up again. CLOs arranged this year in the United States totaled $39.4 billion through April 19, in line with the $38.7 billion sold during the same period last year, according to data from LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. Milken conference attendees who are active in leveraged loans said the market can withstand a downturn, pointing to strong performance during the global financial crisis a decade ago. “There were no problems then and that was during the worst time in history,” Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman told Reuters. Others were less certain about long-term performance, especially given a deterioration in underwriting standards, but felt the returns are too strong to ignore. “They’ll behave well over the next three to five years,” said Michael Hintze, chairman of the asset-management firm CQS. “Whether they’ll behave well over the next 10 years, we’ll see.” (Reporting by Matt Scuffham.

644,"O'Rourke to rally in his native Texas, where tough 2020 presidential primary awaits - Reuters","March 29, 2019 /  10:09 AM / in a month","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke will hold campaign rallies on Saturday in his home state of Texas, where he faces far different challenges in the 2020 race from those of his underdog U.S. Senate run in 2018. O’Rourke’s campaign hopes the former congressman’s personal ties to delegate-rich Texas give him a critical early boost in the large Democratic field fighting for the party’s nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump. But the primary is hardly a lock for the native son. In the unexpectedly close race against incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz that earned O’Rourke national prominence last year, he was the lone Democrat competing against a Republican figure reviled by Democrats nationally. Now, O’Rourke, 46, faces a diverse slate of accomplished and well-funded rivals hunting for the same votes, especially among the state’s African-American and Hispanic communities. “It’s a much different animal this time,” said Colin Strother, a Texas-based Democratic strategist who has worked on state and federal races but is unaffiliated with a 2020 presidential campaign. “He’s going to have rivals who are women candidates, women of color, male candidates of color, policy experts. He can’t campaign on the nostalgia of nearly beating Ted Cruz.” Texas is a big prize in the Democratic presidential nominating battle. The state is one of many holding primary votes on “Super Tuesday” on March 3. California moved its primary up to that date, giving more influence to minority voters in the country’s two most populous states than in recent election cycles. There are a combined 82 delegates up for grabs in predominately white Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote, according to the Democratic National Committee, which oversees the nominating contest. Texas and California have a combined 757. To become the nominee, a candidate must accumulate 1,885 delegates. Democratic rival Kamala Harris, a U.S. senator from California and the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, has made clear she intends to compete in Texas. Last week, her event at a historically black college in Houston drew a large crowd of blacks, Hispanics and whites. Texas is also home to Julian Castro, another presidential contender who served as mayor of San Antonio. Castro, who is Hispanic, has received support from three dozen elected and appointed Democrats from across Texas. O’Rourke’s campaign did not respond to an email requesting comment about the Texas primary. O’Rourke, who launched his White House campaign on March 14, returns to Texas after barnstorming early voting states including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. He will hold rallies on Saturday in his hometown of El Paso, as well as Houston and Austin. His campaign said more than 1,000 watch parties were being held across the country to view the events via livestream. Juan Carlos Huerta, professor of political science at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, said O’Rourke had an advantage in the Texas primary thanks to his statewide network and fundraising prowess. O’Rourke smashed fundraising records as a Senate candidate and raised $6.1 million in the first 24 hours of his presidential campaign, the largest first-day haul of any announced candidate this year. “He’s in a good position. He’s still formidable,” Huerta said. Some Democratic strategists said O’Rourke did not campaign hard enough to win the support of minority voters in his last contest and would have to work to change the perception that he took them for granted.  Ernest Bromley, managing director of Pescador Public Strategies, a political messaging firm targeting Latinos, said O’Rourke had ground to make up after underperforming with Latino voters, particularly along the border with Mexico. “He went to the large Hispanic counties, the border counties, and he would do these big rallies. And then he’d leave,” Bromley said, adding there was no sustained effort to turn out the Latino vote on Election Day. “Last year, I think O’Rourke could have done much better with ethnic voters,” Bromley said. “The candidates that do focus on the ethnic vote in 2020 will do well in Texas. It’s going to be really interesting.” Reporting by Tim Reid in Los Angeles; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

645,"At rally, Trump says Russia probe backers tried to steal power illegally - Reuters","March 29, 2019 /  12:12 AM / a month ago","4 Min ReadGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (Reuters) - At his first political rally since the end of the Russia collusion probe, President Donald Trump on Thursday accused backers of the investigation of trying to overturn the 2016 election and attempting “illegally” to claim power. Declaring the country “hurt” by the probe, Trump called his opponents “losers” and celebrated the fact the investigation had come to a close. “After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over,” he told a crowd of thousands at a Grand Rapids arena. “The Russia witch hunt was a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans – many of them, they suffered – with an elaborate hoax,” he said. On Sunday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr released a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s more than 300-page report about his investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. The investigation did not establish that members of Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the election. The findings delighted the president and his inner circle, who spent the first two years of his administration confronting a cloud of suspicion over how the New York businessman and political novice won the White House. With that cloud largely lifted, Trump has let loose, calling out those who supported the investigation and referring to evil acts of treason by his opponents. Trump revisited that theme at the rally, knocking the media and Democrats and calling for accountability. “These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it’s all lies and they know it’s lies,” Trump said. For the president, the rally capped off a week of rejoicing in the results of the investigation he had repeatedly called a “witch hunt,” and stewing over its origins. Advisers to Trump, who is not known to let go of grudges easily, have debated the merits of going after the president’s opponents and those he blames for sparking the investigation versus claiming a win, moving on and using the momentum of good news to bolster his bid for re-election. In the packed, noisy arena in Michigan, a political swing state that Trump wants to win again in 2020, the view of the crowd was clear.  Thousands of supporters, many of them wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats, cheered as the president railed at his opponents. But they seemed as eager to cheer him over policy issues, applauding loudly when he assured them he was building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and promised to secure the border.  The industrial state along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, helped propel Trump, a Republican, to his improbable victory in 2016. The crowd’s enthusiasm underscored the risks to Trump of going too far expounding on his chagrin over the Mueller probe. Some advisers feel his best bet is to focus on the strong economy and success in enacting administration priorities like the tax overhaul. Mueller left unresolved in his report the question of whether Trump committed obstruction of justice by impeding the Russia investigation. In his letter to Congress, Barr said he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, determined there was insufficient evidence to establish that the president committed obstruction of justice. Democrats were not satisfied with Barr’s determination and have demanded to see the report in full. Some Republicans, including Trump himself, have also voiced support for releasing it. Trump faces other investigations into his personal and business affairs from Democratic lawmakers, who now control the U.S. House of Representatives. But Democrats also risk alienating voters weary of the Russian probe. Trump told the rally his opponents now had to decide whether to keep up their “partisan investigations” or apologize to Americans and focus on issues like infrastructure and healthcare.

646,"Trump overrides advisers, backs funding for Special Olympics after uproar - Reuters","March 28, 2019 /  9:56 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump overrode his budget team and backed funding for the Special Olympics on Thursday after his proposed cuts to the athletic program drew heavy fire from both Republicans and Democrats. Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2020, which he released earlier this month, would have zeroed out funding for the Special Olympics, which has an allocation of $17.6 million this fiscal year. There was no sign that Congress was going to agree to defund the popular Special Olympics program in spite of Trump’s proposal. He had sought to cut funding last year as well and lawmakers added the funding back into the budget. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos had struggled to defend the proposal in testimony to Congress and both Trump’s Republicans and opposition Democrats had denounced the move. The Special Olympics is the world’s largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities or physical disabilities. Talking to reporters on the White House South Lawn, Trump said he had just heard about the controversy on Thursday morning. “I’ve been to the Special Olympics, I think it’s incredible and I just authorized a funding,” Trump said. “I heard about it this morning. I have overridden my people.

Apple shares jumped more than 6% to keep all three major Wall Street indexes on the plus side as the top boost. The iPhone maker beat depressed expectations despite a record drop in phone revenue, gave an upbeat assessment of its China business, said it would buy back $75 billion in shares and hiked its dividend. The gains pushed Apple closer to the $1 trillion market capitalization yet again. Sentiment also received a boost from early data on the labor market, as a report by payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 275,000 jobs in April, well above the 180,000 estimate. But gains were pared shortly after the open as reports on construction spending and U.S. manufacturing came in weaker than expected, sending conflicting signals about the strength of the economy. Earnings are now expected to show growth of 0.5% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. At the start of April, earnings were expected to decline by 2%, sparking some concerns about the possible start of an earnings recession. “Many were expecting an earnings recession and we haven’t had that and we’re still positive on growth,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “It’s been a good earnings season overall, Apple could potentially be positive for the tech sector overall.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 63.77 points, or 0.24%, to 26,656.68, the S&P 500 gained 3.98 points, or 0.14%, to 2,949.81 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.58 points, or 0.41%, to 8,128.97. Trading was thin in Europe, with most markets closed for the May Day holiday and only London and Copenhagen open for trading. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.07% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18%. The weaker data on construction and manufacturing dented the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest since April 11 ahead of the policy statement from the Fed scheduled for 2:00 p.m ET (1800 GMT). The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged as it maintains a ‘patient’ monetary policy stance amid strong economic growth, despite calls from President Donald Trump recently to cut interest rates and renew its quantitative easing program. Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments after the policy announcement will be closely monitored for clues on the Fed’s thinking about the state of the economy and direction of rates. The dollar index fell 0.19%, with the euro up 0.28% to $1.1246. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.473%, from 2.507% late on Tuesday. Oil prices declined after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude production output set a new record last week. U.S. crude fell 1.3% to $63.08 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.62, down 0.61% on the day. Additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar in

649,US STOCKS-S&P 500 at record high as Apple powers rally ahead of Fed decision - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  3:25 PM / in 6 days","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Apple up as China sales steady, upbeat on accessories * CVS jumps after raising FY profit forecast * Financials drop ahead of Fed’s interest rate decision * Indexes up: Dow 0.23%, S&P 0.11%, Nasdaq 0.37% (Updates prices, adds comments) By Shreyashi   Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar May 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index notched a fresh record high on Wednesday, as gains in Apple Inc’s shares after forecast-beating results powered a rally in technology stocks ahead of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy announcement. Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 6.37% after the company said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue. The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%. Apple’s shares boosted the S&P 500 index, which clocked another record closing high on Tuesday and registered its best four-month rally in nearly nine years. The technology sector gained about 0.86%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors. “It boils down to the fact that Apple’s earnings are certainly better and that is definitely helping things in general,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. “It’s a little hard for markets to move up or down much in one of the busiest weeks for catalysts, with 150 S&P 500 companies reporting, the Fed meeting this afternoon so you tend to get a bit of wait-and-see.” Analysts are now more optimistic on first-quarter earnings growth and expect a 0.5% rise compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Of the 305 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 76% have topped Wall Street estimates. Besides a largely upbeat earnings season, recent gains in shares have also been powered by positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Investors will also look for direction on monetary policy when the Fed concludes its two-day meeting later in the day. The central bank is largely expected to keep borrowing costs unchanged and maintain a ‘patient’ monetary policy stance, despite President Donald Trump’s call to cut rates. The financials sector, which tend to benefit from a rising rate environment, dropped 0.17%, with S&P banks off 0.23%. At 11:06 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 61.68 points, or 0.23%, at 26,654.59, the S&P 500 was up 3.31 points, or 0.11%, at 2,949.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 29.59 points, or 0.37%, at 8,124.97. CVS Health Corp jumped 5.32% after the drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting a quarterly profit beat. Hilton Worldwide Holdings jumped 7.2%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after the hotel operator reported quarterly revenue above analysts expectations. Energy stocks tumbled 0.94%, weighing the most on the S&P 500, as oil prices touched a session’s low after an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories. In economic data, ADP’s National Employment Report showed private employers added 275,000 in April, higher than consensus estimate of 180,000 additions. The private survey comes ahead of the much anticipated government jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show fewer job additions last month compared to March. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.01-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 39 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 32 new lows.

Exports from the southern Basra oilfields rose to 3.354 million bpd from 3.254 million bpd in March, it said.  Exports had fallen in March as bad weather halted the loading of crude on some days, Iraqi oil officials told Reuters at the time. From Iraq’s northern Kirkuk oilfields, exports dropped to 86,000 barrels per day in April from 99,000 in March, the ministry said, without giving a reason. The average sale price in April was $67.419 per barrel, generating around $7 billion in revenue, the ministry said. Iraq is producing below its maximum capacity of nearly 5 million bpd in line with a production-cutting agreement between OPEC and allies such as Russia aimed at supporting prices.

652,Sterling rises after PM May comments boost hopes of Brexit breakthrough - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:17 AM / 6 days ago","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - The pound hit a two-week high on Wednesday as investors sensed  in comments by Prime Minister Theresa May signs of progress in Brexit talks between the British government and the main opposition party. Sterling neared $1.31 after May said her plan to negotiate a customs arrangement with the EU was similar to that of the Labour Party and called for an end to uncertainty. The pound was one of the only major currencies to move on Wednesday with markets in Asia and in much of Europe closed for holidays, keeping trade subdued. The British currency has stuck within a range of $1.28-1.30 since Britain pushed its scheduled departure from the European Union back from March until Oct. 31. It remains unclear when, how or even if Brexit will happen. British newspapers reported on Tuesday that May wants Brexit talks with Labour, aimed at breaking an impasse in parliament over the terms of departure from the EU, to conclude by the middle of next week and that buoyed sterling. The next turning point for the currency could be a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday though markets do not expect the BOE to raise interest rates until early 2020 when there could be more clarity on Brexit. “A reduction in Brexit risks and tightening labour markets might prompt policy-makers to conclude that a rate hike might be a little closer than markets are currently expecting,” said Shaun Osborne, an FX strategist at Scotiabank. “A mildly hawkish hold should lift GBP,” he added. The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.3085 and was flat against the euro at 85.95 pence. With Japan out for a week of holidays, traders are worried that the absence of Tokyo, one of the world’s top five currency trading centres, might fuel some exaggerated moves in foreign exchange markets. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows. Despite the pound’s gains against the dollar, net positions by hedge funds in sterling slipped back into negative territory, according to the latest data.

654,Lloyd's of London plans shift to electronic exchanges - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:11 AM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Participants in the Lloyd’s of London insurance market will all move to electronic exchanges next year under proposals published on Wednesday, as the 330-year-old market  responds to competition from cheaper rivals. Lloyd’s, which has 99 syndicate members comprising British and international insurers with most of its business carried out face to face, has suffered two years of steep losses and faces a threat from the growth of other insurance centers such as Bermuda. New Chief Executive John Neal announced plans to set up two exchanges. First off the ground will be the Lloyd’s Risk Exchange, which will automate simple insurance business. A second platform will be used for complex risks, Lloyd’s said in a strategy document entitled “The Future at Lloyd’s”. Everybody would be required to join the exchanges, Neal, who became CEO last October, told Reuters in an interview. “There’s got to be one way of doing it,” he said. Lloyd’s, which started life in Edward Lloyd’s coffee house in 1688 and is known for insuring everything from ships to paintings, has been trying to modernize. It has moved some of its business on to an electronic platform, but progress has been slow.  “Our businesses need to adapt,” Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told a packed launch event. Lloyd’s aims to cut the costs of insuring standard risks to 10-20 percent of current premiums from 30-40 percent through automation, it said in the document, with pressure on the market to be quicker and cheaper. The existing electronic platform could be combined with other off-the-shelf technology to create the exchanges, said Neal. “Human connectivity is still important, complex risk does need a bespoke solution,” Neal said, though he added he would expect face-to-face business to decline.  The two-exchange model is similar to that of Deutsche Boerse, which has separate platforms for foreign exchange and for more complex derivatives, he said. Lloyd’s will also make it easier for new syndicates to set up business, for instance by allowing them to operate remotely, and will encourage different types of funding, such as private equity and hedge funds. The strategy is the result of meetings with 1,000 market participants.  One market source described it as the biggest shake-up at Lloyd’s since the early 1990s, when the market was almost brought to its knees by asbestos-related claims that wiped out many of its individual investors. “We just can’t afford to fail,” Andrew Brooks, chief executive of Lloyd’s underwriter Ascot, told the launch event, adding that this was “the first time I’ve seen the market come together and realize it needs to change its model”. Further consultation on the strategy is scheduled for May and June, Lloyd’s said, with the aim of implementing proposals from early 2020.

656,Trump weighs in on Smollett case as Chicago demands reimbursement - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  11:37 AM / a month ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the Department of Justice would “review” the uproar surrounding actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with staging a fake hate-crime attack on himself in Chicago before prosecutors abruptly dropped the case this week. Hours after Trump announced the review in a Twitter message calling the case a national embarrassment, the city sent the actor a letter demanding he reimburse police for $130,000 in overtime costs for the investigation. Smollett, who is black and gay, said two men attacked him on the street at night in January, yelling homophobic and racist slurs, pouring a chemical on him and putting a noose around his neck while shouting support for Trump. Investigators later charged Smollett with paying $3,500 to the men to stage the attack to garner public sympathy. Prosecutors dropped the charges on Tuesday, saying they stood by the accusation but that an agreement by Smollett to forfeit his $10,000 bond was a just outcome. Smollett, 36, insists he is innocent and was the victim of a real attack. Tina Glandian, one of his defense lawyers, told NBC News on Thursday that she was unconcerned by the review, saying, “To my knowledge, nothing improper was done.” The county prosecutors’ decision stunned the city’s police chief, prompted the police union to demand a federal investigation, and enraged Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, who called it a “whitewash” that made a fool of the city. Trump, a Republican, echoed those remarks on Thursday. “FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Justice. “It is an embarrassment to our Nation!” On Thursday, the mayor said he would seek to have Smollett reimburse Chicago for investigation costs, and rejected Trump’s federal review, telling the president to “sit this one out.” Chicago Corporation Counsel Edward Siskel, who heads the municipal Department of Law, sent Smollett a letter on Thursday demanding payment within seven days of more than $130,000 to cover police overtime expenses. “If the amount is not timely paid, the Department of Law may prosecute you for making a false statement to the city” under city ordinances, Siskel warned Smollett in the letter. Law Department spokesman Bill McCaffrey said enforcement of the city’s false statement code amounts to a civil action, not a criminal case, carrying a maximum fine of $1,000 plus up to three times the amount of damages to the city. The city could also seek to recover court costs, collection costs and attorneys fees, but Smollett would face no jail time, McCaffrey said. The Department of Justice declined to comment. The FBI has already had some involvement in the case, with agents investigating a threatening letter Smollett said he received prior to the attack, according to the Chicago Police Department. The initial reports of two Trump supporters attacking a gay, black celebrity drew widespread sympathy for Smollett, particularly from Democrats. That faded quickly after the actor’s arrest, and the case was seized on by some as an example of what Trump likes to deride as “fake news.” Smollett is best known for playing a gay musician on the Fox drama “Empire.” His lawyers said he hopes to move on with his career, but it remains unclear whether he will return to “Empire” after being written out of the last two episodes of the most recent season.

657,Trump's pick for No. 3 Justice Department post withdraws after Republican objects - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  9:32 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s pick to serve as the third-ranking official in the U.S. Justice Department, Jessie Liu, withdrew from consideration on Thursday after at least one Republican lawmaker objected to her past involvement with a women’s legal group, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. Liu will instead serve as an adviser to Attorney General William Barr and remain in her job as the top federal prosecutor in Washington, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.  “Jessie will be an integral part of our leadership at the Department,” Barr said in a statement. Liu served on Trump’s presidential transition team and was unanimously confirmed in 2017 by the Senate to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the largest federal prosecutors’ office in the United States. Trump said earlier this month he intended to nominate Liu to be associate attorney general - a job that involves overseeing the department’s civil litigation, including antitrust matters, civil rights, and environmental law.  But Republican Senator Mike Lee opposed her nomination due to concerns that she did not oppose abortion, Lee’s spokesman Conn Carroll said. Republicans, who generally oppose a woman’s right to abortion, hold a narrow 12-10 majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and without Lee’s support they would have had a difficult time securing a confirmation vote in the Senate. Liu served as vice president and president-elect of the National Association of Women Lawyers in 2005-2006, when the group opposed the nomination of conservative Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court and filed legal briefs supporting abortion rights, according to a person familiar with the matter. Liu told the conservative National Review earlier this month that she supported Alito’s nomination and left the group because she disagreed with its political positions.  “While we believe criticisms of Jesse are unfair, she did not want her nomination to become a distraction for the Attorney General at this critical time for the Department,” Kupec said. Liu’s office declined comment. The National Association of Women Lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Liu’s decision leaves the department’s leadership in flux as Attorney General William Barr is facing pressure from Capitol Hill to release Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and any Trump campaign ties to Moscow. The department’s No. 2 official, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, has announced his departure, and the No. 3 spot has been unfilled for more than a year.

658,U.S. energy secretary unsure if Saudi nuclear approvals came after Khashoggi killing - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  7:49 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told lawmakers on Thursday he did not know whether any of the approvals he authorized for U.S. companies to sell nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia were made after the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October last year. Perry told a Senate hearing he approved some authorizations by U.S. companies to sell preliminary nuclear power technology and assistance to Saudi Arabia since November 2017, confirming media reports by the Daily Beast and Reuters on Wednesday. The Department of Energy issued a statement later on Thursday clarifying that it had issued seven such approvals for companies wishing to participate in Saudi Arabia’s civilian nuclear power program, but pointed out that they do not permit the transfer of “nuclear material, equipment or components.” U.S. companies commonly win such approvals, known as Part 810 authorizations, for selling nuclear power know-how abroad and the documents are often kept for the public to access in a room at Energy Department headquarters.  But the ones that Perry approved for Saudi Arabia, which has been in quiet talks with the Trump administration on a wider nuclear power deal, were not made public. Perry said they contained proprietary information for the companies, the names of which have not been released.  A House of Representatives aide said that previous Part 810 approvals for Saudi Arabia made during the administration of President Barack Obama are available for public perusal.   Lawmakers from both parties have slammed the Trump administration for negotiating a deal while keeping Congress in the dark. They worry that a program without non-proliferation safeguards could eventually lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, which wants to build two reactors initially, has pushed back against U.S. limits on enriching uranium and reprocessing spent fuel, both of which are potential paths to a nuclear weapons program.  Concern grew after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year said the kingdom would pursue nuclear weapons if its rival Iran developed them.     Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat, asked Perry if any of his approvals were made before or after Oct. 2, 2018, the day that Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi was a resident of Virginia, Kaine’s state. “I don’t,” Perry told Kaine. “I don’t want to give you a date specific,” Perry said before Kaine resumed questioning. Perry told Kaine he would get back to him on the specific timing of the approvals.  Kaine has accused the Trump administration of complicity in covering up Khashoggi’s murder. A number of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have been at odds with the Trump administration over its response to Khashoggi’s killing, and a bipartisan group of senators had introduced a bill to impose sanctions on those responsible for his death. Perry, responding to another question by Kaine at the hearing, said that since 2017, the Department of Energy has received 65 applications for Part 810 authorizations and approved 37. Perry said nine were for work in the Middle East, including two for Jordan.   Perry said late last year that he had emphasized to Saudi Arabian officials it was important for them to be seen as strong on non-proliferation, but that part of the talks has centered on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive to sensitive areas in the kingdom. Senator Ed Markey, a Democrat, said on Thursday he will introduce a bill to stop the Trump administration from what he called “bypassing Congress” on nuclear technology transfer to Saudi Arabia. The legislation, which would mandate that any 810 authorizations are made available to Congress, would face an uphill battle in the Republican-led chamber.

660,Factbox: Big Democratic field taking shape for 2020 U.S. presidential race - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  5:07 PM / a month ago","12 Min Read(Reuters) - A crowded field of fresh faces and veteran U.S. lawmakers has lined up to seek the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination. The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators. A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them became the party’s nominee. Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average.  The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet. But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race. At 76, he will be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic primary, after Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden will be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House. Liberal activists criticize his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware. Biden, who relishes his “Middle-Class Joe” nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try. In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago. His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare. He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest. Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family. He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016. The first-term senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana. Her track record as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues. The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping on to store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states. O’Rourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz. O’Rourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents. But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the party’s nominating battle, O’Rourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors. The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the party’s liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy. She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid. Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as “Pocahontas.” Booker, 49, a black senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family. He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks. Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson. The third-term senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination. On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices. Klobuchar’s campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours. Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.  The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters. A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve. He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party. The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. party’s presidential nomination. Castro, 44, whose grandmother was a Mexican immigrant who immigrated to Texas, has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump’s border policies. Castro advocates for a universal pre-kindergarten program, supports Medicare for All and cites his experience to push for affordable housing. He announced his bid in his hometown of San Antonio, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. His twin brother, Joaquin Castro, is a Democratic congressman from Texas. Gillibrand, known as a moderate when she served as a congresswoman from upstate New York, has refashioned herself into a staunch progressive, calling for strict gun laws and supporting the Green New Deal. The senator for New York, who is 52, has led efforts to address sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, and she pushed for Congress to improve its own handling of sexual misconduct allegations. On the campaign trail, she has made fiery denunciations of Trump. She released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate, and has called on her rivals to do the same.  The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign. As governor, Inslee, 68, has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He has not settled on a position on Medicare for All but does support the Green New Deal backed by progressives. Inslee spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012. The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. He is the only Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brew pub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money. He previously served as mayor of Denver. The former U.S. representative from Maryland became the first Democrat to enter the 2020 race, declaring his candidacy in July 2017. Delaney, 55, plans to focus on advancing only bipartisan bills during the first 100 days of his presidency if elected. He’s also pushing for a universal healthcare system, raising the federal minimum wage and passing gun safety legislation.  The Samoan-American congresswoman from Hawaii and Iraq war veteran is the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. After working for her father’s anti-gay advocacy group and drafting relevant legislation, she was forced to apologize for her past views on same-sex marriage. Gabbard, 37, has been against U.S. intervention in Syria and slammed Trump for standing by Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. She endorsed Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign.  The entrepreneur and former tech executive is focusing his campaign on an ambitious universal income plan. Yang, 44, wants to guarantee all American citizens between the ages of 18 and 64 a $1,000 check every month. The son of immigrants from Taiwan, Yang also is pushing for Medicare for All and proposing a new form of capitalism that is “human-centered.” He lives in New York. MARIANNE WILLIAMSON The 66-year-old New York Times best-selling author, motivational speaker and Texas native believes her spirituality-focused campaign can heal America. A 1992 interview on Oprah Winfrey’s show propelled her to make a name for herself as a “spiritual guide” for Hollywood and a self-help expert. She is calling for $100 billion in reparations for slavery over 10 years, gun control, education reform and equal rights for lesbian and gay communities. In 2014, she made an unsuccessful bid for a House seat in California as an independent. Messam, 44, defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of in the Miami suburb of Miramar. He was re-elected in March.

661,Suburban Florida mayor announces Democratic bid for U.S. presidency - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  2:34 PM / a month ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - A little-known mayor of a Miami suburb announced his bid to become president of the United States on Thursday, joining an already crowded field of Democratic candidates vying to become the party’s nominee in 2020. Wayne Messam, 44, son of Jamaican immigrants, joins an unusually diverse slate of 15 other Democrats seeking to unseat President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, in November 2020. The field includes the first openly gay candidate, six women, a Hispanic man and a Samoan-American congresswoman, among other minorities. Messam defeated a 16-year incumbent in 2015 to become the first black mayor of Miramar, which has a population of about 122,000. He was re-elected in March. In his campaign launch video, Messam jogs in sleek athletic gear through sugarcane fields, describing how he went to Florida State University on a football scholarship and played on the 1993 national championship team.   After college, Messam started a construction business with his wife.  “The lack of urgency to plan for the future and take action on the crises we can see coming is the biggest threat facing our nation,” he wrote on his campaign website. Messam pledged to focus on reducing gun violence, mitigating climate change and reducing student loan debt and the cost of healthcare. Messam is the second mayor to enter the Democratic race, joining Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, population 101,000. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who came to national prominence when he ran for president in 2016, and former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to formally announce a run, are the front-runners in early polls.

662,Bill to let banks work with cannabis companies advances in U.S. House - Reuters,"March 28, 2019 /  2:10 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional panel advanced legislation Thursday that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal. The bill would provide sought-after clarity to banks across the country that want to do business with the growing industry, where companies have struggled to gain access to the financial system. The measure, which was broadly backed by a mixture of Democrats and Republicans, now proceeds to the full House, where it is expected to be passed by the Democrat-led chamber in the near future. However, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-led Senate, according to analysts. While all but 3 states allow for some form of legal cannabis use, marijuana is still illegal on the federal level. That has left banks largely unwilling to do business with businesses that sell marijuana or related enterprises, out of concern they could run afoul of federal laws. In particular, banks are wary that taking deposits from pot businesses while marijuana remains illegal at the federal level could violate anti-money laundering laws, which in turn could put at risk their federal charters or access to federal payments systems. Currently, companies in the marijuana industry have extremely limited options for dealing with their finances, with many relying on strictly cash to do business. Numerous lawmakers noted that operating exclusively in cash can be extremely dangerous, making companies a target for theft. The bill has the backing of the banking industry, where firms are eager for reassurance from the federal government they can engage in this sort of business. The American Bankers Association has told Congress it takes no stance on the legality of marijuana, but its widespread adoption by states “raises practical issues that must be addressed.” Some Republican lawmakers expressed concern over permitting banks to engage in business that is still technically illegal. If Congress wants to allow banks to get into the marijuana business, it should legalize marijuana, they said. But proponents of the bill argued that with the vast majority of U.S. states taking steps to further legalize marijuana use, it makes no sense to refuse those businesses access to banks.  “The toothpaste is out of the tube, my friends,” said Representative Denny Heck, a Democrat from Washington.

663,"Low ECB rates to stay, banks should merge: de Guindos - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  10:36 AM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - European Central Bank interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time and banks in the euro area should consolidate and step up efforts to improve profitability, ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos said on Wednesday.   “The low interest rate environment is with us for the foreseeable future and is caused in large part by durable structural factors,” de Guindos told an event in London.  “Even once monetary policy normalizes, interest rates are likely to remain below levels that were common in previous decades.” The ECB’s key deposit rate is at minus 0.40 percent and expected to remain at that level for some time given weak economic growth. De Guindos said that while mergers in the banking sector both at a national and cross border level were viable, it was essential that any combined entity can sustain profitability in the long-run.  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank said this month that their talks on an all-German merger had ended. “I do not like national champions,” de Guindos added.     While the ECB is encouraging more consolidation in the “crowded” banking sector, de Guindos said that price stability remains the central bank’s core objective. “We do not have any sort of bank profitability mandate,” de Guindos said, stressing that banks were impacted by structural factors and struggling before the ECB introduced unconventional monetary policies. De Guindos also noted that the “doom loop” link between banks and government debt was not as relevant as in the past, and the focus was now on banks’ non-performing loans. De Guindos said that he believed the extra time awarded to Britain to secure an orderly exit from the European Union would prove fruitful. “I hope we will be able to take advantage of the new period of time that British government, parliament have at its disposable to reach an orderly Brexit,” he said. On Italy, de Guindos stressed the need for reforms that would boost the country’s economic performance and help reduce debt levels. “The main recommendation is to pursue reforms that improve the effectiveness of the economy,” he said.

664,"Exports sag, UK factories report lower Brexit stockpile boost - PMI survey - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  3:26 PM / 6 days ago","4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - British factories lost some of the boost from pre-Brexit stockpiling last month while households slowed their borrowing ahead of the original deadline for the country’s departure from the European Union, data showed on Wednesday. The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) dropped to 53.1 in April from March’s 13-month high of 55.1, broadly in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Exports fell at one of their fastest rates in the past five years, reflecting a slowdown in the global economy. Uncertainty around the terms of Britain’s exit from the EU, originally scheduled for March 29, had previously prompted factories to load up on parts and materials at the fastest rate in the 27-year history of the PMI surveys. Bank of England data for March, also released on Wednesday, showed caution on the part of consumers whose spending has helped to offset weakness elsewhere in Britain’s economy. Lenders approved the fewest mortgages since December 2017 ahead of the expected Brexit date, and consumer credit growth slowed to its weakest in more than four years. However, there have been signs that the slowdown in Britain’s housing market may have bottomed out. Nationwide Building Society said house price growth picked up to an annual 0.9 percent in April, its highest since November though much slower than growth of about 5 percent at the time of the 2016 Brexit referendum. With the deadline for Brexit now pushed back to Oct. 31, the pace of factory stockpiling eased in April, though it continued to boost British output amid a broader downturn in European manufacturing. “The slowdown is less severe than we had expected,” economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said. One in five manufacturers reported that Brexit-related stock-building had continued to boost output in April. The survey’s gauge of export orders fell to its lowest since August 2018, and its second-lowest reading since October 2014. Although global demand for goods has slowed markedly over the last six months, IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty was the main factor for British factories in April. “There were also reports of overseas clients acting now to re-route their supply chains away from the UK in advance of Brexit,” said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, the firm which compiles the data. Last week a quarterly survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry showed the biggest fall in export orders since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009. Andrew Wishart of consultancy Capital Economics said he expected Britain’s manufacturing PMI to fall further, coming closer into line with a weak euro zone manufacturing PMI. “The upshot is that a hangover from Brexit preparations in the sector will weigh on GDP in Q2,” he said. Officials at the Bank of England preparing new economic forecasts for publication on Thursday are likely to note cooling producer price pressures shown in the latest PMI, echoing European Commission business surveys published on Monday. Factories raised selling prices at the slowest pace since July 2016, and their material and energy costs increased at the second-slowest pace May 2016, the PMI showed.

665,FOREX-New Zealand dollar hit by jobs data; investors eye Fed meeting - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:55 AM / 6 days ago","3 Min Read* Dollar slips ahead of Fed meeting, euro gains * Kiwi the big mover after jobs data fuel rate cut bets * Sterling rises on Brexit optimism, broad rally * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds details) By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar fell on Wednesday after weak jobs data heightened expectations interest rates would fall, as investors  waited for the end of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting. Trading was thin with holidays in much of Asia and Europe. Most currency pairs traded within tight ranges. The Fed meeting comes after strong U.S. economic data last month pushed the dollar to a two-year high. “The risk for this Fed meeting is that, unless the FOMC meets the market’s dovish expectation for their stance, we would expect another leg higher in USD,” Mizuho strategists said in a note. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, slipped in London trading, with the index at 97.381. The euro gained against the dollar to $1.1234, its highest since April 23. Strong economic data in the euro zone on Tuesday prompted some short covering from hedge funds that have been betting against the single currency. The day’s big mover was the New Zealand dollar. It fell half a percent after data showed employment unexpectedly fell in the March quarter, although the jobless rate dropped to 4.2 percent. Markets responded by betting a rate cut was more likely. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which holds a policy meeting next week, has already said its next move was likely to be down. The kiwi recovered from earlier lows and was last down 0.2 percent at $0.6663. The Australian dollar gained 0.1 percent to $0.7059 . Accommodative monetary policy throughout much of the world has kept volatility contained across financial markets and demand for riskier assets elevated. “Currencies benefiting from strong global growth combined with low inflation pressures have caught a bid,” Morgan Stanley analysts said, listing the pound and the Indian rupee as both countries are dependent on capital inflows to fund their current account deficits. Sterling extended its rally to hit a new two-week high, supported by growing optimism that the ruling Conservative and opposition Labour parties can break the Brexit deadlock in their negotiations over how to leave the European Union. The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3074, leaving it up 1.8 percent so far this week. The Bank of England holds its policy meeting on Thursday, where it is expected to keep rates unchanged. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.1 percent to 111.35 yen per dollar in quiet trading. Japanese markets are closed for a string of public holidays.

666,Bayer supervisory board to meet to discuss crisis: report - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:23 AM / in 6 days","2 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - The supervisory board of Bayer is planning an extraordinary meeting to discuss a crisis of confidence in its leadership after an investor rebuke at the German drugmaker’s annual meeting, a magazine reported on Wednesday. Citing an unnamed board member, Wirtschaftswoche magazine said the meeting would take place in the next two or three weeks: “We can’t just carry on like this,” the person said. A Bayer spokesman declined to comment. At Bayer’s annual shareholder meeting on Friday a majority of investors cast a vote of disapproval of top management’s actions. On Saturday, the supervisory board said in a statement that it unanimously stands behind the company’s management, adding that it would continue to examine the results of the AGM in the weeks ahead. On Monday, three of Bayer’s largest German investors said the drugmaker’s management needed to stay at the helm to avoid further upheaval, despite their unease over a share price slump in the wake of the company’s $63 billion takeover of Monsanto. About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. More than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the Roundup verdicts and has pointed to global regulators’ findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, is safe. On Tuesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that glyphosate is not a carcinogen, contradicting decisions by U.S. juries that found it caused cancer in people.

MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent at 0858 GMT after rising to its highest since early October, although May Day holidays across Asia and Europe meant trading was thinner than usual. In a sign of the growing appetite for riskier assets, Australian shares ended just shy of an 11-year peak and London’s blue chip FTSE 100 was up 0.2 percent after solid earnings from supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. CME E-Mini S&P 500 Futures were at record highs and Nasdaq futures were up 0.7 percent, suggesting Wall Street is poised for more gains after hitting another record close overnight fueled by optimism about first quarter earnings. Apple shares rallied after the closing bell as the iPhone maker delivered forcecast-beating numbers that soothed worries about a prolonged weakness in global corporate results. There was plenty to keep investors who were at their desks occupied: Beijing and Washington began their latest talks aimed at ending a bitter trade war and Fed chairman Jerome Powell was due to speak later following the central bank’s two-day policy meeting. The U.S. dollar against a basket of six major currencies was down slightly, trading in a tight range after hitting a one-week low ahead of the Fed news. “The risk for this Fed meeting is that, unless the FOMC meets the market’s dovish expectation for their stance, we would expect another leg higher in USD,” Mizuho strategists said in a note. The Fed is largely expected to leave U.S. borrowing costs unchanged as it seeks to balance solid economic growth against low inflation. A call from U.S. President Donald Trump for a cut in interest rates will likely be unheeded when the results of the Fed’s two-day meeting are released, but the unorthodox comments made on Twitter will increase focus on Powell at his press conference shortly after. Sentiment has improved along with global economic data - most recently from the euro-zone where data on Tuesday showed Q1 growth topped expectations. But there was some caution ahead of the summer lull with investors questioning how much longer the rally across global equities can last with better economic data and a stabilisation in earnings priced in. “Historically the more difficult half of the year starts today,” said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt. “The next six months will present plenty of geo-political challenges.” Elsewhere, commodities were mixed with base metals prices rising on hopes of a breakthrough in the U.S.-China talks, while crude oil prices eased as data showed a rise in U.S. inventories. Brent crude oil futures were at $71.55 per barrel, down 0.8 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 1.1 percent at $63.23 per barrel.

Markets in Asia and in much of Europe were closed for holiday, limiting activity in currency trading and keeping many investors on the sidelines. Sterling has stuck within a range of $1.28-1.30 since Britain pushed its scheduled departure from the European Union back from March until Oct. 31. But it hit a two-week high of $1.3049 on Tuesday after several British newspapers reported that Prime Minister Theresa May wants talks with Labour on reaching a Brexit consensus to conclude by the middle of next week. The next turning point for sterling could be a Bank of England policy meeting on Thursday though markets do not expect the BOE to raise interest rates until early 2020 when there could be more clarity on Brexit. “Given that firms will continue their preparation for Brexit and growth remains subdued, the BoE should remain on hold tomorrow. EUR/GBP will hover around the 86 pence level today ahead of the rate decision,” said Petr Krpata, an FX strategist at ING in London. The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.3070 and was flat against the euro at 85.92 pence. With Japan out for a week of holidays, traders are worried the absence of Tokyo, one of the world’s top five currency trading centres, might fuel some exaggerated moves in foreign exchange markets. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows. Despite the pound’s gains against the dollar, net positions by hedge funds in sterling slipped back into negative territory, according to the latest data.

672,Esports organization Fnatic raises $19 million for big expansion - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  5:18 AM / 6 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Fnatic, the London-based global esports team owner, has raised $19 million in new funding and restructured its leadership as it plans a major expansion, the company said on Wednesday. The company plans to further expand in Asia and North America and grow from a headcount of 150 people now to 1,000 in the next five years, founder Sam Mathews told Reuters.  It will use the investments to strengthen its teams with new nutrition and psychology programs, and physical training coaches for players - lessons Mathews said he took from the British cycling team. It also plans to launch a new line of audio equipment, particularly headsets. Esports - professional video game competitions that are watched by throngs of fans live and online - have been around for over a decade but have seen audiences and sponsorships grow significantly in the last couple of years. It has also attracted big brands looking to advertise to young fans and sponsor teams and stars, including Walt Disney Co, Hershey Co and Toyota Motor Corp. Global esports revenue will hit $1.1 billion in 2019, up 27 percent since last year amid an increase in advertising, sponsorship and media rights to competitive video gaming, according to the gaming analytics firm Newzoo. Esports will be one of “the most valuable sports in the next 10 years,” Mathews said. Fnatic, one of the oldest and largest teams in global esports, has won major titles in several games, including League of Legends and Counter-Strike. It currently fields teams in 10 different games and also sells its own line of gear and clothing. Mathews started Fnatic in 2004 with $40,000 in family funds and help from his mother, Anne.  The company previously raised about $7.5 million in financing, including from Raptor Group Holdings, founded by investment manager Jim Pallotta, co-owner of the Boston Celtics professional basketball team. In 2015, Fnatic acquired the gaming equipment maker FUNC in order to produce its own gear, including keyboards and mice, which are now sold in over 400 Best Buy stores in the United States. The new investment round was led by tech entrepreneur Lev Leviev of LVL1 Group, who also joins the board, Fnatic said in a statement. The investment round also includes British venture capital firm Beringea, Hong Kong private equity firm BlackPine, London-based investment firm Unbound and venture capitalist Joi Ito, who is also director of the MIT Media Lab. Under the new leadership structure, Mathews will be chief executive. Nick Fry, former CEO of the Mercedes AMG Formula One motor racing team, returns to Fnatic as chairman, while Glen Calvert, founder of advertising firm Affectv, was appointed chief operating officer.

673,Nadler says Barr may miss Democrats' April 2 deadline for Mueller report - Reuters,"March 27, 2019 /  10:10 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Wednesday he was very concerned that Attorney General William Barr might not submit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report to Congress by April 2 as Democrats have demanded. Nadler said he had a 10-minute phone conversation on Wednesday with Barr, who released a four-page summary on Sunday of Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Nadler said Barr would not commit to submitting the entire report to Congress. “I am very concerned that it is apparent that the Department (of Justice) will not meet the April 2 deadline that we set. And I’m very disturbed by that,” Nadler told reporters. “I asked whether he could commit that the full report, an unredacted full report with the underlying documents evidence would be provided to Congress and to the American people. And he wouldn’t make a commitment to that. I am very concerned about that,” Nadler said. Nadler said Barr agreed to testify before the Judiciary Committee. Nadler left open the possibility that Mueller may be asked to testify sometime after Barr appears. Barr said in his summary of the Mueller report that the special counsel’s 22-month investigation did not find that President Donald Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, according to Barr. Nadler said he knows the length of the Mueller - calling it “very substantial” - but he declined to reveal how many pages.

674,U.S. lawmakers squabble over demand for Trump financial records - Reuters,"March 27, 2019 /  10:05 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A request by a leading Democrat for records of Donald Trump’s financial dealings before he became president set off a partisan squabble in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday. In a letter to the chairman and chief executive officer of Mazars USA LLP, an audit and accounting firm, Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, last week requested records related to personal financial statements the firm prepared for Trump in 2011-2013.  Republican leaders on Wednesday denounced Cummings’ move as an illegitimate effort to embarrass Trump.  In his letter, Cummings cited recent testimony before his committee by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen that Trump changed the estimated value of his assets and debts on financial statements prepared by Mazars. Cohen told the committee during his testimony that Trump at times inflated the value of his assets, such as when he was preparing a bid for the Buffalo Bills National Football League team, and at times deflated them, such as when he wanted to reduce his real estate taxes. But two Republican leaders on the committee, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, who had publicly defended Trump and grilled Cohen during his testimony, on Wednesday questioned the legitimacy of Cummings’ request. They said he was seeking information about Trump’s finances going back 10 years, well before Trump ran for office, adding that it “does not appear to have a valid legislative purpose and instead seems to seek information to embarrass a private individual.” The Republicans also complained that Cummings did not consult with them before sending his letter to the accounting firm. A spokesman said the White House had no comment. Mazars did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

675,"Despite Congress' ire, Pentagon to transfer $1 billion for Trump wall - Reuters","March 27, 2019 /  9:33 PM / a month ago","2 Min ReadMIAMI (Reuters) - Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said on Wednesday he would push ahead with plans to transfer $1 billion to help fund President Donald Trump’s wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, even as he acknowledged a likely backlash from Congress. Democratic Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that the panel did not approve the proposed shift in Pentagon expenditure. Any decision to go ahead anyway could prompt Congress to create new restrictions that could impact the Pentagon in the future. Asked whether his plan was to move ahead regardless, Shanahan said: “Yes, it is.” “There are going to be consequences. I understand the position of the committees. I also have a standing legal order from the commander-in-chief,” he said. Congress could attempt to cut off the Pentagon’s authority to reprogram funds, something Smith hinted at during the hearing.  Asked whether he expected Smith to follow through, Shanahan said: “I would expect that to happen.” Still, the Pentagon insists it has the authority to shift the $1 billion.  The House failed on Tuesday to override Trump’s first veto of the “national emergency” he declared last month to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Congress has not funded. Smith told the hearing that Trump’s proposed $750 billion defense budget would not pass as it was proposed. That budget included $100 billion in a “slush fund” meant to fund ongoing wars but which the Pentagon intends to use to boost the amount of money it has available to avoid budget caps. Shanahan said losing the ability to reprogram funds could present problems for Pentagon planners, who have to shift resources around to deal with natural disasters and other emergencies.  “It’s a very difficult situation and ... we’re going to have to be artful to manage this,” he said.  “I don’t think it’s going to be easy.

676,U.S. may lose borrowing authority in second half of 2019 -Treasury - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:30 PM / 6 days ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday. Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade. The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds. “Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement. The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said. Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either.

679,PRECIOUS-Gold prices ease as equities gain before U.S. Fed decision - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  10:25 AM / 6 days ago","3 Min Read* U.S. central bank to announce rate decision at 1800 GMT * Trump, Democrats agree $2 trillion infrastructure spending * Dollar slips for fourth straight session to one-week low (Updates prices) By K. Sathya Narayanan May 1 (Reuters) - Gold inched down on Wednesday after investors developed more appetite for riskier equities before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision due later in the day. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,281.96 per ounce at 1143 GMT, while U.S. gold futures slipped 0.2 percent to $1,283.70 an ounce. “The pick up we saw in stock markets overnight is limiting demand in the gold market,” said Ole Hansen, commodity strategist at Saxo Bank. “Gold is range bound and there no major trigger right now to move higher.” Global equities were higher on Wednesday, extending the global equity market rally into a fifth month as investors cheered Apple’s strong results. Major U.S. indexes gained overnight, after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed with Democratic leaders to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure. “Gold is more focused on what equity markets are doing and if equities continue higher gold will trade lower despite a weaker dollar,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to its lowest in a week against key rivals, weakening for the fourth straight session, after posting its biggest daily percentage decline in more than a month on Tuesday. A dip in the U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated gold cheaper for investors holding other currencies. Investors are awaiting the end of a two-day meeting by the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), after the central bank ended its three-year policy tightening drive last month, ditching projections for any interest rate hikes this year. “The market is predominantly looking for no change from the Fed. The key could be the wording of the statement, for any moves away from the dovish tone from the last time,” Saxo Bank’s Hansen said. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and weigh on the dollar. “Prices are playing on the support level of $1,280, with potential for a further decline to $1,266 in case of a hawkish Federal Reserve,” ActiveTrades Chief Analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa said in a note on the gold price. “A dovish statement could give a lift to price for another attack to the $1,300 level,” he added. Palladium fell about 1.9 percent to $1,361.94 an ounce. Silver was down 0.8 percent to $14.82 per ounce, while platinum prices dropped 0.7 percent to $879.80. (Reporting by K.

Shares of the iPhone maker jumped 5.8% in premarket trading after it said sales in China were steadying and touted how rising demand for its services and accessories helped offset a record drop in iPhone revenue. The company also announced plans for a new $75 billion share buyback and bumped up its cash dividend by 5%. The S&P 500 index clocked another record high close on Tuesday and registered its best four-month rally in nearly nine years. Analysts are now more optimistic on first-quarter earnings growth and expect a 0.7% rise compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. Besides a largely better-than-expected earnings season, recent gains in shares have also been powered by positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Meanwhile, the Fed, which will end its two-day meeting later in the day, is largely expected to keep borrowing costs unchanged and maintain a ‘patient’ monetary policy stance, despite President Donald Trump’s call to cut interest rates.

Among other stocks, Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 5.1% after the chipmaker’s quarterly revenue and profit beat Wall Street estimates as it sold more chips in data centers and servers. Other chip stocks also rose with Nvidia Corp, Qualcomm Inc and Micron Technology Inc up between 1% and 1.6%. CVS Health Corp added 4.5% after the drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting a rise in quarterly profit. Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd gained 1.8% after Massachusetts gaming regulators allowed the casino operator to keep the license for its new casino near Boston with a $35 million fine. Apart from earnings reports, investors will also focus on U.S.-China trade talks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the two countries held “productive” talks in Beijing on Wednesday and will continue discussions in Washington next week.

682,Heathrow expansion clears latest hurdle as High Court rejects legal challenge - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  9:51 AM / in 6 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - The expansion of London’s Heathrow Airport inched closer on Wednesday when a High Court judge rejected legal challenges from environmental campaigners opposed to the building of a third runway. Judge Gary Hickinbottom said he did not accept the arguments made by environmentalists and did not believe the government’s transport minister acted unlawfully when he approved the expansion of Europe’s biggest airport. “The court held that none of the climate change grounds was arguable,” a summary of the judgment said. The campaigners can apply for permission to appeal the rulings.    Britain has spent almost half a century trying to decide whether or where to build a new runway in the densely populated southeast of England. If finally opened, it will be the first full-length runway built in the London area for 70 years. Prime Minister Theresa May’s government has argued that an expansion will show Britain is open for business and able to develop stronger trading ties with Asia after it leaves the European Union - although Brexit has been delayed by a parliamentary deadlock over the terms of departure.  But the expansion plan is still opposed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and a lengthy legal wrangle still lies ahead if the campaigners decide to launch another appeal in the next seven days.  The No. 2 man in the opposition Labour party, finance spokesman John McDonnell, described the court ruling as “bizarre” after he attended the hearing in London.  “This is just the first stage in defeating 3rd runway and protecting our environment,” McDonnell said on Twitter. The airport, which is jointly owned by Spain’s Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority, China Investment Corporation and other investment companies, is in McDonnell’s constituency. The expansion plan, endorsed by parliament last year, is forecast to cost around 14 billion pounds ($18 billion). Under the current plan, the third runway is expected to become operational by 2026.  “We are delighted with today’s ruling which is a further demonstration that the debate on Heathrow expansion has been had and won, not only in parliament, but in the courts also,” a spokesman for Heathrow said. Environmental groups say the expansion will damage the quality of air and increase noise levels. They had argued the plan was inconsistent with pledges made as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.  Tim Crosland, a director of one of the groups that made the legal challenge and an adviser to the Extinction Rebellion group that protested across London last month, said the court judgment was disappointing but it was increasingly difficult to see how the third runway could actually go ahead. “Following the recent Extinction Rebellion protests there is widespread recognition that we are in a state of climate and ecological emergency,” he said.

683,FOREX-Euro builds on recovery as dollar pauses during Fed meet - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:00 AM / in 6 days","3 Min Read* Dollar slips ahead of Fed meeting, euro gains * Kiwi the big mover after jobs data fuel rate cut bets * Sterling rises on Brexit optimism, broad rally * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds details, updates with latest prices) By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - The euro made further gains on Wednesday as dollar bulls paused before the end of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting. Trading was thin with holidays in much of Asia and Europe and most currency pairs traded within tight ranges, although the New Zealand dollar dropped heavily in Asian trading after weak jobs data heightened expectations interest rates would fall. The Fed meeting comes after strong U.S. economic data last month pushed the dollar to a two-year high while hurting the euro, where concerns about a slowdown and underperformance in the region’s economy had been growing. Relatively strong economic growth data in the euro zone on Tuesday, however, prompted some short covering from hedge funds that have been betting against the single currency, lifting the euro above $1.12. The euro added to those gains on Wednesday, rising 0.2 percent to $1.1240, its highest since April 23. The dollar slipped in London trading, with the index down 0.1 percent at 97.354, although not everyone thinks the greenback’s weakness will persist. “The risk for this Fed meeting is that, unless the FOMC meets the market’s dovish expectation for their stance, we would expect another leg higher in USD,” Mizuho strategists said. The day’s big mover was the New Zealand dollar, which fell half a percent after data showed employment unexpectedly fell in the March quarter, although the jobless rate dropped to 4.2 percent. Markets responded by betting a rate cut was more likely. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which holds a policy meeting next week, has already said its next move was likely to be down. The kiwi recovered from earlier lows and was last down 0.2 percent at $0.6662. The Australian dollar gained 0.1 percent to $0.7059 . Accommodative monetary policy throughout much of the world has kept volatility contained across financial markets and demand for riskier assets elevated. “Currencies benefiting from strong global growth combined with low inflation pressures have caught a bid,” Morgan Stanley analysts said, listing the pound and the Indian rupee as both countries are dependent on capital inflows to fund their current account deficits. Sterling extended its rally to hit a new two-week high, supported by growing optimism that the ruling Conservative and opposition Labour parties can break the Brexit deadlock in their negotiations over how to leave the European Union. The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3075, leaving it up 1.7 percent since Monday. The Bank of England holds its policy meeting on Thursday, where it is expected to keep rates unchanged. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.1 percent to 111.31 yen per dollar in quiet trading. Japanese markets are closed for a string of public holidays.

684,Lloyd's of London plans two automated insurance exchanges - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:00 AM / in 6 days","2 Min ReadLONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - Traditional insurance market Lloyd’s of London plans to launch two automated exchanges to make doing business cheaper and quicker, it said on Wednesday. Lloyd’s, which has 99 syndicate members comprising British and international insurers with most of its business carried out face to face, is suffering from two years of steep losses and increased competition from centres such as Bermuda. The Lloyd’s Risk Exchange will automate simple insurance business and a second platform will be used for complex risks, Lloyd’s said in a strategy document entitled “The Future at Lloyd’s”. “We will succeed by harnessing the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit that is at the heart of Lloyd’s,” said John Neal, who became chief executive in October last year. Lloyd’s, which started life in Edward Lloyd’s coffee house in 1688 and is known for insuring everything from ships to paintings, has been trying to modernise. It has moved some of its business onto an electronic platform, but progress has been slow. “The new Lloyd’s will be nimbler and faster,” Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in the preface to the strategy document. Lloyd’s aims to cut the costs of insuring standard risks to 10-20 percent of premiums from 30-40 percent, it said in the document. The market will make it easier for new syndicates to set up business and will also encourage different types of funding, such as private equity and hedge funds, it added. The strategy is the result of meetings with 1,000 market participants. One market source described it as the biggest shake-up at Lloyd’s since the early 1990s, when the market was almost brought to its knees by asbestos-related claims that wiped out many of its individual investors.

685,RPT-WRAPUP 1-Fed likely to ignore Trump's call to cut interest rates - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  11:00 AM / 6 days ago","4 Min Read(Repeats with no changes to text) * Policy statement due at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) * Fed chief Powell to hold press conference * Trump called for radical lowering of rates By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON, May 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve, leaning back against pressure from President Donald Trump to slash interest rates, is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged on Wednesday as it maintains a ‘patient’ monetary policy stance amid strong economic growth. Trump, who has accused the U.S. central bank of undercutting his efforts to boost economic growth, said on Twitter on Tuesday the Fed should cut its key overnight lending rate by a full percentage point and renew the quantitative easing program that saw it pump trillions of dollars into the economy in response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. Fed officials were in the middle of their latest two-day policy meeting when Trump made his comments. The unorthodox advice - more in line with what economists on the far left of the political spectrum might advocate - is likely to go unheeded by a central bank that views its current target interest rate as roughly where it should be to keep the growing U.S. economy on an even keel. The U.S. government reported last week the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.2 percent in the first three months of the year, surprising Fed officials who had expected the data to signal a slowdown. U.S. employers added nearly 200,000 jobs in March, evidence of continued strength in the labor market and a sign as well that the Fed’s four rate hikes in 2018 had not constrained the economy. With no clear reason to cut or raise rates at this point, the focus on Wednesday will be on whether the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee provides any new signal about its likely plans, said Cornerstone Macro analyst Roberto Perli. “There will probably be discussions at this meeting as to what the threshold should be for bringing rates down,” Perli wrote in a note on Tuesday. “But given the diversity of opinions and the lack of a clear need for an imminent decision, it seems unlikely that the (FOMC) will agree to something specific now and be able to send a clear signal.” The Fed raised rates four times last year, lifting its policy rate to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. After its last rate hike in December, the Fed faced particularly sharp criticism from Trump. Some central bank policymakers have cited ongoing weak inflation, still well below the Fed’s 2 percent target, as a sign rates may be too high. The Fed is due to release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). It will not provide new economic or interest rate projections, but Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a press conference shortly after. One technical change officials may make is to trim the amount of interest paid to banks on excess reserves held on deposit at the Fed to 2.35 percent from 2.40 percent . The aim would be to keep the targeted federal funds rate from moving above its current range. The federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, rose to near the upper level of that range this week, as banks competed more aggressively to meet their reserve demands.

686,Democratic presidential candidate Gillibrand releases tax returns in challenge to rivals - Reuters,"March 27, 2019 /  4:21 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s presidential campaign on Wednesday released her tax returns for the years 2007 through 2018, offering the most comprehensive look to date at the finances of a 2020 White House candidate’s finances, as she called on her rivals to do the same. Gillibrand reported about $218,000 in income for the tax year 2018, including $167,634 from her Senate salary and $50,000 from a book deal that was reported as business income, the tax filing shows. Gillibrand’s husband, who in previous years had worked as a financial consultant, reported no income in 2018. The New York senator paid $29,170 in federal taxes - an effective tax rate of 13.6 percent - and an additional $12,523 in state taxes, according to the 2018 return. “I want voters to know that I’m beholden to no one, that my values are not for sale and that I’m working only for you,” Gillibrand said in a video released by her campaign. “Join me in calling on every presidential candidate to disclose their taxes, this is what transparency and accountability is all about.” Gillibrand’s release of tax filings is a contrast with President Donald Trump, who was the first modern U.S. president not to release his tax returns to the public. Gillibrand, who formally joined the presidential race on March 17, gave a fiery speech on Sunday in which she called Trump a “coward” who “is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country.”  The release of her tax documents indicates Gillibrand, 52, likely will make transparency a theme of her campaign. She is trying to build momentum among a group of more than 15 announced and potential candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, including five other senators and former Vice President Joe Biden, who is expected to join the race soon. Gillibrand, along with other candidates such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, is trying to position herself as a progressive in race, with many making anti-corruption efforts and getting big money out of politics central to their campaigns. Warren previously released her tax returns for 2007 through 2017 but not her 2018 filing, which is not due to the Internal Revenue Service until April 15. Sanders, who released one annual tax filing during his 2016 presidential primary campaign, said last month that he will soon release more filings but they “will bore you to death.” After taking control of the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Democrats passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns. It has not been voted on by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans. Reporting By Amanda Becker; Editing by Bill TrottAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

687,Democratic White House contender Warren targets corporate agriculture - Reuters,"March 27, 2019 /  4:13 PM / in a month","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren took aim on Wednesday at agricultural conglomerates, promising her administration would break up big agribusiness mergers that she said have hurt family farmers. Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and a fierce Wall Street critic, released a broad plan that she said would make it easier for small farmers to survive in the face of growing corporate consolidation in the rural economy. She singled out several big agriculture corporations, naming Tyson Food Inc, Bayer-Monsanto and Dow-DuPont, and said the Bayer-Monsanto merger should not have been approved. Under her plan, regulators would review “anti-competitive” agricultural mergers and break up integrated businesses that control many different levels of the farming chain and markets. “We can make better policy choices  —  and we can begin by leveling the playing field for America’s family farmers,” Warren wrote in a Medium blog post outlining her proposal. Warren released the plan ahead of a campaign trip to Iowa, a farm state that kicks off the Democratic presidential nominating contest in February 2020. During her visit, she will participate in a Democratic policy forum on rural issues as the party searches for ways to reverse Republican President Donald Trump’s crushing win over Democrat Hillary Clinton in rural areas in 2016. Earlier this month, Warren also proposed breaking up big tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc to promote competition in the technology sector. She has made her populist economic message the heart of her campaign in a growing Democratic field of contenders, arguing the economy is rigged for corporations and the wealthy. “Bad decisions in Washington have consistently favored the interests of multinational corporations and big business lobbyists over the interests of family farmers,” Warren said in her agricultural proposal. “Mergers mean that farmers have fewer and fewer choices for buying and selling, while vertical integration has meant that big agribusinesses face less competition throughout the chain and thus capture more and more of the profits,” she said. Warren’s plan also would end “contract farming” by conglomerates, create a national right-to-repair law that allows farmers to repair their own equipment or take it to a mechanic of their choice instead of an authorized agent, and establish country-of-origin rules to require beef and pork producers to label where their livestock was raised and slaughtered.

688,The Mueller interview that wasn't: how Trump's legal strategy paid off - Reuters,"March 26, 2019 /  11:55 PM / a month ago","10 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Attorney General William Barr sent lawmakers a summary of the key findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, members of President Donald Trump’s legal team were gathered in an office near the U.S. Capitol. They soon had reason to celebrate on Sunday, perhaps helped by a pivotal strategic decision. Mueller had spent 22 months investigating whether Trump or his aides conspired with Russia during the 2016 election, interviewing 500 witnesses. The Republican president’s lawyers made sure he was not among them. The strategy paid off, insulating Trump from the legal jeopardy presented by a sit-down interview with the special counsel’s team - an interview that Trump had said publicly he wanted to do. There was even a tentative date for the interview - Jan. 27, 2018 - though one of Trump’s lawyers told Reuters he never intended to make the president available to Mueller. And Mueller never issued a subpoena demanding testimony. On Sunday, Trump’s lead attorneys - Jay Sekulow, Rudy Giuliani and husband-and-wife team Jane and Martin Raskin - were huddled at a conference table with their computers open, awaiting Barr’s summary. When it finally popped up online, they were jubilant. Mueller had found no evidence of conspiracy with Russia, Barr said. The attorney general also concluded there was insufficient evidence that Trump had committed obstruction of justice by trying to impede the inquiry - an issue the special counsel had left unresolved. The findings provided Trump a big political victory after an investigation that had cast a long shadow over his presidency. Giuliani threw his arm around Sekulow, as Sekulow told Reuters on Tuesday. Sekulow said he told the others, “This is absolutely fantastic.” Giuliani told Reuters minutes after Barr issued the findings: “It’s better than I expected.” Trump’s legal team successfully rebuffed Mueller’s repeated efforts to get a sit-down interview with Trump and avoided the president being subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. They agreed instead to have Trump provide written responses, which he did in November. The stakes were high. Some of the lawyers had worried that if Trump had submitted to the interview, it could expose him to claims that he lied to the FBI, or made “false statements,” in legal terms. Giuliani publicly called an interview a “perjury trap,” especially if Mueller went beyond asking Trump about collusion and strayed into other matters. Trump is frequently called out for misstating facts or simply making things up. For the past year, Trump’s lawyers pursued a two-pronged approach that relied on public attacks by Giuliani on Mueller’s “witch hunt” on cable TV news alongside backroom negotiations with Mueller’s team led by the Raskins, according to two sources familiar with the strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment for this story. When Mueller began his work in May 2017, Trump’s legal team initially decided that cooperation was the quickest way to end the probe, according to Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer who handled the inquiry for the presidency at the time. More than 20 White House staff members were made available for special counsel interviews, and the administration handed over more than 20,000 documents. A burning question was whether Trump himself would agree to be interviewed. Despite the tentative date being set, Trump’s legal advisers were split. Attorney John Dowd, who at the time represented Trump personally in the inquiry, worried that an interview would be too risky.  “We’re not going to go in there and make a mistake,” said  Dowd, a pugnacious ex-Marine, recalling how he pushed back against Trump being interviewed even though the president had expressed willingness.  Dowd said he talked to Mueller’s team “about what they had done to Flynn and Papadopoulos.” Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and a former Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, both ended up pleading guilty to lying to the FBI after submitting to special counsel interviews. “We weren’t going there,” Dowd said in an interview. Dowd said Mueller told him he wanted to discuss 16 areas in the interview, a scope viewed as too expansive. In agreeing to the tentative interview date, Trump’s lawyers had been seeking to draw out Mueller to find out what he already knew, Dowd said.   “We wanted to know what was really on their mind. They played it close to the vest. Our purpose was: the more meetings we had, the more we learned. That was the purpose of keeping the talking going,” Dowd said, adding that he never intended to make Trump available for an interview. After the interview was canceled, it was apparent, according to Cobb, that the process would drag on. “Once there was a decision by the president’s lawyers in January 2018 not to proceed with an interview at that time - but to keep the possibility open - it was clear this would take some time,” Cobb said. The lawyers also faced the daily prospect of a subpoena from Mueller to force Trump to testify. If it came, their plan was to ask a judge to quash the subpoena, expecting the legal fight to reach the Supreme Court. It never came. “We were prepared from the outset in the event of a subpoena to challenge it,” Sekulow said. “We felt confident the law was clearly on our side.” Although not all experts agree, the legal team’s view was that a president cannot be compelled to testify unless the information could not be obtained from other sources and the circumstances were extraordinary.  By the spring of 2018, it appeared Trump had two options: either sit for an interview or be subpoenaed. By that point, Trump’s team had been reshuffled. Dowd resigned in March. The Raskins and Giuliani came on board in April. Cobb was replaced in the White House by Emmet Flood in May. Sekulow was the only key member remaining throughout. The new legal team pressed Mueller to show them that the investigation had reached a stage that would justify sitting down with the president, a source familiar with the negotiations said. “Are you in a position where you have evidence of a crime?” the source said the team asked Mueller.  The Trump legal team argued that because the special counsel had amassed a wealth of information through interviews with White House staffers and others close to the president, Mueller had not reached the high bar necessary for a sit-down interview with Trump. “By providing all the witnesses from the White House and the documentation from the White House and the presidential election committee, my view from the outset was the predicate had not been reached to demand an interview with the president,” Sekulow said. “I never thought we should modify from that.” The team stuck to that position through the autumn of 2018 while negotiating the deal in which Trump would answer written questions only on a limited subject - potential collusion with Russia before the 2016 election - not open-ended queries that potentially could have spilled into his businesses, finances or other matters. Mueller’s agreement to submit a list of questions was a critical moment. The special counsel never stopped asking for the interview, the source said, but when Mueller acquiesced to  answers in writing, it was a game-changer. “It went from being constantly, ‘Are they going to decide to issue a subpoena?’ to, ‘We’re doing some written questions,’” the source said. Trump’s lawyers would not entertain questions on the issue of whether Trump had tried to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI director James Comey, then overseeing the Russia probe, and frequently assailed Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly for not ending the inquiry. The legal team did not think a president could be found guilty of obstruction of justice for firing someone whom he had appointed in the first place to work for the administration. “That was off the table,” and negotiations with Mueller continued on answering questions on Russia’s interference in the election, the source familiar with the matter said. “At the end of the day, the strategy worked. No interview. No grand jury subpoena,” the source added. Trump signed his answers to Mueller on Nov. 20 before leaving Washington to celebrate the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “We answered every question they asked that was legitimately pre-election and focused on Russia,” Giuliani told Reuters at the time. “Nothing post-election.” Mueller’s team had pressed during the negotiations for an opportunity to pose follow-up questions to Trump, possibly in person, Giuliani said. But ultimately the special counsel agreed to accept just the written answers with no conditions and no follow-ups, Giuliani added.  By the end of last year, Trump’s lawyers had little interaction with Mueller’s team. Asked about the team’s strategy, Sekulow said, “I guess it worked.

690,McConnell backs push for investigation of Russia probe missteps - Reuters,"March 26, 2019 /  7:04 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican in the U.S. Senate said on Tuesday he supported a push by a Republican colleague for an inquiry into potential law enforcement missteps in a probe of possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. “I think Senator (Lindsey) Graham has raised a legitimate question,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. “I think it’s not inappropriate for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, with jurisdiction over the Justice Department, to investigate possible misbehaviors.” Graham, who heads the panel, said on Monday he wanted to see a special counsel appointed to look into the origins of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for former Trump adviser Carter Page. The warrant was based in part on information in a dossier on Trump compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who co-founded a private intelligence firm. Graham said he would use the panel’s subpoena power if necessary, whether or not a special counsel is appointed, to look into the matter. Graham’s call for an investigation came one day after Attorney General William Barr said a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller found that Trump’s campaign did not conspire with Moscow.

691,Barr plans to issue Mueller report details within weeks - Reuters,"March 26, 2019 /  7:24 PM / a month ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr plans to issue in a matter of weeks a public version of the special counsel’s report that found President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign team did not conspire with Russia, as Trump prepared to use the findings against his political opponents. Democrats attempted to change the subject to healthcare after the report from Robert Mueller appeared to shatter their case that Trump was an illegitimately elected president. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 48 percent of Americans still believed Trump worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, down 6 points since conclusions from the Mueller report came out on Sunday. The poll found Trump’s job approval rating had ticked up 4 points to 43 percent following release of the findings. There was a thirst for more information, as 57 percent of Americans said they wanted to see the entire report. Barr released his own summary of the report’s central findings on Sunday but said he needed more time to review the report to determine how much of it could be made public. A Justice Department official said on Tuesday that Barr’s plan was to release a public version in “weeks, not months.” Congressional Democrats have demanded Barr turn over the report to them by April 2, which would only leave a week for the Justice Department to complete its review. The Justice official said there was no plan to share an advance copy of the report with the White House. Some portions of Mueller’s confidential report contain materials that arose during secret grand jury proceedings. Federal rules generally prohibit the government from releasing that information to the public. The report also contains information about ongoing criminal investigations that Mueller referred to other U.S. attorneys’ offices. Barr has not yet revealed a precise date for when the final public version might be ready. The Justice Department has not commented on the Democrats’ request that it be released to Congress by next week. Trump and his top aides attacked unidentified political opponents for starting the campaign investigation, calling the actions treasonous and worth probing. “I think what happened was a disgrace,” Trump told reporters on a visit to the U.S. Capitol, where he had lunch with Republican senators. Republicans also were out for retribution, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying he supported a push for an inquiry into potential missteps by law enforcement officials in their probe of Trump. Senator Chuck Schumer, leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, leaped on a court filing from the Justice Department that said the entire Obamacare healthcare law - the signature legislative accomplishment of Democratic President Barack Obama - should be struck down in the courts. The law provides healthcare coverage for an estimated 20 million people, and Trump and his Republican allies, who see it as government overreach, have failed to replace it despite vows to do so. “It is a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties: Democrats are fighting to expand and improve healthcare coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. Republicans said during their lunch with Trump they discussed ways to improve the healthcare system. Trump’s re-election campaign launched fundraising drives in the aftermath of the Mueller report. “Democrats allowed this WITCH HUNT to go on for 2 YEARS. It’s time to show them we’re tired of their PARTISAN investigations,” said one fundraising appeal. Trump suggested he had been the victim of a smear campaign launched by senior officials in the Obama administration. “It went very high up, and it started fairly low, but with instructions from the high-up,” Trump told reporters, without offering details. “This should never happen to a president again.” Trump advisers were predicting he would go on the offensive at a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Thursday night, his first major appearance since the Mueller investigation concluded. “We reserve the right to remind the American people that the Democrats have tried for two years, by lying to the American people, to overturn the election results of 2016,” a senior Trump campaign official said. “And they don’t get to just turn the page and say: ‘Never mind.” Reporting by Sarah N.

693,Puerto Rico board files flurry of lawsuits ahead of claim deadline - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  10:53 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadSAN JUAN, April 30 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board on Tuesday began filing the first round of scores of lawsuits seeking to recover money the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth paid to bondholders, businesses and others. The board has until the end of this week to file certain claims after the U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases declined to extend an expiring two-year statute of limitations. More than 230 complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico targeting about $4.2 billion in payments made by the island’s government, according to the board. Defendants include pharmaceutical maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Puerto Rico Inc, as well as individuals and local companies that provide educational, health, IT, security, construction and communication services. “The oversight board has a responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico to recover any payments in contravention of bankruptcy or Puerto Rico law made prior to the commonwealth’s bankruptcy,” board executive director Natalie Jaresko said in a statement. The legal actions cover a period dating back as far as four years before Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy on May 3, 2017, in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Legal arguments for the claims include that these payments “deviate from historical payment patterns,” were made “in the absence of a contract,” or do not correspond to existing contracts. Claims would be dismissed against defendants who can show “a proper basis for the payments.” There was no immediate comment from Bristol-Myers. The board contends that Puerto Rico was insolvent at the time these payments were made. The parties being sued “knew or should have known that the commonwealth was insolvent, in the vicinity of insolvency, or unable to satisfy its obligations as they became due,” the fiscal panel argues. A deluge of lawsuits is also expected this week against owners of general obligation bonds the island issued in 2012 and 2014. The board wants to recoup payments made to bondholders if the court grants its motion to invalidate the bonds because they were issued in violation of a debt limit in Puerto Rico’s constitution. On Monday, the board informed the court it is targeting investors who owned $2.5 million or more of the bonds any time between May 3, 2013, and May 21, 2017. Claims would also be pursued against 27 bond underwriters, nine law firms, and five accounting firms, according to an attorney for the oversight board.

694,S&P 500 posts best four-month run in nearly nine years; Apple jumps after hours - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:49 AM / 7 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 eked out another record high close on Tuesday and capped its best four-month stretch in nearly nine years after a recent rally that helped to restore investors’ belief in the decade-long bull run. Apple shares jumped about 5 percent following its quarterly results after the bell, which will help to ease worries about the earnings outlook for the S&P 500, even as Google-parent Alphabet tumbled during the session in the wake of a revenue miss.  S&P 500 e-mini futures were last up 0.2% and jumped following the report from Apple, which forecast stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook also said iPhone sales had begun to stabilize in China. Besides a mostly better-than-expected earnings season, analysts said market-positive economic data, a dovish Federal Reserve and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks have all helped drive recent gains. “All in all, things for the market are looking pretty decent: a friendly Fed, low rates, growing earnings. It doesn’t get much better than that,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. With more than half of the S&P 500 companies reporting, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to have risen slightly from a year ago, a stark reversal from the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. But not all results have been upbeat. During the regular session, Alphabet shares fell 7.5% in their worst decline since October 2012 after the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years.

695,Japan's SoftBank invests $1 billion in delivery app Rappi - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:53 AM / in 7 days","2 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank will invest $1 billion in Colombian delivery app Rappi, marking the first move by its newly created Innovation Fund for Latin America, according to a statement on Tuesday, confirming earlier media reports. In a statement, Rappi said the proceeds will be used to enhance the company’s presence in existing markets and to enter new ones. New products and services are also likely to be created, Rappi said, without providing further details. At first, SoftBank Group Corp and another SoftBank global investment vehicle, Vision Fund, will split the investment evenly. In a second move the Latin America-focused fund is expected to be offered SoftBank Group’s investment. Rappi did not disclose the stake SoftBank will hold. In March, SoftBank launched a $5 billion fund to invest in tech firms in Latin America. “In less than four years Rappi has become one of the fastest growing start-ups in Latin America. This rapid growth demonstrates the immense opportunity in the Latin American region,” Marcelo Claure, SoftBank Group’s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive of SoftBank Group International and CEO of the Innovation Fund said in the statement. SoftBank will appoint Jeffrey Housenbold, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, to Rappi’s board of directors, according to the agreement. Rappi’s investors already included DST Global, Delivery Hero, Sequoia Capital, Andreesen Horowitz and Y Combinator. It was valued at $1 billion in its latest funding round in September, backed by DST Global. Founded in 2015, Rappi operates in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, besides Brazil. SoftBank also announced on Tuesday it will invest in early-stage companies jointly with Colombia’s government.

696,Trump's Fed pick Moore faces mounting lawmaker doubts - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  9:51 PM / in 7 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Doubts mounted on Tuesday over U.S. President Donald Trump’s pick to fill a vacant seat at the Federal Reserve, with one Republican senator saying she was “very unlikely” to back economic commentator Stephen Moore and another calling his nomination “very problematic.” The remarks, from U.S. Republican Senators Joni Ernst and Lindsey Graham, respectively, signaled growing resistance to Trump’s bid to put a loyalist on the Fed’s policy-setting panel after remarks denigrating women, made over nearly two decades of writing and commentating, were widely reported last week.  Moore did not immediately reply to a voicemail and email from Reuters requesting comment. He has apologized in recent days for some of his past remarks about women, explaining that some were attempts at humor.  Trump, who on Tuesday reiterated his call for a Fed interest rate cut, announced he would pick Moore for the Fed post just over a month ago, but has not formally nominated him.  “Very unlikely that I would support that person,” Ernst, who represents Iowa, told reporters on Tuesday, adding that she had spoken to the White House about her position. If a vote took place in the Senate today, “I don’t think” he would be confirmed, she said, according to CNN.  “It will be a very problematic nomination,” said Graham, a close ally of Trump. Asked if he would oppose Moore if nominated, Graham said he would study the pick.  Republican Senator Richard Shelby on Monday expressed concern about the “drip by drip” of negative news stories about Moore. Shelby is on the Fed’s banking committee, the first stop in any confirmation process for a Fed seat.  Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate, and given that Democrats are expected to oppose Moore’s nomination, he can only lose the support of three Republican senators and still be confirmed.  Among his writings that have drawn scrutiny is a 2014 column in the National Review in which he worried about male wages and suggested a society in which women earn more than men could be “disruptive to family stability.” Earlier Tuesday on CNBC he reiterated his concern over trends in male earnings, not women’s pay.  Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia “has not made a decision on whether or not she would support Stephen Moore’s confirmation if he were nominated for the Federal Reserve board, but she has said she has questions about some of his previous statements,” a spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday.  Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson “will reserve judgment until he’s had the opportunity to meet” with Moore once nominated, according to his spokeswoman.  Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of four Senators who opposed Trump’s other pick for the Fed, Herman Cain, before Cain withdrew, told reporters Tuesday she planned to talk to the White House directly about Moore but would not tell reporters what she thought and repeatedly declined to say if she thought he should withdraw. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the White House should immediately withdraw Moore from consideration for the seat.     “I think neither his politics nor his views of women are very funny. The White House ought to immediately withdraw his nomination. He didn’t belong on the Fed even before these writings came out disrespecting women, all the more reason that the nomination should be withdrawn,” Schumer told reporters. The White House still backs Moore for a seat on the Fed, Trump’s top economic adviser said on Monday. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday the White House was reviewing Moore’s past comments.

697,"Devon Energy raises U.S. oil output forecast, beats profit estimates - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  8:45 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Devon Energy Corp on Tuesday raised its full-year U.S. oil production forecast and beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit, supported by higher output from its operations in the Delaware basin. The company said net production in the Delaware basin surged 76 percent in the first quarter to 107,000 oil-equivalent barrels (boe) per day. The Delaware basin of the oil-rich Permian shale field is among the largest in the region. The increase in production from the company’s shale assets also prompted it to raise its 2019 U.S. oil output forecast. The company now expects 2019 light-oil production growth to reach 17 percent, a 200 basis point improvement from its previous guidance. The volume of crude being pumped out of Texas has pushed the United States over the last decade to become the world’s biggest oil producer last year. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates U.S. crude oil production to rise by 1.43 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 to average 12.39 million bpd, up from its previous forecast for a rise of 1.35 million bpd. Devon’s profit beat comes as the Oklahoma-based company authorized the sale of its assets in Canada and in the gas-rich Barnett shale patch in the United States, to turn Devon into a pure-play oil producer. Devon is also among several oil producers to invest in the SCOOP and STACK regions, a fast-growing shale oil play in the Anadarko basin that has attracted investment from crude producers expanding beyond the Permian. However, the company has maintained its capital spending target of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for 2019. Net loss attributable to Devon widened to $317 million, or 74 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $197 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier, primarily due to a $670 million non-cash charge related to the company’s hedge positions.  Excluding items, the company earned 36 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 28 cents. On Tuesday, shale oil and gas producer Concho Resources Inc also increased full-year 2019 total production growth outlook in the range of 23 percent to 27 percent, and said it expects 2019 oil production growth of between 27 percent and 31 percent.

699,"GE cautious as profit rises, cash burn slows; shares, bonds rise - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:44 AM / 7 days ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Tuesday it generated more profit and lost less cash than expected in the first quarter, suggesting an improving outlook under its new leader that sent its shares and bonds higher. New Chief Executive Larry Culp cautioned, however, that the results stemmed largely from the timing of payments to suppliers and from customers, and did not alter GE’s financial outlook for the year. “One quarter is a data point not a trend,” Culp said on a conference call with analysts.  GE’s profit from continuing operations more than tripled as sales rose in GE’s aviation, oil and gas, and healthcare units. At the same time, negative cash flow from industrial business was $1.2 billion, much less than the $2.16 billion outflow that analysts, on average, were expecting. Culp had set low earnings targets in March and warned that GE’s industrial cash flow could be negative by as much as $2 billion. GE’s shares rose 4.5% to close at $10.17, after the call. They had risen more than 10% before the market opened. GE bonds also rallied, extending a recovery in more than $100 billion of GE debt. Yields on dozens of longer-dated issues were at their lowest since Nov. 1. A $1 billion GE Capital bond with a 4% coupon due in July 2035 was up more than 1.5 cents at nearly 87 cents and a yield of 5.2%, compared with a low of 63 cents on the dollar last November to yield more than 8%. Investors have been keen for a turnaround since GE named Culp last October to restore earnings and improve a stock price that has fallen by more than two-thirds since 2016.  GE took a string of multibillion-dollar writedowns last year, so the slowing in cash outflows in the latest quarter raised hopes that its fortunes have started to improve.  GE’s industrial free cash flow showed a “much smaller outflow than we expected,” said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at Barclays, and “should drive a positive reaction in the stock.” But while the Boston-based conglomerate stuck to its full-year financial forecast, it noted “new risk” from Boeing Co’s 737 MAX jet, for which GE engines with partner Safran SA of France. The plane model was grounded worldwide last month after a second fatal accident in less than five months.    Profit margins also contracted at GE’s aviation, power and renewable energy businesses, the three core units that GE plans to retain as it undergoes a break-up announced last year.  A 1.6 percentage point drop in GE’s industrial margins in the quarter is a “stark reminder of the challenges that the company still faces,” said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody’s. He added that he expects margins to be flat or slightly improved by year-end. GE’s cash balance was boosted mainly the $2.9 billion sale of locomotive business to Wabtec Corp. Culp has said the 2019 “reset” of GE would result in negative cash flow at its most-troubled business, power, through 2020 before turning positive in 2021. GE wrote down $22 billion in goodwill at the unit last year. In the latest quarter, power orders fell 14% and profit fell 71% to $80 million on revenue of $5.7 billion, down about 22% from a year earlier, GE said. Some saw signs that the power unit’s prospects will improve. “This was a business that everyone gave up as dead ... but (it) is more than able to fend for itself,” William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann told Reuters. Earnings from continuing operations attributable to GE shareholders rose to $954 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $261 million a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, GE earned 14 cents per share. Analysts had expected 9 cents per share, on average.  Total revenue fell 2% to $27.29 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $27.05 billion.

700,Mallinckrodt shares drop after U.S. joins cases over expensive drug - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:48 PM / in 7 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has joined a pair of whistleblower lawsuits alleging a drugmaker now owned by Mallinckrodt Plc improperly promoted an expensive multiple sclerosis treatment and paid kickbacks to doctors who prescribed the drug. News of the department’s decision to intervene in the lawsuits after conducting an investigation into the whistleblowers’ allegations sent the stock price of Mallinckrodt Plc down nearly 14 percent on Tuesday. The lawsuits, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, claimed Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which Mallinckrodt acquired in 2014, defrauded government healthcare programs by illegally marketing H.P. Acthar Gel. The drug is used to treat infantile spasms and multiple sclerosis. In 2007, Questcor hiked Acthar’s price for a single a vial from about $2,000 to $23,000, one of the lawsuits said. Mallinckrodt said the drug’s price today is $38,892. Last year, Acthar represented 35 percent of Mallinckrodt’s $3.2 billion in net sales. CNN first reported on the case on Tuesday. Mallinckrodt in a statement said it disagrees with the allegations and has been in  “advanced settlement talks with the government over the past several months.” Mallinckrodt’s shares were trading at $15.77, down 13.97 percent, at midday on Tuesday. The lawsuits were filed in 2012 and 2013 by former Questcor employees Charles Strunck and Scott Clark under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government’s behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims. The lawsuits are filed under seal so the government can investigate their claims. The Justice Department following an investigation may intervene in the cases, which is typically a major boost for them.  In his complaint, Strunck alleged Questcor in an effort to boost sales paid doctors illegal kickbacks in the form of bribes, speaker fees and consulting deals in exchange for promoting and prescribing Acthar. His lawsuit also alleged that Questcor’s sales staff used deceptive and misleading marketing tactics to promote Acthar for uses and treatment regimens not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Justice Department in court filings in both lawsuits made public on March 11 said it was intervening in the cases and planned to file its own complaint within 90 days. The lawsuits were then unsealed. Mallinckrodt in January 2017 agreed to pay $100 million to resolve claims that Questcor violated antitrust laws by sharply increasing the price of Acthar while ensuring that no rival medicine appeared on the market.

702,"Voce says Argo ROE could double with cost cuts, nominates five directors - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  9:00 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadBEVERLY HILLS, Calif., April 30 (Reuters) - An activist hedge fund said on Tuesday that insurance company Argo Group International Holdings Ltd could double its return on equity if it cut $100 million in costs, including millions spent on corporate jets and housing for its chief executive. Voce Capital Management LLC is asking Argo shareholders to install five new directors at the company’s annual meeting next month, saying the current board is responsible for a “culture of indulgence.” Voce outlined its case in a securities filing, seen by Reuters, which is plans to file later on Tuesday. Argo said it could not comment on any of the matters until it sees the filing. Voce said that by eliminating $100 million in costs, including some $20 million that includes payments for corporate jets, sponsorship, CEO pay and housing, including a waterfront villa in Bermuda and a penthouse apartment in New York City, Argo’s return on equity could climb by 4.6 percent. That would handily lift its 10-year average return on equity of 5.7 percent to double digits, Voce said. The $250 million hedge fund, run by J. Daniel Plants, owns 5.6 percent of $2.4 billion Argo, which specializes in insurance and reinsurance products in property and casualty insurance. Voce announced plans to push for changes in February. Now the hedge fund is ratcheting up pressure by naming five directors and laying out a 131-page plan on where to make changes. Voce’s director candidates have global insurance and capital allocation expertise plus public company board experience. Voce proposes to replace five directors, including ones not up for re-election now, and called the current board weak. Voce wants a combination of expense cuts, improved capital allocation and portfolio realignment, including possibly spinning off certain businesses. Investors would reward such moves, Voce said, forecasting shares could climb as high as $126, compared with Tuesday’s closing price of $78.07. If nothing is done, the hedge fund said, the stock price could also drop, erasing gains made since Voce began pressuring Argo. Voce also said the company’s Gulfstream 5 jet logged 584 flights in the last three calendar years to places where Argo CEO Mark E. Watson III has homes.

703,"Democrats push for Mueller report to Congress by next week, Republicans resist - Reuters","March 25, 2019 /  1:41 PM / a month ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A fight brewed between Democrats and Republicans over the public release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, while President Donald Trump kept up attacks on his critics on Monday. As the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Republican chairman called for an investigation into the origins of the probe of any Trump campaign links with Russians, the Senate leader blocked a second attempt by Democrats to pass a measure aimed at pushing the Justice Department into full disclosure of the report. Six committee chairs in the Democratic-led House of Representatives called on U.S. Attorney General William Barr, in a letter seen by Reuters, to release the full Mueller report to Congress by April 2. Earlier this month, the House voted 420-0 in favor of making the report public, with no Republican opposition. Barr on Sunday released a four-page summary of conclusions of the investigation that detailed Russian interference but cleared the Republican president’s campaign team of conspiring with Moscow. No one outside the Justice Department has yet seen the report, including the White House. The Justice Department has not said whether it will release Mueller’s full report, but Barr has said he will be as transparent as possible. A person familiar with the matter said there were no plans at this time to show the Mueller report to the White House.     Trump on Monday vented his anger at the inquiry and vowed investigations into unnamed political enemies who did “evil” and “treasonous things.” The probe left unresolved the question of whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice.  Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and a Trump ally, told reporters he would ask for an investigation. Barr told Graham in a telephone call that he would be willing to testify to the panel about the Mueller probe, according to a spokesman for the senator. Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, noting that it took nearly two years for Mueller to conduct his investigation, said after blocking the Democratic measure: “It’s not unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department just a little time to complete their review in a professional and responsible manner.” Trump said on Monday that “it wouldn’t bother me at all” if the report were released but that it was up to Barr. The end of the Mueller inquiry did not spell the end of the investigative pressure on Trump by Democrats, who gave no indication of easing up on their multiple congressional investigations into his business and personal dealings. Democratic lawmakers were likely to face a protracted legal battle that will turn on Trump’s right to keep communications with his advisers private, legal and political experts said. One of Trump’s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said at least part of the report should be withheld.  Sekulow said it “would be very inappropriate” to release the president’s written answers to questions posed by the special counsel, calling the responses provided in November confidential. After lengthy negotiations, Trump reversed his previous stance that he would be willing to submit to an in-person interview with the Mueller team, ultimately agreeing only to provide written answers. The president and his allies in Congress went on the offensive as the summary gave him a political victory ahead of his 2020 re-election bid, with no allegations of criminal wrongdoing brought against him. “There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things, I would say treasonous things against our country,” Trump told reporters at the White House, without mentioning anyone by name or citing specific actions. Trump pledged new investigations but did not specify who would conduct them or who should be targeted. Trump in the past has called for investigations of Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated in 2016. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called for congressional hearings to investigate prominent Trump critics including former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey and other FBI figures. In an appearance on NBC’s “Today” program, Sanders said: “The media and Democrats have called the president an agent of a foreign government. That is an action equal to treason, which is punishable by death in this country.” Asked if Trump owed Mueller an apology, Sanders added: “I think Democrats and the liberal media owe the president and they owe the American people an apology.” Trump had repeatedly accused Mueller, a former FBI director, of running a “witch hunt” with a team of “thugs” and having conflicts of interest. But asked on Monday if Mueller had acted honorably, Trump said: “Yes.” Mueller, who submitted his confidential report on his findings to Barr on Friday, neither accused Trump of obstruction of justice in trying to impede the investigation nor exonerated him of obstruction, according to the summary. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, concluded the investigation’s evidence “is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.” The Mueller investigation had cast a cloud over Trump’s presidency but he has declared himself fully exonerated, despite what Barr’s summary said on the obstruction of justice issue. On March 5, Mueller visited the Department of Justice’s main office in Washington to meet with Barr and Rosenstein and told them he would not be reaching a conclusion with respect to obstruction, a decision that was unexpected, a department official said. The Kremlin said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin was ready to improve ties with the United States following the release of Barr’s summary and called on Washington to formally recognize there was no collusion. Russia repeated its denial of U.S. intelligence agencies’ findings that it meddled in the election. Mueller, in previous legal filings, described a Russian campaign to interfere in the election through hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, harm Clinton and boost Trump. Mueller charged 12 Russian intelligence officers, 13 other Russians accused of taking part in a disinformation campaign and three Russian companies.

704,Can Trump block Twitter users whose views he dislikes? U.S. Appeals Court skeptical - Reuters,"March 26, 2019 /  6:37 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday cast doubt on U.S. President Donald Trump’s ability to keep Twitter users whose political views he dislikes from responding to his own account, suggesting it might violate those users’ free speech rights. Trump has made his @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account an integral and controversial part of his presidency, using it to promote his agenda, announce policy and attack critics. He had blocked many critics from his account, which prevents them from directly responding to his tweets. U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald ruled last May that this violated the users’ First Amendment rights, prompting Trump to unblock at least some of these accounts. The decision came in a lawsuit brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and several Twitter users. A lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice, arguing for the president on Tuesday, urged three judges of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan to overturn Buchwald’s decision. While Trump does use his Twitter account for government business, it was not a public forum, the attorney, Jennifer Utrecht, told the judges. When Judge Barrington Parker asked why blocking users for their political views did not violate the First Amendment, Utrecht said blocking was akin to Trump walking away from a person trying to talk to him on the street. The judges had fewer questions for Jameel Jaffer, the lawyer for the plaintiffs.  Jaffer said that although Twitter is a private platform, Trump was effectively inviting the public to participate in an open forum by using it for government purposes. “The whole point of Twitter is to facilitate interactions between users,” Jaffer said. The individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit include Philip Cohen, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland; Holly Figueroa, described in the complaint as a political organizer and songwriter in Washington state, and Brandon Neely, a Texas police officer. It is not known when the court will issue a ruling on the case. Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Lisa ShumakerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

April exports fell 2.0 percent from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday. That was less than the 5 percent decline forecast in a Reuters poll and March’s 8.2 percent drop. Policymakers worry that the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing could cause collateral damage for South Korea, especially as Asia’s fourth largest economy suffered an unexpected contraction in the first quarter on slumping exports and investment.  Gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from October-December, the worst contraction since a 3.3 percent drop in late 2008. The trade ministry said slowing Chinese growth and weaker global demand for Korea’s memory chips resulted in further declines in exports in April. It also said April exports would have expanded 0.8 percent from a year earlier if not for the 13.5 percent drop in memory chips.  “The huge price drop in memory chips, adjustment of inventories at global IT companies, as well as stalled consumer demand for new smartphones in China” have slowed semiconductor exports in April, the ministry said. Shipments to China, South Korea’s biggest trading partner, fell 4.5 percent, making a sixth consecutive monthly fall. However, U.S.-bound exports rose for a seventh consecutive month, helped by a boost in demand for Korean cars and mobile phones.  “Exports are likely to recover in the coming months as demand from China recovers. The chip sector will also likely see a rebound in demand,” said Chun Kyu-yeon, an economist at Hana Financial Investment. Imports increased 2.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with the poll prediction of 0.3 percent. This led to a preliminary trade surplus of $4.12 billion, down from $5.2 billion in March.

707,Allergan to prevail in vote over CEO Saunders' chairman role-sources - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:18 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Allergan Plc is on course to defeat a non-binding shareholder resolution tabled by David Tepper’s hedge fund Appaloosa LP that would have instructed the drugmaker’s CEO Brent Saunders to immediately give up his role as chairman, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. A loss would have been bruising for Saunders, a prolific dealmaker who has served as CEO of Allergan since 2014. Allergan has committed to separating the CEO and chairman roles no later than the next leadership change when Saunders, 49, steps down, rather than immediately. He has not set any public timetable for his exit. Enough votes have been cast for Allergan to prevail against Appaloosa, the sources said. However, Appaloosa’s resolution is expected to attract the votes of a substantial minority of Allergan’s shareholders, the sources added, highlighting the displeasure of many investors focused on stricter corporate governance standards. The sources asked not to be identified because the outcome of the shareholder vote is not yet public. Allergan declined to comment, and Appaloosa could not be reached for comment. Saunders has held the roles of CEO and chairman since October 2016. Before then Saunders served as CEO of the company alongside Paul Bisaro, who was executive chairman. He left to become CEO of Impax Laboratories Inc.  Two leading shareholder advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services LP and Glass Lewis & Co, earlier this month threw their support behind Allergan’s management by recommending that investors vote against Appaloosa’s proposal. Allergan, under pressure to bolster its sagging stock price, launched a review of its strategy last year. That review is only likely to result in the sale of its relatively small infectious disease unit. Appaloosa has voiced its discontent with the results of the review and has called for a breakup or sale of the company, citing recent clinical failures such as that of Allergan’s depression treatment rapastinel. Saunders was instrumental in putting Allergan together through a series of deals with companies including Forest Laboratories Inc and Actavis Plc.  But Saunders’ biggest deal, Allergan’s $160 billion sale to Pfizer Inc was killed in 2016 after the U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration changed the rules on corporate tax inversions. Allergan’s shares have lost nearly half their value since then. (This story corrects paragraph 1 to show Appaloosa’s resolution was non-binding).

712,"Hedge fund Voce urges Argo to slash expenses, nominates five directors - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  9:04 PM / in 7 days","2 Min ReadBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - An activist hedge fund on Tuesday nominated five directors and urged insurance company Argo Group International Holdings Ltd to cut $100 million in expenses, including corporate jets and housing for its chief executive. Voce Capital Management LLC wants Argo shareholders to back its plan to double return on equity at the company’s annual meeting next month, saying the current board is responsible for a “culture of indulgence,” according to a securities filing, seen by Reuters. Voce, a $250 million hedge fund run by J. Daniel Plants, said Argo’s return on equity could climb to over 10 percent from an average of 5.7 percent if it slashed expenses such as the jets, sponsorships and CEO pay and housing, including a waterfront villa in Bermuda and a penthouse apartment in New York City.  “The numbers Plants has put forward are fantasy,” an Argo representative said. The hedge fund owns 5.6 percent of $2.4 billion Argo, which specializes in insurance and reinsurance products in property and casualty insurance. Voce announced plans to push for changes in February. Voce’s director candidates have global insurance and capital allocation expertise plus public company board experience. Voce proposes to replace five directors, including ones not up for re-election now, and called the current board weak.

713,Buffett's Berkshire helps bankroll Occidental's $38 billion bid for Anadarko - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:08 PM / in 7 days","4 Min Read(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc committed $10 billion on Tuesday to Occidental Petroleum Corp’s $38 billion cash-and-stock bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, boosting its chances of snatching a deal from Chevron Corp. Occidental and Chevron are locked in the biggest oil-industry takeover battle in years as they eye Anadarko’s prized assets in West Texas’ huge Permian shale oilfield. Anadarko on Monday agreed to start negotiations with Occidental, saying its bid may potentially be superior to Chevron’s existing deal to buy Anadarko for $33 billion in cash and stock. Berkshire’s cash provides Occidental with flexibility to fund and even increase its proposal. Anadarko has previously expressed reservations about the risk of Occidental having to get any deal voted through by its own shareholders.  Occidental could now use the majority of the Berkshire investment to add cash to its bid and remove the requirement for a vote, if it so chooses. T. Rowe Price Group, an influential Occidental shareholder, said on Tuesday it was “very concerned” about the deal, and that it could vote against the board at Occidental’s upcoming shareholder meeting if the company tried to circumvent giving stockholders a say on the Anadarko transaction, according to a report on Barron’s website. T. Rowe Price is Occidental’s sixth-largest shareholder, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The Berkshire investment, contingent on Occidental completing its proposed acquisition of Anadarko, could also repay some of the debt being taken on to finance the deal’s cash portion, or cover the $10 billion to $15 billion of proceeds from asset sales which Occidental plans in the two years after closing the acquisition. Analysts said Buffett’s endorsement supports Occidental’s push to get the deal done but comes at a high cost. Berkshire Hathaway will get 100,000 preferred shares and a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of Occidental at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, a statement from Occidental said. The preferred stock will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum, compared with about 5 percent yield on common equity and 4 percent on term debt, Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Matthew Portillo said. “For Occidental shareholders, our view is this is a fairly expensive cost of financing for the transaction even though it carries a kind of nice headline of having Berkshire Hathaway participate in the potential financing here.” It is rare for Buffett to participate in a bidding war for a company. The last time he did this was in 2016, supporting a consortium including Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert that tried unsuccessfully to buy Yahoo Inc’s internet assets. Shares of Occidental closed 2.1% lower at $58.88, while Anadarko shares were down about 0.1% at $72.85. Chevron shares rose 2% to $120.06. A Chevron spokesman reiterated that the San Roman, California-based company believes its “signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders.” Occidental and Chevron, two of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian by production volumes, argue they can best squeeze more oil from Anadarko’s 240,000 acres (97,120 hectares)in the area. The two companies control land adjacent to Anadarko’s properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.

714,Puerto Rico board files flurry of lawsuits ahead of claim deadline - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:00 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s federally created financial oversight board on Tuesday began filing the first round of scores of lawsuits seeking to recover money the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth paid to bondholders, businesses and others. The board has until the end of this week to file certain claims after the U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases declined to extend an expiring two-year statute of limitations.  More than 230 complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico targeting about $4.2 billion in payments made by the island’s government, according to the board. Defendants include pharmaceutical maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Puerto Rico Inc, as well as individuals and local companies that provide educational, health, IT, security, construction and communication services. “The oversight board has a responsibility to the people of Puerto Rico to recover any payments in contravention of bankruptcy or Puerto Rico law made prior to the commonwealth’s bankruptcy,” board executive director Natalie Jaresko said in a statement.   The legal actions cover a period dating back as far as four years before Puerto Rico filed for bankruptcy on May 3, 2017, in an effort to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.  Legal arguments for the claims include that these payments “deviate from historical payment patterns,” were made “in the absence of a contract,” or do not correspond to existing contracts. Claims would be dismissed against defendants who can show “a proper basis for the payments.”  A spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb said, “We do not comment on ongoing litigation.” The board contends that Puerto Rico was insolvent at the time these payments were made. The parties being sued “knew or should have known that the commonwealth was insolvent, in the vicinity of insolvency, or unable to satisfy its obligations as they became due,” the fiscal panel argues. A deluge of lawsuits is also expected this week against owners of general obligation bonds the island issued in 2012 and 2014. The board wants to recoup payments made to bondholders if the court grants its motion to invalidate the bonds because they were issued in violation of a debt limit in Puerto Rico’s constitution. On Monday, the board informed the court it is targeting investors who owned $2.5 million or more of the bonds any time between May 3, 2013, and May 21, 2017. Claims would also be pursued against 27 bond underwriters, nine law firms, and five accounting firms, according to an attorney for the oversight board.

715,Republicans block U.S. Senate Democrats' move on making Mueller report public - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  9:19 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on Monday blocked a second attempt by Democrats to pass a measure aimed at prodding the Justice Department to release to the public Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted 420-0 in favor of making the report public, with no Republican opposition. On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr informed Congress that Mueller had concluded that President Donald Trump’s campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. But the probe left unresolved the question of whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice. “There is no good reason not to make the report public,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. The Justice Department has not said whether it will release Mueller’s full report, but Barr has said he will be as transparent as possible. McConnell, noting that it took nearly two years for Mueller to conduct his investigation, said: “It’s not unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department just a little time to complete their review in a professional and responsible manner.” The legislation does not set a deadline for the release of the report, and merely expresses Congress’ desire that it should be made publicly available. The chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, said on CNN on Sunday that he would “try to negotiate” with the Justice Department to obtain the full report, but the committee would issue subpoenas and litigate if needed.  Trump vented his anger on Monday at the Mueller inquiry and vowed investigations into unnamed political enemies who did “very, very evil” and “treasonous things.” Trump pledged new investigations but did not specify who would conduct them or who should be targeted. Trump in the past has called for investigations of Hillary Clinton, the Democrat he defeated in 2016.

716,Congress faces long road ahead in fight over Mueller documents - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  9:14 PM / a month ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Lawmakers seeking Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report are likely to face a protracted legal battle that will turn on President Donald Trump’s right to keep communications with his advisers private, legal and political experts said.  On Sunday, U.S. Attorney General William Barr sent a summary to lawmakers saying the Mueller investigation found Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign did not conspire with Russia. But the probe left unresolved the question of whether Trump engaged in obstruction of justice, setting out “evidence on both sides of the question.” Barr concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring an obstruction case against Trump, prompting Democratic lawmakers to call for the release of the full report and the underlying evidence Mueller relied on. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, said on CNN on Sunday he would “try to negotiate” with the Justice Department to obtain the full report, but that the committee would issue subpoenas and litigate if needed. Other Democrats, including candidates vying for the 2020 presidential nomination, have called for release of the full report. The Justice Department has not said whether it will release  Mueller’s full report, but Barr has said he will be as transparent as possible. Ross Garber, a lawyer in Washington focusing on political investigations, said Congress would have a difficult time persuading judges to release materials marked as classified or privileged by the executive branch, and that even a successful challenge could take years.  “Congress faces substantial legal and procedural hurdles in any effort to get these materials,” Garber said. Barr is required by law to keep secret information obtained from grand jury proceedings. This would not apply to information obtained from Trump advisers and other witnesses who agreed to sit down voluntarily with Mueller. Barr could also keep parts of the report under wraps by invoking a Justice Department policy against disparaging individuals who have not been charged with crimes. The most contentious fight will likely be over any materials the White House tries to shield from public view by claiming executive privilege, a legal doctrine generally used to keep conversations between the president and advisers private. The doctrine is rooted in the idea that the president should be able to receive candid advice on policy matters. If Barr withholds information based on executive privilege or Justice Department policy, Democrats could bring a lawsuit seeking to force disclosure. But it could be months before the Democrat-led House is even in a position to sue, legal experts said. Lawmakers would first need to make a formal demand for the report by invoking their subpoena power. If Barr refused to release it, Democrats would then vote to hold him in contempt of Congress, experts said.  Congress would then sue to enforce its contempt finding. Legal experts said that, while executive privilege has been recognized by the Supreme Court, it must be narrowly asserted and balanced against Congress’ need for information to fulfill its duty of oversight over the executive branch.  Garber said an executive privilege claim would be particularly strong if it were invoked to keep private the nature of Trump’s private conversations with close advisers, like former White House lawyer Don McGahn, who sat for interviews with Mueller’s team.   Those sorts of communications are exactly what the privilege is intended to keep private, Garber said. But Mitchel Sollenberger, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, said courts would be sympathetic to arguments by lawmakers that they need more information about the Mueller investigation to do their job. In 2012, Republican lawmakers sued Democratic President Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, to obtain documents over a federal law enforcement operation targeting gun traffickers, code-named Fast and Furious. The litigation dragged on for six years before ending in a settlement that called for the production of documents after Obama and Holder had already left office.  John Marston, a former federal prosecutor in Washington now at law firm Foley Hoag, said it would be in the best interests of both Democratic lawmakers and the public to compromise with Barr and avoid a protracted court fight. “I’m sure there are many ways to structure access to a significant amount of this information,” Marston said. “Negotiating and finding a common agreement on access to the materials would help us all move past this.” Reporting by Jan  Wolfe; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

717,U.S. Senate Republican wants a special counsel to investigate Trump probe - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  3:17 PM / a month ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading Senate Republican said on Monday he would ask Attorney General William Barr to appoint a special counsel to probe whether U.S. law enforcement officials made missteps in their investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia. A day after the attorney general said the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller found Trump’s campaign did not conspire with Russia, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said: “We will begin to unpack the other side of the story.” He said it was time to look at the origins of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant for former Trump adviser Carter Page, which was based in part on information in a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who co-founded a private intelligence firm.  Graham told reporters he planned to ask Barr to appoint a special counsel to investigate the FISA matter, which is already being probed by the Justice Department’s internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz. A spokesman for Graham said later that Barr agreed to appear before the Judiciary Committee after he vets Mueller’s report. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Graham’s request. Graham said he would use subpoena power if necessary, whether or not a special counsel is appointed. He added he also had lingering questions about the FBI’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Republican lawmakers have contended the FBI made serious missteps when it sought the warrant to monitor Page in October 2016 shortly after he left the Trump campaign. Page, a foreign policy adviser during Trump’s campaign, drew scrutiny from the FBI, which said in legal filings in 2016 that it believed he had been “collaborating and conspiring” with the Kremlin. Page met with several Russian government officials during a trip to Moscow in July 2016. He was not charged. Fusion GPS, a Washington-based political research firm, was initially contracted to investigate Trump on behalf of Republicans who wanted to stop Trump’s bid for the party’s nomination. Fusion later hired Steele to investigate Trump, and the firm was paid for Steele’s dossier work by a law firm connected to Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, said Graham had the prerogative as chairman to bring whatever he wants before the committee. But told of Graham’s interest in Clinton’s emails, Feinstein said to reporters: “Well, haven’t we had enough of it? Look how many years it’s been.” Former FBI Director James Comey said in August 2016 that no charges would be brought against Clinton over the matter.

718,US STOCKS-Wall St's recent rally stumbles as Alphabet falls - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:18 PM / 7 days ago","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Alphabet falls, day after revenue miss * Merck, Pfizer rise after earnings beat * GE jumps on higher profit, slower cash burn * Indexes: Dow up 0.1%, S&P 500 down 0.01%, Nasdaq off 0.7% (Updates to late afternoon) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell and S&P 500 was flat Tuesday after hitting all-time highs in the previous session as shares of Google-parent Alphabet tumbled following a revenue miss and Apple dropped ahead of its results. The two major indexes set records on Monday as investors took comfort from a largely positive earnings season, benign inflation data and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Despite the drop, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq are set to post their best monthly gains since January. Alphabet Inc shares fell 8.1% and were on track for their worst decline since January 2012, after the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years. The S&P communication services sector slid, and was on pace for its biggest percentage fall in over four months. Apple Inc dropped 1.7% ahead of results after the bell, which will wrap up earnings for the high-growth FAANG stocks. “The big negative today are questions with regard to some of the large tech stocks. Alphabet’s gotten slapped, and Apple is down. It hasn’t reported yet, but it looks like right now the bet is negative,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “But all in all, things for the market are looking pretty decent: a friendly Fed, low rates, growing earnings. It doesn’t get much better than that.” With more than half of the S&P 500 companies reporting, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to have risen 0.7%, a stark reversal from the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. In a big day for healthcare, Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co Inc rose after the drugmakers beat quarterly earnings estimates. The Fed’s two-day meeting that ends Wednesday will also be in focus for hints on the direction of interest rates. Limiting losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was Chevron Corp. The company’s shares rose 2.1% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc committed $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum Corp’s bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, boosting its chances of snatching a deal from Chevron. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.26 points, or 0.05%, to 26,568.65, the S&P 500 lost 0.27 points, or 0.01%, to 2,942.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 58.68 points, or 0.72%, to 8,103.17. General Electric Co jumped after the industrial conglomerate’s first-quarter profit rose and its negative cash flow was smaller than expected. Mastercard Inc rose to a record after the card company beat estimates for quarterly profit. Perrigo Co Plc slid after a revised notice from the tax authorities proposed additional liability. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, a 1.59-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 37 new lows.

721,"U.S. inflation muted, economic outlook strengthening - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  12:58 PM / 7 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. labor costs increased steadily in the first quarter as a jump in transportation and manufacturing wages was offset by small gains elsewhere, pointing to moderate inflation pressures even as the labor market tightens. Other data on Tuesday showed a rebound in consumer confidence this month amid growing labor market optimism. While  house prices increased at their slowest pace since 2012 in February, slowing house price inflation is stimulating demand for homes. The signs of the economy’s brightening prospects and benign price pressures came as Federal Reserve officials began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Citing cross-currents facing the economy, the U.S. central bank in March dropped its forecasts for any rate increases this year, halting a three-year policy tightening campaign. The Fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018.  Inflation has retreated further from the Fed’s 2 percent target, catching the attention of President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the central bank’s past rate hikes. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that the economy could go “up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing.” While economists agree that inflation is low, most do not believe the Fed should be easing monetary policy.  “Inflation really isn’t an issue right now, it looks like the outlook for growth is strengthening,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. “At this stage, the Fed can stay on the sidelines and rate cuts at this juncture are premature.” The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7 percent after advancing by the same margin in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said. That lowered the year-on-year rate of increase in the ECI to 2.8 percent. Labor costs rose 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, which was the largest gain since June 2008. The first-quarter rise in the ECI was in line with economists’ expectations. The ECI is widely viewed as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation. The government reported on Monday that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, the smallest increase since January 2018 and down from 1.7 percent in February. The so-called core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. Wall Street’s main stock indexes were trading mixed after hitting record highs in the previous session. In separate report on Tuesday, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 129.2 this month from 124.2 in March. That jump strengthened the view that consumer spending will accelerate after growing at its slowest pace in a year in the first quarter. “The Fed puts more store in consumer confidence as a predictor of consumer spending behavior, and from this perspective the Fed should be reassured that the second quarter looks strong on the consumer spending front,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. The survey’s so-called labor market differential, derived from data about respondents saying jobs are scarce or plentiful, jumped to 33.5 percent from 28.7 percent in March. This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department’s employment report. The rise in labor market differential together with dwindling numbers of people on unemployment rolls raises the possibility the jobless rate could drop in April from its current level of 3.8 percent. The government will publish its April employment report on Friday. But consumers’ inflation expectations fell this month. With the labor market continuing to tighten, there is optimism wage growth will pick up a notch this year. There is growing anecdotal evidence of companies struggling to find workers.  In the first quarter, wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, increased 0.7 percent after rising 0.6 percent in the prior period. Wages and salaries were up 2.9 percent in the 12 months through March. That followed a 3.1 percent gain in the year through December. There were strong wage gains in the manufacturing, construction and transportation industries, but compensation slowed in the professional and business services, education and health services sectors as well as in the leisure and hospitality industry. A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas rose 3.0 percent in February from a year ago. That was the smallest gain since September 2012 and followed a 3.5 percent increase in January.  Growth in house prices has slowed from as high as 6.8 percent in March 2018. The moderation in prices followed an ebb in demand after mortgage rates spiked last year. Mortgage rates have since declined. That, together with lower prices, is helping stimulate demand for homes, though supply remains tight. A fourth report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded 3.8 percent to an eight-month high in March after dropping 1.0 percent in February. “As long as mortgage rates remain near current levels, sales activity should trend higher this year, although low inventory levels will likely cap housing sector expansion to some degree,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

723,"Argentine labor unions stage strike, slam Macri for subsidy cuts - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  6:35 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine labor unions staged a 24-hour nationwide strike on Tuesday against President Mauricio Macri’s fiscal austerity program, blocking streets in the capital Buenos Aires and shutting down traffic in the city center. The protests partially paralyzed government offices, schools, banks and airports as opposition to Macri’s belt-tightening policies raised fresh doubts about his bid for re-election in October.  A proponent of free markets, Macri came to office in 2015 as a favorite among business leaders and investors. Opinion polls show him losing popularity as he raises taxes and cuts public utility subsidies as part of his effort to erase the primary fiscal deficit under his government’s $56 billion standby lending agreement with the International Monetary Fund. “This president is dangerous!” Pablo Micheli, head of the CTA umbrella labor group shouted to a sea of protesters gathered in Buenos Aires’ Plaza de Mayo. “We must hold more strikes and marches to keep these guys from taking any more away from us.” Argentina’s previous leader, Cristina Fernandez, a free-spending populist who increased government’s role in the economy, has been gaining popularity and may run for the presidency again in October. Macri campaigned on promises of “normalizing” the economy after eight years of government intervention in the markets under Fernandez. “To go back to the past would be self destruction. It would mean sacrificing two or three more generations,” Macri said in an address on Tuesday at an event outside the capital. The peso hit a record low on Friday, ending a tough week for local markets buffeted by anxiety over Argentina’s recession, 54% inflation and the upcoming election. The peso got a 3.37 percent boost on Monday after the central bank said it may increase dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to control the slide of the local currency, which lost 2.12 percent of its value against the dollar in April. The peso inched up another 0.18 percent on Tuesday to close the session at 44.29 per dollar. But the country’s economic outlook remained murky as poverty increases and business chokes on benchmark interest rates of nearly 74 percent.

727,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Equities dip on China data, Alphabet results; euro strengthens - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  6:03 PM / in 7 days","4 Min Read* S&P 500, Nasdaq retreat from record levels * Surveys suggest slower Chinese factory growth this month * Euro zone GDP grows more strongly than expected (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - Global equity markets edged lower on Tuesday, weighed by weak Chinese business surveys and a tumble in shares of Google parent Alphabet, while the euro strengthened on the heels of data that showed euro zone growth topped expectations. Shares of Alphabet dropped more than 8%, making it the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes a day after both hit record levels, as the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years. Fellow heavyweight Apple is scheduled to report results after the market close on Tuesday. “People are definitely taking some profits off names like Apple, Google. There could be a little ‘peaking’ mentality here considering how indexes are at record levels, people tend to get a bit cautious,” said Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minnesota. “Large-cap companies have generally reported better-than-expected numbers but not the kind that would accelerate a rally.” Equity markets were also on shaky footing after surveys on China manufacturing missed forecasts, another sign that Beijing’s efforts to spur growth in the world’s second-biggest economy had yet to take hold. Investors were looking ahead to a policy statement from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and payrolls data at the end of the week. The Fed is largely expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it seeks to balance solid economic growth against low inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.71 points, or 0.06%, to 26,570.1, the S&P 500 gained 0.04 points, or 0.00%, to 2,943.07 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 53.52 points, or 0.66%, to 8,108.34. Despite the disappointing Alphabet results, corporate profits for the quarter are now showing growth of 0.7%, according to Refinitiv data, which has helped ease worries about a possible earnings recession. After seesawing between gains and losses, European stocks ended flat as bank weakness undercut encouraging euro zone data indicating economic growth in the first quarter was much stronger than expected and the unemployment rate fell to its lowest in more than a decade. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.01% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.10%. The encouraging regional data helped the euro strengthen to above $1.12 for the first time in a week to a high of $1.1230. The dollar remained subdued against a basket of major currencies even after a round of upbeat data on housing and consumer confidence. The dollar index fell 0.41%, with the euro up 0.31% to $1.122. Brent crude earlier topped $73 but then pulled back as the market grew less worried that a rebellion against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro would hit the country’s crude exports. U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $64.07 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.28, up 1.03% on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.509%, from 2.536% late on Monday.

728,Explainer: Why an obstruction case against Trump was so difficult - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  2:38 AM / in a month","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr’s conclusion that President Donald Trump did not obstruct justice, revealed publicly on Sunday in a letter to lawmakers, reflects inherent difficulties in proving such an obstruction case, legal experts said.    Barr sent a four-page letter to congressional leaders summarizing a report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller handed in on Friday, which remains confidential. Mueller was appointed to investigate whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election and to probe whether the president later unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe.  Mueller vindicated Trump on the core question of Russian collusion, writing in his report that “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” according to Barr’s letter. While Mueller stopped short of determining whether Trump obstructed justice, Barr concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring such a case. Following are some reasons why proving an obstruction case against Trump was so difficult and what may lay ahead.  WHAT DID MUELLER SAY ABOUT AN OBSTRUCTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP? Mueller said he did not reach a finding on whether Trump obstructed justice and set out “evidence on both sides of the question,” according to Barr’s letter. Barr did not make this evidence public, noting only that Mueller said there were “difficult” factual and legal questions raised by an obstruction case. Muller said “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” according to Barr’s letter.  Barr, however, found there was insufficient evidence to establish an obstruction case against Trump. A federal law makes it a crime to attempt “to influence, obstruct or impede the due administration of justice.” To prove obstruction, prosecutors must show an individual acted with a “corrupt,” or improper motive - a specific intent to impede an investigation.  Mueller’s obstruction investigation likely focused on Trump’s interactions with former FBI director James Comey, legal experts said.  According to Comey, in February 2017 Trump asked him to back off an investigation into national security adviser Michael Flynn over Flynn’s contacts with Russia. Trump eventually fired Comey in May 2017. “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go ... He is a good guy,” Trump told Comey, according to a memo written by the former FBI director. Some legal experts have said in the last year that Trump’s intent was clearly to block an investigation, and that there was a strong obstruction of justice case to be made. But others have said that establishing that Trump acted with the “corrupt” intent of blocking the investigation would have been difficult. Trump could have argued he was simply vouching for Flynn’s character, and not pressuring Comey to drop an investigation, these lawyers said. In an interview with NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt that aired two days after the firing, Trump said he was thinking of “this Russia thing” when he fired him. But Trump also said in the NBC interview and in others that he fired Comey because he was incompetent, weakening a potential obstruction case, experts said. An obstruction of justice case against Trump was also undermined by Mueller’s findings that the Trump campaign did not conspire with Russians to interfere in the election. Obstruction of justice is usually coupled with some underlying wrongful act that is being covered up, experts said. Barr cited this shortcoming in his letter, saying that, “while not determinative, the absence of such evidence bears upon the president’s intent with respect to obstruction.” Barr’s letter also notes that obstruction, like any crime, requires to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in court.  Barr also noted that many of the actions described in Mueller’s report “took place in public view.” Obstruction of justice typically describe secret efforts to impede a court proceeding, and Barr may have viewed the public nature of Trump’s acts as weakening the case against him. Yes. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January, giving them investigatory powers including the ability to issue subpoenas. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement on Sunday that the fact that Mueller had not cleared Trump of obstruction “demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay.” The U.S. Constitution empowers Congress to remove a president from office for “high crimes and misdemeanors,” including obstruction of justice through a process of impeachment.  In an impeachment proceeding, lawmakers have broad leeway to define obstruction of justice and are not bound by Barr’s determination, legal experts said. But impeachment is a very political process, and appears unlikely because Trump’s Republican party controls the Senate. Some Democratic lawmakers had hoped Mueller’s investigation would lay a groundwork for impeachment, but that hope has now largely faded.

729,White House says pardons for Trump associates not discussed - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  2:38 PM / a month ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - There have been no conversations about President Donald Trump issuing pardons for any of his associates who have been charged or pleaded guilty as part of the U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, the White House said on Monday. There has been “no discussion that I’m aware of” regarding pardons, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. Fellow White House spokesman Hogan Gidley also told MSNBC in an interview that the White House has not had any conversations about such pardons. Gidley said he did not know whether any lawyers for Trump’s associates had approached the White House counsel about pardons. Mueller’s team finished up work on Friday and submitted its findings to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who issued a four-page summary on Sunday. Barr said the Special Counsel’s Office had found no evidence of criminal collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the 2016 election but had left open the issue of whether Trump had tried to obstruct justice. Still, Mueller’s investigation led to charges and guilty pleas against dozens of people, including a series of Russian nationals and companies as well as several top Trump advisers, such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and former adviser Roger Stone.   “We have a very rigorous process that relates to pardons,” Gidley told MSNBC.

730,Explainer: Why Trump's legal woes go beyond the Mueller report - Reuters,"March 24, 2019 /  8:11 PM / in a month","10 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The closure of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election does not mark the end of legal worries for President Donald Trump and people close to him. Other continuing investigations and litigation are focusing on issues including his businesses and financial dealings, personal conduct, charitable foundation and inaugural committee. The special counsel on Friday submitted his confidential report on the investigation to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who must decide on how much of it to make public. On Sunday Barr released a summary of Mueller’s findings that said the investigation did not find that President Donald Trump committed a crime but also does not exonerate him. The summary also said Mueller found no evidence that any member of Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russia during the election. While Mueller’s probe has ended, the other investigations, pursued by prosecutors at the federal and state level, could result in charges beyond those brought by Mueller or civil liability. The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges, so such a case against Trump would be unlikely while he is in office even if there were evidence of wrongdoing. Some legal experts have argued the department is wrong and that a president is not immune from prosecution. Either way, Trump potentially could face charges once he is out of office.  Here is an explanation of some criminal investigations and civil lawsuits still under way. Mueller charged 34 individuals and three companies. Several of those cases resulted in guilty pleas and one case went to trial, with former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort convicted in August 2018 of eight criminal counts, including bank fraud and tax fraud. Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was indicted in January of this year and pleaded not guilty, but his trial is still pending. There are other cases involving indicted Russians that have not gone to trial. Other prosecutors within the Justice Department will likely take over criminal cases begun by Mueller, legal experts said. Trump may face significant peril from federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to legal experts. His former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in Feb. 27 congressional testimony that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is examining Trump’s business practices and financial dealings. Cohen already has implicated Trump in campaign finance law violations to which he pleaded guilty in August 2018 as part of the Southern District investigation. Cohen admitted he violated campaign finance laws by arranging, at Trump’s direction, “hush money” payments shortly before the 2016 presidential election to porn film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal to prevent damage to Trump’s candidacy. Both women said they had sexual relationships with Trump more than a decade ago. He has denied that. Prosecutors said the payments constituted illegal campaign contributions intended to influence the election. Under federal election laws, such donations cannot exceed $2,700 and need to be publicly disclosed. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, received $130,000. McDougal received $150,000. The New York investigation has involved longtime Trump ally David Pecker, publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, who admitted to paying McDougal for the rights to her story and then suppressing it to influence the election, an arrangement called “catch and kill.”  During his Feb. 27 congressional hearing, Cohen said he was in “constant contact” with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, and said other crimes and wrongdoing by Trump are being investigated by them, though he did not offer details. Cohen said he could not testify about the nature of his last conversation with Trump in early 2018 because it was under investigation by the federal prosecutors in New York. The Manhattan district attorney’s office is exploring criminal charges against Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, over financial crimes related to unpaid state taxes and possibly loans. In cases bought by Mueller, Manafort in 2018 was convicted of tax fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts in Virginia and pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in Washington. He was sentenced to a combined 7-1/2 years in prison in the two cases. Trump has not ruled out granting Manafort a pardon. The president would not be able to pardon Manafort if he is convicted of charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney because they would not be federal crimes. However, New York has broad double-jeopardy protections that usually prevent the state from prosecuting a person for crimes arising from the same criminal conduct the federal government has prosecuted before. A defamation lawsuit against Trump by Summer Zervos, a  former contestant on his reality television show “The Apprentice,” continues in New York state court after a judge in 2018 allowed it to proceed. Zervos sued Trump after he called her and other women who have accused him of sexual misconduct liars and retweeted a post labeling her claims a hoax. Trump has agreed to provide written answers to questions from Zervos by Sept. 28, according to a court filing. Zervos accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her at a meeting at a hotel in California. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them years before he entered politics. Marc Kasowitz, a lawyer for Trump, had argued that the lawsuit unconstitutionally impedes the president from performing his duties. An appeals court rejected that argument on March 14 by a 3-2 vote. Kasowitz said he would appeal the decision to the state’s  highest court. Separately, two lawsuits against Trump brought by porn star Stormy Daniels were dismissed. A lawsuit filed by the New York state Attorney General’s Office has already led the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which was presented as the charitable arm of Trump’s business empire, to agree in December 2018 to dissolve, and the litigation continues.  The state is seeking an order banning Trump and his three eldest children from leadership roles in any other New York charity. Trump has said the lawsuit was concocted by “sleazy New York Democrats.” The state’s Democratic attorney general accused the foundation of being “engaged in a “shocking pattern of illegality” and “functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump’s business and political interests” in violation of federal law. The attorney general’s office alleged Trump and his family members used the charity to pay off his legal debts and purchase personal items. The foundation agreed to dissolve and give away all its remaining assets under court supervision. Trump is accused in a lawsuit filed by the Democratic attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia of violating anti-corruption provisions of the U.S. Constitution through his businesses’ dealings with foreign governments. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on March 19 in the Trump administration’s appeal of U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte’s 2018 rulings allowing the case to proceed. The Constitution’s “emoluments clause” bars U.S. officials from accepting payments from foreign governments and the governments of U.S. states without congressional approval. The lawsuit stated that because Trump did not divest himself of his business empire, spending by foreign governments at the Trump International Hotel in Washington amounts to unconstitutional gifts, or “emoluments,” to the president. The three appeals court judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, expressed approval toward Trump’s arguments in the case and signaled they might dismiss it, but did not issue a ruling. Some experts have said the case will eventually be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating whether the committee that organized Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 accepted illegal donations from foreigners, misused funds or brokered special access to the administration for donors. Federal election law prohibits foreigners from donating to U.S. political campaigns or inaugural committees, and corruption laws ban donors from making contributions in exchange for political favors. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in December 2018 that the president was not involved in his inaugural committee. The $107 million raised by the committee, which was chaired by real estate developer and investor Thomas Barrack, was the largest in history, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Under the Constitution, the president, vice president and “all civil officers of the United States” can be removed from office by Congress through the impeachment process for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The House of Representatives acts as the accuser - voting on whether to bring specific charges such as obstruction of justice - and the Senate then conducts a trial with House members acting as prosecutors and the individual senators serving as jurors. A simple majority vote is needed in the House to impeach. A two-thirds majority is required in the Senate to convict and remove.

731,US STOCKS-Nasdaq retreats as Alphabet falls but Apple gains after hours - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  8:58 PM / 7 days ago","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Alphabet falls, day after revenue miss * Merck, Pfizer rise after earnings beat * GE jumps on higher profit, slower cash burn * Indexes: Dow up 0.2%, S&P 500 up 0.1%, Nasdaq off 0.7% (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq fell on Tuesday as shares of Google-parent Alphabet tumbled following a revenue miss and Apple dropped, though the S&P 500 eked out another record closing high. All three major indexes posted their best monthly percentage gains since January, wrapping up a month that brought the S&P 500 and Nasdaq back to record-high territory and helped to restore investors’ belief in the decade-long bull run. A less-worse-than-expected earnings season, positive economic data and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks have helped drive the recent gains. Weighing on the Nasdaq Tuesday and limiting gains in the S&P 500, Alphabet Inc shares fell 7.5% and were on track for their worst decline since January 2012, after the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years. The S&P communication services sector slid 2.5%, dragged down by Alphabet, and registered its biggest percentage fall in about four months. “The big negative today are questions with regard to some of the large tech stocks. Alphabet’s gotten slapped, and Apple is down,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “But all in all, things for the market are looking pretty decent: a friendly Fed, low rates, growing earnings. It doesn’t get much better than that.” Apple shares dropped 1.9% during the session, but reversed course and were trading up 4.3% after the bell following the release of its results. S&P 500 e-mini futures also jumped after Apple’s results and were last up 0.4%. With more than half of the S&P 500 companies reporting, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to have risen slightly, a stark reversal from the 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. During the regular session, Pfizer Inc and Merck & Co Inc rose more than 2% each after the drugmakers beat quarterly earnings estimates. The Fed’s two-day meeting that ends Wednesday will be in focus for hints on the direction of interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also ended higher, helped by gains in Chevron Corp. The company’s shares rose 2% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc committed $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum Corp’s bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, boosting its chances of snatching a deal from Chevron. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.52 points, or 0.15%, to 26,592.91, the S&P 500 gained 2.8 points, or 0.10%, to 2,945.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 54.01 points, or 0.66%, to 8,095.39. For the month, the Dow rose 2.6%, the S&P 500 gained 3.9% and the Nasdaq added 4.9%. General Electric Co jumped 4.5% after the industrial conglomerate’s first-quarter profit rose and its negative cash flow was smaller than expected. Mastercard Inc rose after the card company beat estimates for quarterly profit. Perrigo Co Plc slid after a revised notice from the tax authorities proposed additional liability. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 78 new highs and 45 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.22 billion shares, compared to the 6.56 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Shares of Alphabet dropped 7.8%, making it the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes a day after both hit record highs, as the company reported its slowest revenue growth in three years. Fellow heavyweight Apple is scheduled to report results after the market close on Tuesday. Equity markets started the day on shaky footing after surveys on China’s manufacturing missed forecasts, another sign that Beijing’s efforts to spur growth in the world’s second-biggest economy had yet to take hold. Major U.S. indexes were able to move off their lows, however, after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said U.S. President Donald Trump agreed with Democratic leaders to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure and White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said talks between the United States and China aimed at resolving their trade dispute will likely be resolved “one way or the other” in the next two weeks. “Between the news about some sort of theoretical infrastructure bill and continuing trade headlines about a China deal being done whenever the latest timetable is - that was enough to get sellers to step back from the edge a little bit,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.   Investors were looking ahead to a policy statement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and payrolls data at the end of the week. The Fed is largely expected to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged as it seeks to balance solid economic growth against low inflation. “People are kind of looking to see what is next before they take a step out in one direction or the other,” said Delwiche.

At a lunch presentation in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel overlooking New York’s Central Park, where fusilli pasta and BLT club wraps were served to investors, Khosrowshahi said Uber’s future was not as a ride-hailing company, but as a wide technology platform shaping logistics and transportation. “Dara was very impressive, he did a good job articulating the story,” said one of the investors who attended, who requested anonymity because the presentation was closed to the media. Uber is set to price its $10 billion IPO on May 9, seeking a valuation of up to $90 billion. Investors attending the roadshow said Uber’s IPO book was quickly oversubscribing, making a pop in the shares of the company on its first day of trading more likely. Uber declined to comment on how much demand there is for its IPO. Uber executives arrived in New York after their roadshow in London on Monday. In a ballroom at Claridge’s, the five-star hotel in London’s wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company’s plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping. In New York, Uber executives fielded questions ranging from autonomous driving to plans to enter into the grocery business.  Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit, and faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability. Uber follows smaller rival Lyft Inc, which went public with a $24 billion valuation. Lyft’s shares are down more than 17 percent since its IPO on March 28, amid investor skepticism over its path to profitability. Khosrowshahi is also tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed Uber’s culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years. Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO. Uber’s IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp.

736,"As Fed meets, Trump calls for sharp rate cut, stimulus - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  6:20 PM / in 7 days","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, in perhaps his most unorthodox statement yet on monetary policy, called for the U.S. Federal Reserve to act as if the country was back in the throes of recession, with sharp interest rate cuts and renewed “quantitative easing” to pump trillions of dollars into the economy. As Fed officials met in Washington for their latest policy discussion, Trump on Tuesday tweeted that it would send the U.S. economy “up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates, like one point, and some quantitative easing.” It would also likely prove destabilizing to global and U.S. financial markets that would have to adjust to a seemingly capricious decision to cut U.S. interest rates nearly in half for no obvious reason and absorb an uncertain amount of new U.S. dollars. Much smaller, unexpected shifts in policy have led to large swings in the value of the dollar, and put developing countries and their financial institutions under stress. The Fed’s target interest rate currently is set at a range of between 2.25 and 2.5 percent. Reductions of a full percentage point last occurred during the onset of the 2007 to 2009 recession.   The Fed is unlikely to follow Trump’s advice. Policymakers are expected on Wednesday to hold rates steady and to pledge to be “patient” in deciding on any future rate changes. The Fed is also likely to allow the central bank’s asset holdings to continue to shrink - not expand as they would under quantitative easing. Many Republicans, and Trump himself, were critical of quantitative easing when it was introduced during the recession, suggesting it was likely to cause inflation.  But the remarks do show the ongoing tension between the White House and the Fed, even though four of the current five members of the central bank’s board of governors were chosen for their jobs by Trump. In recent weeks his efforts to name more overtly partisan supporters to the Fed have run into opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill, prompting potential nominee Herman Cain to withdraw from consideration and leaving potential nominee Stephen Moore’s fate in doubt.  Trump’s anger at the Fed comes despite recent data showing the economy continuing to grow, and despite the fact that equity markets have regained much of their value since a sharp drop last fall. Trump blamed that sell-off on the Fed’s December rate increase, its fourth of the year, and in effect has asked the Fed to take back all of its rate changes since 2017. Current growth of 3.2 percent is “doing very well...but with our wonderfully low inflation, we could be setting major records,” Trump said in a tweet.  Trump’s criticism of the Fed was prefaced by some admiring comments about China, where, unlike the United States, the central bank is not insulated from the government’s immediate demands.  “China is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low,” Trump said, referring to steps China took in recent months to fight a sharp economic slowdown.

740,Russia probe findings offer re-election weapon for Trump - Reuters,"March 25, 2019 /  1:24 AM / a month ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s conclusion that Donald Trump did not collude with Russia to win the presidency in 2016 gives the president a powerful weapon to use against his Democratic opponents and a potential boost to what is shaping up to be a tough bid for re-election in 2020. Mueller’s conclusion that neither Trump nor his aides conspired with Russia in 2016 takes away a central charge that Democrats have flung at Trump for two years - that he did not win the presidency fairly or cleanly. The allegations have played out on an endless loop on cable TV news shows, overshadowing Trump’s presidency from day one. Democrats have vowed to continue congressional investigations into the 2016 election campaign and Trump’s business practices. But without the solid foundation of a Mueller report that found evidence of any crimes by the president, they now risk seeming to overplay their hand. “This is a gold star day for Donald Trump,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “Now the shackles are off. He’s able to demonize the news media and Democrats as perpetuating what he calls a hoax. And he’ll be able to use his innocence as fodder for the campaign trail.” The question for Trump now is whether he will be able to bring a minimum of discipline to his campaign messaging and to the presidency itself. History suggests he will have trouble with self-discipline. Just last week, he was immersed in a strange fight with a dead man, sharply criticizing the late Republican Senator John McCain and falsely accusing him of being at the root of some of the collusion allegations against him. He has also been prone to making baffling abrupt decisions, such as occurred last week when he called off a round of sanctions against North Korea before they had even been imposed.  Despite the Mueller report’s conclusions, Trump remains an intemperate president, eager to lash out at any and all critics and perceived slights. “This was an illegal takedown that failed,” Trump said on Sunday, even though Mueller left open the question of whether the former real estate magnate had attempted to obstruct the Russia probe, which did find extensive evidence that Russia meddled in the 2016 election.  “Now is the time to get back on the offense on the economy and growth,” said Republican strategist Scott Reed. “This is a good time to get back to a real healthy dose of message discipline for the entire administration, department-wide and the White House. That’s what you do when something like this happens.” Trump, on a golfing weekend in Palm Beach, Florida, got the news in his private quarters at his Mar-a-Lago retreat from White House counsel Emmett Flood, and watched TV coverage of the Mueller report in his cabin on Air Force One. Trump’s initial comments in reacting to the Mueller conclusion suggests he is not inclined to move past the investigation.  Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One for the flight back to Washington, Trump called for Democrats to be investigated, expanding on his often repeated assertion that the Mueller probe was Democrat-inspired. Mueller was appointed by Trump’s Department of Justice in 2017 after he fired FBI director James Comey. “It’s a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest it’s a shame that your president has had to go through this,” Trump said. “Before I even got elected it began, and it began illegally.” Trump’s comments could foreshadow an effort by his supporters to seek payback for the cloud that has hung over his time in the White House. “I’m interested in moving on and trying to get this behind us, but people have to pay for what they’ve done for the past two years,” said former Trump campaign aide David Bossie. “We must investigate the investigators.” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump had no plans to request that his attorney general open an investigation into the president’s political opponents. Trump’s path to re-election remains a perilous one. Analysts say he will probably need to win the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, just as he did in his improbable 2016 victory, and Democrats are already pouring resources into those states. Trump will foreshadow his campaign message on Thursday night when he headlines a “Make America Great Again” rally in Michigan. Trump supporters viewed the Mueller report as a blow to the  more than a dozen Democrats who are campaigning for their party’s 2020 presidential nomination. “This is very problematic for any Democrat who’s running for president in 2020 that was hoping they would face a weakened or beaten-down President Trump,” former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said. “In fact, President Trump will likely see a ratings boost coming out of this and a strong tailwind pushing him towards the upcoming election.” Reuters/Ipsos polling has shown that Americans decided early on in Mueller’s investigation whether they thought Trump was guilty of collusion or not. The polling found few undecided voters. Brinkley said Democrats will need to adjust their tactics and emphasize their differences with Trump’s record on issues ranging from healthcare and climate change to immigration.  “Some of those charges are going to have to rise to be the main charges against Trump,” he said, noting there was fatigue with the Russia issue.

741,"Kremlin, after Mueller report, says it's open to better U.S. ties - Reuters","March 25, 2019 /  10:31 AM / a month ago","2 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is ready to improve ties with the United States but it is up to Washington to make the first move, the Kremlin said on Monday after the conclusion of a U.S. investigation into alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Moscow in the 2016 election. U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a summary released on Sunday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had found no evidence of collusion in his investigation, though had not determined whether Trump obstructed justice by undermining inquiries that have dogged his presidency. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the report on a conference call and said Russia had never interfered and did not plan to interfere in the United States or other countries’ internal affairs and elections.  “...It’s hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat,” Peskov told reporters.   U.S. intelligence agencies said shortly before Trump took office in January 2017 that Moscow meddled in the presidential election with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord in the United States. Commenting on the possibility of an improvement in ties with the United States after the conclusion of the Mueller report, Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had repeatedly stated he was open to shoring up relations.  “In this case, the ball is absolutely in their court. It was given to Trump in Helsinki,” Peskov said, referring to a summit between Putin and Trump in the Finnish capital in July 2018.

The two major indexes broke above record levels on Monday as investors took comfort from a largely positive earnings season, benign inflation data and hints of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Despite the drop, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq are set to clock their best monthly gains since January. Alphabet Inc shares fell 8.28% and were on track for their worst decline since January 2012, after the company also posted its slowest revenue growth in three years. The S&P communication services sector slid 2.68%, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors and was on pace for its biggest percentage fall in over four months. Apple Inc dropped 2.09% ahead of results later in the day, which will wrap up earnings for the high-growth FAANG stocks. “People are definitely taking some profits off names like Apple, Google. There could be a little ‘peaking’ mentality here considering how indexes are at record levels, people tend to get a bit cautious,” said Jeremy Bryan, portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minnesota. “Large-cap companies have generally reported better-than-expected numbers but not the kind that would accelerate a rally.” Limiting losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was Chevron Corp. The company’s shares rose 2.22% after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc put $10 billion behind Occidental Petroleum Corp’s bid for smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp as it tries to see off competition from Chevron. In a big day for healthcare, Pfizer Inc added 3.26% and Merck & Co Inc rose 2.10% after the drugmakers beat quarterly earnings estimates. With over half of the S&P 500 companies reporting, analysts now expect a 0.7% rise in first-quarter profit, a stark reversal from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. General Electric Co gained 3.03% after the industrial conglomerate’s first-quarter profit rose and it lost less cash than expected. Mastercard Inc rose 2.12% to a record after the card company beat estimates for quarterly profit. At 12:50 p.m. ET the Dow was down 40.87 points, or 0.15%, at 26,513.52. The S&P 500 was down 7.37 points, or 0.25%, at 2,935.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 73.16 points, or 0.90%, at 8,088.69. Perrigo Co Plc slid 8.38%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after a revised notice from the tax authorities proposed additional liability. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. The Fed’s two-day meeting starting on Tuesday will also be in focus for hints on the direction of interest rates. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.12-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.97-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 36 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 64 new highs and 36 new lows.

748,Mexican state oil company Pemex swings to loss in first quarter - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  3:24 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Petroleos Mexicanos swung to a 35.7 billion peso ($1.84 billion) net loss during the first quarter as revenues and crude output at the heavily-indebted Mexican state oil company fell, results posted to the stock exchange showed on Tuesday. Revenues at Pemex were 356.3 billion pesos during the January-March period, down 10.4 percent from 397.4 billion pesos in the same period in 2018, the results showed. Pemex, which President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to revive after years of decline, posted a profit of 113.3 billion pesos in the first quarter of last year. Rating agencies have warned that Pemex, which had debt of $106 billion at the end of 2018, runs the risk of having its investment grade credit rating cut to junk.  Loss of the investment grade rating would be a major blow to the administration of Lopez Obrador, a veteran leftist politician who took office in December. Pemex said it had reduced its financial debt by 0.9 percent during the first quarter compared to the end of last year. However, the peso has strengthened against the dollar since then and the debt now stands at $106.5 billion, the company said. Production of crude oil was 1.66 million barrels per day (bpd), a drop of nearly 12 percent from the first quarter of 2018, Pemex said. Output at the company is now half what it was when production peaked at almost 3.4 million bpd in 2004. Pemex executives told a conference call that they expected output to pick up and average 1.725 million bpd this year. Still, the economy has made an inauspicious start to 2019, shrinking by 0.2 percent quarter-on-quarter during the first three months, according to preliminary data.  Lopez Obrador aims to reverse the decline in output and get crude production back to almost 2.5 million bpd by the time he is due to leave office near the end of 2024.

749,California synagogue shooting casts harsh light on mutual-fund darling Cloudflare - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:56 PM / 7 days ago","5 Min ReadBOSTON (Reuters) - The gunmen accused of attacking U.S. synagogues and New Zealand mosques over the past six months brewed their ideas on online hate sites, pulling U.S. cyber-defense firm Cloudflare Inc into a debate on the balance between online speech and security. The attacks have prompted some investors to ask fresh questions about the company’s services allowing the sites to mask their real locations on the Internet to thwart hackers. That is one of the core services used by clients that have more than 12 million Internet properties, including government agencies and major ecommerce operations. “The temperature has turned up,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel for the privately-held San Francisco-based company.  Investors ask questions after Cloudflare’s services were linked to reports about shooters’ activity on hate sites, Kramer said in an interview this week. “They understandably want to know how we think about these things,” Kramer said, declining to name investors. Fidelity Investments and Franklin Resources Inc’s Franklin Templeton funds hold stakes in Cloudflare. Both declined to comment. The alleged gunman who killed one person and wounded three at a San Diego synagogue on Saturday, as well as one who massacred 50 people at New Zealand mosques in March, had posted hate-filled screeds on the 8chan message board, a Cloudflare client. The man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in October did likewise on Gab, also a Cloudflare client, according to Internet records. Cloudflare helped both those sites mask their real Internet protocol addresses. The service obfuscates where its customers are hosted, making it more difficult to hold them accountable, said Micah Schaffer, a technology policy consultant and former Snap Inc executive. Cloudflare does not passively move information, said Alex Stamos, a Stanford University professor who previously served in top cybersecurity roles at Facebook Inc and Yahoo.  “They are cloaking these companies and cloaking the people behind them,” Stamos told the information security “Risky Business” podcast shortly after the New Zealand shootings. Stamos squared off against Islamic State terrorists as Facebook’s chief security officer and said, compared to ISIS, white supremacist terrorists can more easily find a home on sites like 8chan. “Nobody was willing to be the official ISIS chatboard, but 8chan is willing to be that (for white supremacists), and that changes the entire texture of the effort to fight it,” he said in a phone interview. Officials at 8chan did not respond to requests for comment. But Kramer said Cloudflare treats all clients the same, citing far more banal content. “It’s stuff like cat photos and family reunion photos,” Kramer said, adding that Cloudflare does not believe its role is to monitor the legality and appropriateness of content on client sites. “If we do that, it gets messy really quickly.” One notable exception came in 2017 when Cloudflare stopped routing the traffic for neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer after the site falsely labeled the company as a secret supporter of the hate ideology. Cloudflare is private, but the company is interested in an initial public offering that could value it at more than $3.5 billion, Reuters reported in October, citing people familiar with the matter. Fidelity funds, including Contrafund, value their investment in Cloudflare at more than $100 million, according to disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Cloudflare said it has never provided law enforcement with a feed of customer content. However, should law enforcement contact the company about unlawful activity, it will provide information about the hosting provider, as needed, the company said in an email. Brittan Heller, a fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, said Cloudflare is in an awkward position dealing with clients that run hate sites. “Sometimes they have to hold their nose at the clients,” she said.

750,"UPDATE 2-Banco Santander Brasil's lending growth may slow, says CEO - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  11:23 AM / in 7 days","3 Min Read(Adds CEO, analysts comments) SAO PAULO, April 30 (Reuters) - Banco Santander Brasil SA’s aggressive pace of growth in lending may decelerate this year, as Chief Executive Sergio Rial said on Tuesday that demand for corporate loans has been weak and competition is likely to be fiercer. Rial told journalists he expects the bank’s extended loan book to reach around 400 billion reais ($101.5 billion) by December. “We will surpass 400 billion reais. If not, we will be close to 400 billion reais,” he said in a press conference. If Santander does not surpass this target, it would mean a loan book growth of roughly 3.5 percent in 2019, around one-third of the 11.2 percent growth posted in 2018. Santander Brasil’s loan book remained at 386.9 billion reais in the first quarter, stable from the previous quarter, although lending for consumers grew. The bank had been outpacing its competitors in previous quarters by extending loans to consumers shunned by other mainstream banks. However, Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil’s second largest lender, is closing the gap with Santander. Still, the bank beat analysts’ first-quarter profit estimates on Tuesday. Recurring net income at the Brazilian unit of Spain’s Banco Santander SA rose 21.9 percent to 3.485 billion reais and topped the 3.296 billion reais expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data, helped by lower loan-loss provisions. The bank’s return on equity remained stable at 21.1 percent. Units in Santander Brasil were down 2.27 percent in early afternoon trading. In a note to clients, Bradesco BBI’s analysts said that although results were good, Santander Brasil is trading at a higher price when compared to peers. Brazil made up 29 percent of the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value in the first quarter. Latin America’s importance has increased for Santander, as its businesses in the region have posted higher profitability growth, compensating for lower gains in Europe. Its 90-day delinquency rate also remained stable at 3.1 percent from the previous quarter. Chief Executive Sergio Rial, who also became the bank’s regional head for South America earlier this month, said he intends to boost the bank’s consumer finance business in the region at his new position. In Argentina, the bank will launch a consumer finance unit soon. Spain’s Santander reported earlier on Tuesday a net profit fall of 10 pct due to restructuring costs in Britain and Poland. $1 = 3.9407 reais

751,U.S. small business owners are preparing for a recession - Bank of America survey - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:43 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadApril 30 (Reuters) - Small business owners around the country are preparing for a recession, according to a new survey by Bank of America Corp, and the bank wants to put more business specialists in branches to help, an executive told Reuters. More than two-thirds of business owners surveyed by the bank said they had taken steps to prepare for an economic downturn, including setting cash aside or planning to reduce expenses. Of the 69 percent of owners who had started preparing for a recession, only 19 percent had opened a line of credit, a figure that Bank of America’s head of small business Sharon Miller said was too low. “When you need a line of credit, you often can’t get one,” she said in an interview. “Business owners should be thinking about that now.” There was less optimism about the U.S. economy than last year, the survey showed. Forty-eight percent of business owners felt the national economy would improve over the next year, down from 55 percent last fall. Concerns about healthcare costs and the impact of trade wars contributed to declining sentiment. The Charlotte-based bank was looking to grow its unit that caters to businesses with fewer than 100 employees and less than $5 million in revenue by putting small business specialists in each of Bank of America’s financial centers, Miller said. Bank of America currently employs about 2,300 business specialists and has about 4,300 branches. Earlier this month, the second-largest bank by assets announced plans to expand its branch and ATM network to cover more than 90 percent of the U.S. population by 2021.

752,European stocks end flat but gains for a fourth straight month - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:59 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares closed little changed on Tuesday as a decline in banks after disappointing earnings was countered by gains in oil stocks and a 21 percent surge in chipmaker AMS. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was flat at the close after oscillating between positive and negative territory throughout the day.  On the month, the STOXX 600 rose 3.2 percent, extending gains through a fourth straight month — its longest winning streak since May 2017. Rising oil prices and positive euro zone economic growth and employment data helped calm investor sentiment bruised by some poor earnings from regional companies, and weak factory data from China that cast a shadow over global growth.  “The stuff that matters the most for long term demand — the services, labor market — that in the euro zone is in good shape,” said Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg. On the day, London’s FTSE 100 underperformed, down 0.3 percent as miner Glencore weighed, while most other major country indices ended higher.  Banks were the biggest weight on the pan-regional index, with Danske Bank, caught up in a massive money laundering scandal, falling nearly 10 percent as it lowered its 2019 outlook after a disappointing first quarter. Banco Santander, the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, slipped after first-quarter net profit dropped.        Standard Chartered, however, advanced after it announced plans for up to $1 billion of share buybacks, the bank’s first in at least 20 years.  Data from China, a big consumer of metals, weighed on basic resources stocks, which were the biggest percentage losers. Glencore’s move to cut its copper output forecast also weighed on the sector. On the other hand, oil majors were the biggest boost to the region as crude prices rose.  Apple supplier AMS soared 21.2 percent, and posted its biggest one-day jump since October 2017 after it beat forecasts for first-quarter profit and gave an upbeat outlook for the second quarter. “It’s the good news of a strong outlook for second quarter sales versus expectations,” said Martin Moeller, a Swiss and Global Equity portfolio manager at UBP. “This comes after the bad news from Infineon and AMS in February ... Also, investors have been nervous about oversupply and high inventories in semiconductors, especially after the recent Intel forecast cut,” he said. AMS reported results before Apple’s quarterly report due late on Tuesday. Also helping the chip sentiment was an upbeat forecast from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for the second half of the year.

753,Investors cut Brazil pension reform savings expectations to 620 bln reais -survey - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:30 PM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadBRASILIA, April 30 (Reuters) - Investors have reduced the amount of expected savings over the next decade from Brazil’s social security reform to 620 billion reais ($157.8 billion) from 690 billion reais only two months ago, according to the average estimate in a Morgan Stanley client poll. While 95 percent of the more than 125 respondents expect Congress to eventually pass pension reform legislation, the bill’s slow and complicated journey in recent weeks has forced investors to lower their expectations. Savings of 620 billion reais would be a “more reasonable” expectation, Morgan Stanley said. But that would represent only half the upwardly revised 1.237 trillion reais target announced earlier this month by the government. The latest average estimate is 10 percent down from Morgan Stanley’s previous client survey in February, and masks some remarkable opinion shifts in just two months. Forty-two percent of respondents now expect savings of 600 billion reais or less, more than double the 20 percent from February, while the percentage of respondents predicting 500 billion reais or less tripled to 12 percent from 4 percent. The share of those expecting savings of 700 billion to 800 billion reais almost halved to 16 percent from 29 percent in February, and the share of investors expecting more than 800 billion reais fell to 11 percent from 18 percent, the poll showed. The big increase was in the 500 billion to 600 billion reais savings bracket. Some 30 percent of those polled now expect this level of savings, almost double the 16 percent in February. Investors overwhelmingly expect the lower house to approve pension reform in the second half of this year. Only 5 percent of those polled expect Lower House approval before the end of June, the target that senior lawmakers and government officials, from President Jair Bolsonaro down, are still sticking to. Thirty percent of those surveyed say it will be August, 23 percent say September, and 20 percent say July. In the last poll, 39 percent of investors expected a Lower House vote in the first half of the year, probably June. The survey also showed that investors’ bullishness on the real has faded. Clients see the real strengthening only a little by the end of the year to 3.85 per dollar from just under 4.00 currently, rather than 3.60 in the previous survey.

754,UPDATE 2-Bank of Canada chief sees economy starting to shrug off headwinds later this year - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  3:38 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds comments by Bank of Canada governor, details, background) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, April 30 (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on Tuesday said that while the Canadian economy currently faced some headwinds, there was good reason to believe growth would accelerate in the second half of this year. Poloz, speaking to the House of Commons finance committee, reiterated that he felt an accommodative policy on interest rates was still warranted. Last week, the central bank made clear rate hikes were off the table for now, given the economy was struggling to cope with lower oil prices, weak household spending and the impact of global trade conflicts. It also cut its estimate for annualized first-quarter growth to just 0.3 percent. “The Canadian economy is currently facing some headwinds, but there is good reason to believe that the economy will accelerate in the second half of this year,” said Poloz. “We will continue to evaluate the appropriate degree of monetary policy accommodation as new data arrive. In particular, we are monitoring developments in household spending, oil markets and global trade policy.” The Bank of Canada said it wants rates to eventually rise to its so-called neutral range, when monetary policy neither stimulates nor restrains growth. Last week the bank revised down its estimate for the neutral range to 2.25 percent to 3.25 percent, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, citing additional information and improved modeling. Poloz told the committee that the move - which largely reflected global trends such as slowing labor force growth and lower productivity - should not be regarded as permanent. “Only if we did have a long-lasting rise in productivity would there be pressure for it to rise up ... that, of course, is quite possible,” he said.

755,Investors most upbeat on U.S. Treasuries since mid-2016: survey - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  2:49 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond investors are the most bullish about owning U.S. longer-dated government debt than at anytime since June 2016, prompted by signs of mild inflation despite a solid labor market and steady economic growth, a J.P. Morgan survey showed on Tuesday. The U.S. economy grew 3.2% in the first three months of 2019, much stronger than analysts forecast thanks to a jump in inventory and exports that is expected to fade in the coming months, the government said on Friday. Moreover, the core rate of personal consumption expenditure, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, grew by 1.7% in the last quarter on a year-over-year basis, slower than the 1.9% pace in the previous quarter. This economic snapshot supported the notion the Federal Reserve may consider leaving interest rates unchanged in 2019 and perhaps beyond until inflation accelerates, analysts said. Tame inflation and the dovish turn by the Fed earlier this year have increased the appeal of holding longer-dated Treasuries, they said.  The share of investors who said they were “long” or held more longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks exceeded those investors who said they were “short” or held fewer longer-term government debt issues than their benchmarks by 17 percentage points on Monday, up from 4 percentage points the week before, J.P. Morgan said. In midday Tuesday trading, the yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were 2.5144%, down from a four-week peak at 2.6140% reached two weeks earlier.

756,Kingsbury on No. 1 pick: 'Everything's on the table' - Reuters,"March 24, 2019 /  4:44 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadIf first-year coach Kliff Kingsbury knows who his Arizona Cardinals will select next month with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, he isn’t letting on. In an interview with NFL Media this weekend, Kingsbury said the team hasn’t made a decision. “I think everything’s on the table,” he said. “When you have that first pick, you’ve gotta turn over every stone and look at every scenario that’s out there, and so we’re definitely doing that.” One frequently mentioned possibility is that the Cardinals - who selected quarterback Josh Rosen with the No. 10 overall pick in 2018 - will choose Kyler Murray, the Heisman Trophy-winner from Oklahoma and trade Rosen. But Arizona, which finished an NFL-worst 3-13 last season, has a number of needs on both sides of the ball. The Cardinals scored a league-low 225 points while surrendering 425. “We haven’t (decided),” Kingsbury said. “We haven’t. We’re a long ways from that. You know, coaches on the road, scouts from the road, private workouts, pro days. And we won’t even discuss until next week and try to fill our board and go from there.” The Cardinals’ brass met with Murray in Oklahoma last week. At the same time, Kingsbury said he is high on Rosen, calling him a “tremendous talent.” A former QB himself, Kingsbury said he has communicated that opinion to Rosen and also talked about the draft. “Yeah, I’ve talked to Josh and he understands it’s a business and what all goes with the first pick and what’s going on,” Kingsbury said. Trading the pick isn’t out of the question.

Katie Campbell added 15 points, making 5 of 6 3-point attempts, for the Bulldogs (29-4), who scored the game’s first 16 points. Gonzaga will play either host Oregon State or Boise State in the second round Monday. Tori Lasker led Arkansas Little Rock (21-11) with 16 points on 6-for-11 shooting. Terrion Moore added 13 points and a team-high four assists. The Bulldogs played without two key players, point guard Laura Stockton and top reserve Jill Townsend, who both suffered season-ending leg injuries in the West Coast Conference tournament semifinals. Stockton, the daughter of Gonzaga legend and Basketball Hall of Famer John Stockton, averaged 8.9 points and 4.2 assists per game. Townsend was second on the team with 9.4 points per game and also averaged 4.7 rebounds. Their absence wasn’t felt in the first quarter, as the Bulldogs raced to a 21-2 lead. Arkansas Little Rock missed its first 13 shots and didn’t score until Ronjanae DeGray made a putback with 3:05 left in the quarter. The Trojans finished the quarter with seven turnovers and zero assists. The Trojans did their best to rally in the second quarter, making 6 of 10 field-goal attempts to cut the deficit to as few as nine points. Campbell made a 3-pointer with 49 seconds left to give the Bulldogs a 32-20 halftime lead. Arkansas Little Rock again got within nine points in the third quarter, but couldn’t get any closer. Gonzaga took a 49-38 lead into the fourth, and the Trojans weren’t able to cut the deficit to single digits in the final 10 minutes.

758,"Attorney general pores over Russia report, details may come Sunday - Reuters","March 23, 2019 /  4:12 AM / a month ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON/WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr pored over a special counsel report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow, and was due to release key findings perhaps as early as Sunday. Barr, the top U.S. law enforcement official, aimed to transmit to Congress and the public a summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report by the end of the weekend.  He will not deliver the summary on Saturday, a Justice Department official said, leaving it likely that he will do so on Sunday.     There appeared to be initial good news for President Donald Trump and his inner circle, as Mueller did not bring any new indictments when handing over his report to Barr on Friday after a probe of almost two years. That signals there might be no more criminal charges against Trump associates on the issue of whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to help ensure the Republican businessman’s surprise election win against Democrat Hillary Clinton. “Once we get the principal conclusions of the report, it’s entirely possible that that’ll be a good day for the president and his core supporters,” Democratic Senator Chris Coon told reporters on a conference call. It was not immediately known what Mueller’s report says about another strand of inquiry: whether Trump committed obstruction of justice to hinder the Russia investigation by acts such as firing then FBI Director James Comey in 2017.         Mueller had earlier brought charges against 34 people and three companies, with prison sentences for some of Trump’s  ex-aides such as former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.  None of those charges, however, directly related to the question of collusion between the campaign and Moscow. Trump and his core team still face legal risks even if the report does not find that they committed crimes, and congressional Democrats on Saturday vowed to keep looking into his activities.    Trump’s business, his charity and presidential transition operation remain under investigation, said Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Other prosecutors have picked up strands of the Mueller probe, most notably the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York which is looking into Trump’s business practices and financial dealings.                    On Saturday, Barr and his deputy were working closely with principal advisers to determine what to include in a letter to Congress to present the key findings of Mueller’s report.           Under Department of Justice regulations, Barr is empowered to decide how much to disclose publicly. A Trump appointee, Barr told lawmakers on Friday that he is “committed to as much transparency as possible.”                    The attorney general spent nine hours at the Justice Department on Saturday before leaving at around 7 p.m. (2300 GMT), CNN said. Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, resort for the weekend, remained uncharacteristically silent about the completion of the investigation that has cast a shadow over his two years in the White House.  He has frequently derided the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.” He denies collaborating with Moscow. Russia says it did not interfere in the election. Spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters that the White House still has not received or been briefed on Mueller’s report.         The president had no public events scheduled on Saturday and played golf with musician Kid Rock. “He’s fine,” Gidley said when asked by reporters how Trump was feeling. “He’s good, he’s good.” Gidley declined to say whether Trump had talked about the Mueller report while golfing. A large pro-Trump float behind a flatbed truck pulled up to the golf course about an hour after he arrived, adorned with American flags and “Trump 2020” signs. Political analysts expect the Mueller report to have a significant impact on the 2020 presidential campaign - how Democrats might be able to use it stop Trump being reelected and how Trump could use it if he is effectively cleared of wrongdoing. The big question is whether the report contains allegations against Trump or exonerates him. Even if Mueller has outlined serious wrongdoing by Trump, the Justice Department has a policy that sitting presidents cannot face criminal charges. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election with a campaign of email hacking and online propaganda aimed at sowing discord in the United States, hurting Clinton and helping Trump.         U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said Barr’s offer to provide congressional committees with a summary of the report’s conclusions is insufficient and that “Congress requires the full report and the underlying documents.”    House Democrats have sent letters to the Justice Department to ensure Mueller report documents are preserved in case lawmakers need to see them, Representative Ted Lieu told MSNBC.

The share of investors who said they are “long” or hold more longer-dated Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks exceeded those investors who said they are “short” or hold fewer longer-term government debt issues than their benchmarks by 17 percentage points, up from 4 percentage points the week before, J.P.

762,UPDATE 1-Brazil primary budget deficit narrows more than expected in March - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  2:38 PM / in 7 days","3 Min Read(Adds detail, context) By Jamie McGeever and Marcela Ayres BRASILIA, April 30 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government’s primary deficit narrowed more than expected in March, but in nominal terms rose as a share of gross domestic product over the year, the central bank said on Tuesday. The primary deficit, comprising the central government, regional governments and state-owned enterprises before interest payments are factored in, narrowed to 18.6 billion reais ($4.73 billion) in March from 25.1 billion reais in March last year. That was also less than the median deficit of 21.5 billion reais forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, but was still the second biggest shortfall for the month of March since the data series began in 2001. With the public finances under severe strain, Brazil’s government is trying to push through an ambitious overhaul of the social security system, which it hopes will save over 1 trillion reais over the next decade. On Monday, the Treasury officially recognized that budget constraints and weak revenues would see public investment grind to a virtual standstill this year, potentially to a new record low below 0.5 percent of GDP. The central bank’s figures on Tuesday showed that the central government - comprising the federal government, central bank and social security system - posted a primary deficit of 20.4 billion reais in March, while states and municipalities registered a surplus of 1.74 billion reais. The accumulated primary deficit over the 12 months to March reached 99.3 billion reais, or 1.43 percent of GDP. The end-2019 target is for a deficit of around 132 billion reais. In nominal terms, once interest payments are included, Brazil’s deficit was 62.2 billion reais in March. That brought the accumulated total over 12 months to 483.8 billion reais, or 6.98 percent of GDP, up from 6.95 percent the month before, the central bank said. Public sector net debt last month was 3.755 trillion reais, down 0.3 percentage point to 54.2 percent of GDP, while gross debt rose to 5.431 trillion reais. That marked an increase of 0.9 percentage point to 78.4 percent of GDP. $1 = 3.9340 reais

763,US STOCKS-Wall Street pauses after record run as Alphabet tumbles - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  2:33 PM / 7 days ago","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Alphabet on track for worst day in 7 yrs on revenue miss * Merck, Pfizer rise after earnings beat, help Dow * GE jumps as Q1 profit rises, cash outflow slows * FOMC set for two-day meeting * Indexes down: Dow 0.10%, S&P 0.29%, Nasdaq 0.67% (Updates to open) By Shreyashi   Sanyal and Sruthi Shankar April 30 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s main indexes on Tuesday pulled away from all-time highs set in the previous session, following a slump in the shares of Google-parent Alphabet after weak quarterly results. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke above record levels on Monday as investors took comfort from a largely positive earnings season, benign inflation data and hints of progress in the U.S.-China trade talks. Impeding the recent run up in stocks, Alphabet Inc shares fell 7.6%, on track for their worst decline since January 2012, after the company posted its slowest revenue growth in three years. The S&P communication services sector slid 2.35%, the most among major S&P sectors and was on track for its biggest percentage fall in over four months. Apple Inc dropped 2% ahead of results later in the day, which will wrap up earnings for the high-growth FAANG stocks. “Markets are at all-time highs. I think investors are starting to question what’s going to take us higher and with numbers like Google, it isn’t something that would excite average investors right now,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Helping cap losses on the Dow, Chevron Corp jumped 3.2%. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc put $10 billion behind Occidental Petroleum Corp’s bid as it tries to see off competition from Chevron to buy smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. In a big day for healthcare earnings, Pfizer Inc rose 1.4% and Merck & Co Inc climbed 0.7% after both the drugmakers reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. With earnings in full swing, analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to drop 0.2% in the first quarter, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. General Electric Co jumped 4.4% after the industrial conglomerate’s first-quarter profit rose and it lost less cash than expected. The energy sector rose 0.41% tracking gains in oil prices which topped $73 on Tuesday, as Venezuela’s opposition leader called on the military to back him to end Nicolas Maduro’s rule and Saudi Arabia said a deal between producers to curb output could be extended to the end of 2019. Mastercard Inc rose 2.85% after the card company beat Wall Street’s estimates for quarterly profit. At 10:02 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.82 points, or 0.10%, at 26,527.57, the S&P 500 was down 8.53 points, or 0.29%, at 2,934.50 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 54.86 points, or 0.67%, at 8,106.99. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. Also on the radar was the Fed which kicks off a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.11-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 44 new highs and 14 new lows.

766,German inflation exceeds ECB target on 'Easter bunny' bounce - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  9:39 AM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - German annual inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent in April, exceeding the European Central Bank’s target for the first time since November, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting little need for further monetary easing.  Consumer prices, harmonized to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.1 percent year-on-year after an increase of 1.4 percent in the previous month, preliminary data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. That compared with the consensus forecast for a 1.7 percent rise and was above the ECB’s target of close to but just below 2 percent for the euro zone as a whole. Euro zone stocks and German bond yields rose after the data. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said on Twitter: “Is #hyperinflation back? 2.1 percent in April! No, the Easter bunny is to blame.” He pointed to the cost of package holidays going up, with Easter falling later this year than last, and higher fuel prices. “We will see a drop back clearly below 2 percent in May and then a lot obviously will depend on energy prices,” he told Reuters. With growth slowing and inflation expected to decline later in the year, the ECB already announced more support measures, such as a new round of ultra cheap bank loans, hoping this would boost growth by maintaining the flow of credit to the real economy.  But the German inflation rise and a stronger-than-expected euro zone growth figure suggest there is no reason for the ECB to offer more support, such as a tiered deposit rate, which would shield some banks from the side effects of negative rates, Brzeski said. “There clearly is no case for further easing,” he said. ECB board member Benoit Coeure said last week that he saw no reason to create a tiered deposit rate that exempts banks from part of an ECB charge on their idle cash. Inflation in the euro zone has long been below the ECB’s target and ECB rate-setter Olli Rehn said on Friday that investors may be doubting the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures in boosting inflation. Despite the ECB pursuing an accommodative monetary policy, inflation is not expected to hit the central bank’s target for years to come. A breakdown of non-harmonized national data showed the price of energy rose by 4.6 percent in April while the cost of services and goods also increased. Economists expect annual euro zone inflation - due to be published on May 3 - to accelerate to 1.6 percent in April from 1.4 percent in March.

Verallia also reported on Tuesday higher first quarter results. Revenues rose 6.7 percent to 633 million euros ($710 million) while its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 18.8 percent to 142 million euros.

768,"Trump sues Deutsche Bank, Capital One to try to block Democratic subpoenas - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  2:03 PM / in 7 days","4 Min ReadApril 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization have sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp to try to block them from responding to subpoenas issued by U.S. congressional Democrats seeking financial records. The lawsuit represents a new front in Trump’s battle with the Democratic-led House of Representatives to impede investigations of the Republican president, his family, his businesses and his administration following Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. In a complaint filed on Monday night in federal court in Manhattan, Trump and his family accused House committee leaders of pursuing the records for no legitimate or lawful purpose. Only the banks were named as defendants. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the complaint said. The lawsuit also accused Democratic leaders of hoping to “stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, according to media reports. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. Deutsche Bank said in a statement, “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Capital One was not immediately available for comment. On April 15, two House committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has said he intends to defy efforts by congressional Democrats to look into his affairs, including possible dealings with Russia. The complaint by Trump, his adult children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, and the Trump Organization said House leaders ignored constitutional limits on Congress’ power to investigate, and any probe needed to further some “legitimate legislative purpose” and could not be an end in itself. It also said the subpoenas violated the plaintiffs’ privacy rights, and the refusal of House committees to even provide copies of the subpoenas to the plaintiffs made it impossible to know, or negotiate, their scope or breadth. The plaintiffs said Deutsche Bank confirmed that the subpoenas it received sought financial information for their “parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, divisions, partnerships, properties, groups, special purpose entities, joint ventures, predecessors, successors or any other entity in which they have or had a controlling interest.” Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment. Mueller’s report detailed extensive contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russia and described the campaign’s expectation of benefiting from Moscow’s actions, but did not conclude there was a criminal conspiracy.

769,Factbox: Smoke or fire? Contacts between Trump campaign and Russia - Reuters,"March 22, 2019 /  9:59 PM / a month ago","6 Min Read(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other U.S. prosecutors have been investigating whether President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign conspired with Russia. Trump and Moscow have denied any collusion.  Mueller handed in the keenly awaited report on his probe, the Justice Department said on Friday. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the presidential election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and damage the Republican Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Russia denies it. Here are some key interactions between Trump advisors and Russian figures that have been unearthed by Mueller’s probe and investigations in Congress. Several top Trump aides, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr., met in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer who had offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. prosecutors said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was an agent for the Kremlin. The meeting was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist. Participants in the meeting said nothing improper occurred and that Veselnitskaya discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia and adoption policy, not election issues. The president said he did not know about the meeting beforehand. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he pursued a deal to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow until June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen said in a guilty plea that he spoke with an assistant to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary in January of that year and briefed Trump on the project more than three times. Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the Moscow skyscraper talks continued until Trump won the November 2016 election but later said he misspoke.  Trump, who repeatedly said during the campaign that he had no contacts with Russia, said after Cohen’s guilty plea in November 2018 there was nothing wrong with pursuing the deal. Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos worked between March 2016 and August 2016 to set up a meeting with Russian leadership, according to prosecutors. They said a London-based professor with ties to the Russian government told him in April 2016 that Moscow had compromising information on Clinton. Papadopoulos served 14 days in prison after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about those efforts. Manafort shared election campaign polling data in August 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner who Mueller has described as having ties to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by Manafort’s lawyers. The two also discussed a plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, a major Kremlin foreign policy goal as it seeks relief from U.S. economic sanctions, according to court filings.  Manafort, a veteran Republican political consultant who earned million of dollars working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, also offered private briefings about the campaign to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin, in an effort to collect past debts, according to the Washington Post. Roger Stone, a veteran Republican political consultant who has worked on and off with Trump for decades, shared with Trump campaign officials advance knowledge he had of a plan by the WikiLeaks website to release emails stolen from the Clinton campaign by Russians, prosecutors said. The charging document mentions that a senior Trump campaign official “was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information” WikiLeaks had about the Clinton campaign, raising the possibility Trump himself made the request. Stone pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and witness tampering.  Several Trump advisers met with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump became president.  They included: Michael Flynn, who served as Trump’s first White House national security advisor. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Kislyak in December 2017, after Trump won the election but before he took office. During those calls, according to the indictment, Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia and asked Kislyak to help delay a U.N. vote seen as damaging to Israel, a move that ran counter to the policies of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Jeff Sessions, a Republican U.S. senator serving as a campaign adviser who Trump later named attorney general, said he met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016 after initially telling Congress he was unaware of any communications between the campaign and Russia. As attorney general, Sessions recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, drawing the ire of Trump. The recusal by Sessions left Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, with oversight over the probe, which at the time was headed by the FBI. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to take over the probe. Kushner said he asked Kislyak if he could set up a secure communications channel at the Russian Embassy after Trump won the election. Kushner also said he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, during that period at Kislyak’s insistence. Vnesheconombank has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014. Compiled by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

770,Factbox: Who did not face charges in Mueller's probe? - Reuters,"March 23, 2019 /  1:35 AM / a month ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Friday appeared to end his probe without bringing criminal charges against several individuals he had investigated, including advisers and family members of President Donald Trump accused by Democratic lawmakers of not fully disclosing contacts with Russians. Mueller handed in a confidential report on his investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who will decide how much of it to make public. Mueller’s two-year investigation led to criminal charges against 34 individuals in total, including six of Trump’s associates and several Russian nationals. He did not recommend any further indictments, a senior Justice Department official said.  Trump has repeatedly called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt” and denies any collusion with Russia. Russia denies interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Following are some individuals who came under scrutiny during the investigation but appear to have avoided criminal charges. Trump’s eldest son met in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer to hear what he hoped was damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “If it’s what you say I love it,” he wrote to Rob Goldstone, a British publicist who arranged the meeting.  U.S. prosecutors said the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was an agent for the Kremlin.  When the meeting became public in June 2017, Trump Jr. initially said the meeting was about U.S. sanctions on Russia, not the presidential election.  Trump Jr. also communicated during the campaign with WikiLeaks, the website that released stolen emails from the Clinton campaign.  President Trump’s son-in-law played a central role in the 2016 election and now serves as a senior White House adviser.  Kushner also attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. He said he arrived late and tried to leave early after concluding the meeting was a “waste of time.” In December 2016, after Trump won the election, Kushner asked Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to set up a secure communications channel at the Russian embassy. He also met that month with Sergei Gorkov, a Russian espionage officer who heads Vneshconombank, a Russian state-owned bank that is under U.S. sanctions. Kushner said no specific policies were discussed, nor was there any discussion about U.S. sanctions on Russia. Trump’s first attorney general told Congress he was unaware of any communications between the campaign and Russia, before admitting that he met with Kislyak at least twice during the campaign. That led Sessions, a former Republican senator, to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, drawing the ire of Trump. Sessions also told Congress that during the campaign he resisted a proposal by then-foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulous to meet with Russian officials. But three people who were in the room for the discussion told Reuters that Sessions expressed no objections to the idea. All three have given their version of events to FBI agents or congressional investigators. Mueller was investigating Deripaska, a Russian metals magnate, because of his close ties to the Kremlin and his relationship with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who has been sentenced to 7-1/2 years in prison for witness tampering, tax and bank fraud, and other crimes. Manafort offered to share information about the campaign with Deripaska, a major lobbying client, but there was no evidence Deripaska ever accepted the offer.  The U.S. Treasury Department hit Deripaska’s businesses with economic sanctions in April 2018, alleging he was profiting from his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and from the country’s “malign activity” around the world. Deripaska sued the U.S. government earlier this month, alleging it unfairly accused him of involvement in Russian government activities. Corsi, a right-wing political commentator and conspiracy theorist, came under scrutiny because longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone sought to use him as an intermediary to communicate with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the election. Corsi said in November that he had received an offer from Mueller’s office to plead guilty to one felony count of providing false information to them in return for a lighter sentence. He said he rejected the deal because he never intentionally lied during his 40 hours of interviews with Mueller’s team. A foreign-policy adviser during the campaign, Page drew scrutiny from the FBI, which said in legal filings in 2016 that it believed he had been “collaborating and conspiring” with the Kremlin. Page met with several Russian government officials during a trip to Moscow in July 2016 and said he kept campaign officials up to date about his activities there.

773,MONEY MARKETS-Rise in key U.S. rate stokes talk of Fed move - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:58 PM / in 7 days","3 Min Read(Adds background, quote, graphic) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, April 30 (Reuters) - The continued rise of a key U.S. interest rate that the Federal Reserve targets is fanning speculation the U.S. central bank will make another tweak to a monetary policy tool this week to prevent the rate from climbing further. It has also stoked talk the Fed would launch a program, referred to as a standing repo facility, to pump more cash into the banking system. The effective, or average, federal funds rate rose to 2.45% on Monday from 2.44% on Friday, New York Federal Reserve data released on Tuesday showed. The fed funds rate is the overnight borrowing cost for U.S. banks to borrow excess reserves and is the basis for other short-term bank borrowing costs. This rate’s premium over the interest rate the U.S. central bank pays on the excess reserves that banks leave with it (IOER) reached a record 5 basis points on Monday. Some analysts expect that Fed policymakers may reduce the IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35% at their two-day meeting that will begin later Tuesday. “Even though this is meant to be a technical adjustment, the Fed will be aware that such a cut in the present environment would have some symbolic significance,” Citi analysts wrote in a research note released on Tuesday. The Fed made technical adjustments to the IOER twice last year in a bid to encourage banks to lend their reserves rather than leave them at the Fed. There have been concerns that the fed funds rate might break above the top end of the Fed’s target range, currently at 2.50%. If this were to occur, it may disrupt money markets and shake investor confidence in the Fed’s ability to control short-term interest rates. The spike in the fed funds rate in recent days likely stems from less cash in the banking system due to annual tax payments to the federal government, Citi analysts said. If the Fed does not reduce the IOER this week, it may offer guidance on the introduction of a standing repo facility to curb money market volatility during bank reporting periods when demand for reserves jumps, analysts said. “The medium-term solution, which we believe is coming over the next few months, is another standing repo facility, which is likely to reduce volatility in money market rates around month, quarter and year-end and narrow the spread between short-term Treasuries and OIS, all else equal,” Standard Chartered Bank economist Sonia Meskin wrote in a note on Tuesday.

775,"UPDATE 2-Hungary leaves rates unchanged, defying higher prices - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  12:04 PM / in 7 days","3 Min Read(Updates with policy statement, market reaction, analyst comments) * Base rate 0.9 pct, overnight depo rate -0.05 pct * In line with unanimous analyst forecasts * Spate of strong econ data since March meeting * Bank reiterates accommodative policy stance * Bank may act in June if CPI rises further -analyst By Gergely Szakacs and Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 30 (Reuters) - The National Bank of Hungary left interest rates unchanged and reiterated its accommodative policy stance on Tuesday although economists project a slow increase in official rates this year and next because of strong domestic inflation. The bank left its base rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent, in line with the unanimous forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll last week. “The outlook for world economic activity and inflation continues to be moderate,” the rate-setting Monetary Council said in a post-meeting statement. “Monetary policies across the world’s leading central banks remain cautious.” “The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative,” it added, sticking to its dovish language despite some analysts saying that approach could put pressure on the forint with inflation running at a more than six-year-high. At 1316 GMT, the forint traded at 323.48 versus the euro, down from 323 per euro before the rate decision. The currency is trading near three-and-a-half-month lows, weakening since the bank’s March policy meeting. At that meeting, the bank raised its overnight deposit rate by 10 basis points, halting nearly seven years of monetary easing, after inflation rose to near the top of its 2-4 percent target range. But it said the move was a one-off, rather than the start of a cycle, since a global economic slowdown could curb inflation. It also said any policy change would hinge on its quarterly inflation reports. The next is due in June. “Given that the statement did not contain any reference to further monetary tightening in the near term in response to strong inflationary pressure, the forint started to weaken following the publication,” analysts at brokerage Equilor said. Data published since the bank’s March policy meeting showed continued strength in domestic price pressures. March core inflation rose to 3.8 percent, the highest since December 2012. February gross wages increased by 12.1 percent, while retail sales grew by 8.4 percent from a year ago. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the overnight deposit rate to rise to 0.1 percent by the end of 2019. The base rate is forecast to remain unchanged but rise to 1.25 percent next year and 1.55 percent by the end of 2021. “Should inflation increase further in the coming months, parallel with the publication of its updated (economic) forecasts, the central bank may announce further (policy) normalisation steps in June,” analysts at CIB Bank said.

780,Italian bank fund could take Carige stake in BlackRock rescue: Intesa CEO - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  12:03 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadTURIN, Italy (Reuters) - A rescue plan for Italy’s Carige by U.S. asset manager BlackRock would allow a fund financed by Italian lenders to take part in a cash call at the Genoa-based bank, the chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo said on Tuesday. Carlo Messina said the BlackRock proposal was consistent with a restructuring plan drafted by Carige’s temporary administrators which allowed the Italian banking fund to take a stake by converting debt into equity. Italian banks propped up Carige in November by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond to beef up its total capital via the voluntary-contribution arm of a depositor guarantee fund.  Messina told shareholders that Intesa indirectly held 25.3 percent of that bond through the fund. “It appears the deal proposed by BlackRock is in line with the relaunch plan drawn up by the bank’s commissioners,” Messina said at Intesa’s annual general meeting. The European Central Bank (ECB) appointed temporary administrators to run Carige at the start of the year after the top shareholder in Italy’s 10th-largest bank in December blocked a 400 million euro cash call. The cash call was part of an industry-financed rescue that would have seen lenders convert the 320 million euro bond. The commissioners are now looking for a buyer to fill a capital shortfall which has swelled to 630 million euros. However, sources have said the BlackRock plan may envisage an even bigger cash call to build up a capital buffer. The ECB has extended until mid-May a bid deadline to give more time to BlackRock, the only known potential buyer through one of its funds specializing in restructuring.

782,Citizenship question on U.S. Census would cause Hispanic undercount by millions: study - Reuters,"March 22, 2019 /  5:58 PM / a month ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s proposal to ask a citizenship question on the 2020 U.S. census could lead to an undercount of some 4.2 million among Hispanics, costing their communities federal aid and political representation, according to a new study by Harvard researchers. The study by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy is the first to assess the impact of the proposed question since U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced plans last year to reinstate it for the first time in more than half a century. The study found the question could lead to census-takers missing between 3.9 million and 4.6 million Hispanics nationwide - or between 7.7 percent and 9.1 percent of the Hispanic population recorded in the last U.S. census, in 2010.  Demographers, data experts and even Census Bureau officials have said the question risks frightening immigrants into abstaining from the count in a climate of stepped-up immigration enforcement. Because decennial census data determines how congressional seats are apportioned - and how the U.S. government allocates $800 billion a year in federal aid - an undercount could prove disastrous in some communities. Harvard said it surveyed some 9,000 people, about half of whom were Hispanic. Researchers found the citizenship question would make all respondents - but especially Hispanics - more likely to skip key questions about race and ethnicity, and less likely to report Hispanic members of their households. The study may have undersold the impact of the question, the researchers said. “Not only are we university affiliated academic researchers, and not the U.S. Government... but our respondents were paid panelists and thus financially incentivized to complete the survey,” they said. The U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment.     Michael Cook, a spokesman for the Census Bureau, said in a statement to Reuters that the bureau is planning to spend $500 million to market the census and promote participation. Cook called the campaign “the most robust marketing and outreach effort in Census history.” Although a citizenship question has routinely appeared on some Census Bureau surveys, it has not appeared on the mandatory, decennial U.S. census since 1950. Ross says it is needed to help the U.S. Department of Justice better enforce federal protections for minority voters. Two federal judges have blocked the question for now, siding with Democratic states and cities that alleged Ross’ reasoning was a pretext to repress immigrant participation. The U.S. Supreme Court is slated to hear an appeal on April 23.  The Census, estimated to cost taxpayers $16 billion, becomes more expensive when fewer people respond, as the bureau must pay door-knockers to follow up with noncompliant households.  Ross has come under fire for not testing the citizenship question itself. The Census Bureau is planning to survey the effects of the question in July, to better understand operational needs “such as how many census takers may be needed to follow up and where they should be located,” Cook said.

Moore, who described himself as a “growth hawk” and an “independent voice” in an interview on Bloomberg Television, said the Fed made a “very substantial mistake” in December by hiking interest rates and that they have, “thank God, reversed that and changed directions.” “I’m not sure about that,” said Moore, asked whether the Fed should cut rates. “One of the things that will be really interesting for me is to hear the case, look at their data and then help make the decision about whether we’re too tight or too loose.” Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Chizu NomiyamaAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

785,Germany's Merkel rejects speculation about early exit - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  2:53 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadBERLIN, April 30 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel denied speculation on Tuesday that she would resign before the end of her term in 2021, quashing media reports suggesting she would announce her intentions at a conservative party meeting in June. Merkel, widely seen as an anchor of stability in Europe for the last 14 years, handed over the leadership of her Christian Democrats (CDU) in December in response to growing criticism of her handling of the migrant crisis and its consequences. Although she wants to remain chancellor until the 2021 national election, speculation is rife that she may go sooner. So far Merkel, 64, has choreographed a gradual exit with her protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, elected CDU chief. Asked at a news conference whether she planned to make any announcement about her future at a June 2-3 party meeting, Merkel said she would “answer that with a clear no”. The latest media speculation was triggered by the sudden announcement of the CDU meeting, due to take place just days after European Parliament elections in which the conservatives are expected to remain the biggest party. The CDU has said the meeting would address how the work of the coalition between the conservatives and Social Democrats (SPD) needed to adapt to new tax estimates, expected to be lower than previous forecasts, which will be available by then. While relations between Merkel and Kramp-Karrenbauer, dubbed “mini-Merkel”, are good, the new CDU leader is trying to make her own mark by holding workshops on policies, including the hot topic of  migration. She has also tried to appeal to the traditional values of some more conservative voters. Four German states also hold elections this year, including three in the formerly communist east of the country.

786,"KKR, GIC betting on India's power sector with $400 million investment: sources - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:53 AM / in 7 days","4 Min ReadHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global investment firm KKR & Co Inc is leading a deal to acquire a controlling stake in India Grid Trust (IndiGrid), in a bet on the country’s rapidly growing power sector, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters. KKR, together with Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, will acquire up to 57 percent of IndiGrid for about $400 million, the people said. IndiGrid’s current market value is about $332 million. The deal would mark KKR’s first infrastructure investment in Asia since it set up a team late last year that focuses on the sector in the region.  The pair will invest 20.64 billion rupees ($295 million) for a 42 percent stake in the trust via a preference equity issuance, the people said. KKR, having applied to become sponsor of IndiGrid, will then acquire a 15 percent stake from its current sponsor, Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd, pending regulatory approval. The infrastructure investment trust, the first of its kind in India, will separately raise around 4.5 billion rupees ($64.6 million) from other investors including Sterlite Power as part of the equity issue, the people said, declining to be named as the information is confidential.     GIC is contributing $140 million to the deal while KKR is investing the rest from its own balance sheet, according to the people. KKR declined to provide comment for the story. GIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India Grid Trust and Sterlite Power Grid Ventures were not available for comment. India’s power demand grew at about 3.6 percent in 2018/19, lagging overall economic growth. However the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases aims to double its clean energy capacity to 40 percent of total power capacity by 2030, requiring new grid infrastructure, most of which is expected to be funded by foreign money. The energy-hungry nation will launch $5 billion of transmission line tenders, beginning in June, to deliver 175 gigawatts of power from renewable sources by 2022, government officials told Reuters last month.  Sterlite Power, a major private transmission developer, created IndiGrid in 2016 to run its asset operations. The trust raised $350 million in an initial public offering a year later. IndiGrid owns five assets developed by Sterlite and one from a third party and 13 transmission lines. With the capital injection, it plans to acquire five more electricity transmission assets worth 115 billion rupees from Sterlite Power, which will more than triple its assets under management to 170 billion rupees, according to the people. KKR will separately acquire a majority stake in Sterlite Investment Managers Ltd, IndiGrid’s investment manager, from  Sterlite Power, they said. KKR hired David Luboff, former chief executive of Macquarie Group’s Asia Infrastructure Fund, as its head of Asia Pacific Infrastructure from the beginning of this year.  It is considering launching an Asia-focused infrastructure fund which could be as large as $1.5 billion, Reuters has reported.

787,Why an unbuilt Moscow Trump tower caught Mueller's attention - Reuters,"March 18, 2019 /  11:05 AM / a month ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - An intriguing area of focus in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Kremlin’s role in the 2016 U.S. election is a proposed Moscow real estate deal that Donald Trump pursued while running for president despite denying at the time any links to Russia. The special counsel has revealed in court filings numerous details about the project, which never came to fruition. Further information has come from Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer who was instrumental in the negotiations, in congressional testimony and in his guilty plea to a charge of lying to Congress about the project. Mueller’s team said in a December 2018 court filing that “the Moscow Project was a lucrative business opportunity that sought, and likely required, the assistance of the Russian government. If the project was completed, the Company (the Trump Organization) could have received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian sources in licensing fees and other revenues.” The project is significant because it shows Trump was chasing a lucrative business deal in Russia at the same time that President Vladimir Putin’s government, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, was conducting a hacking and propaganda campaign to boost his candidacy. The project also coincided with Trump’s positive comments as a candidate about Putin and his questioning of U.S. sanctions against Russia. Mueller is preparing to submit to U.S. Attorney General William Barr the report on his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully tried to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied election interference. Here is an explanation of the Trump Moscow tower project and what the president has said about it. Trump, a wealthy New York real estate developer, had discussed expanding his business empire into Russia for more than three decades. In 2013, after visiting Russia and hosting his Miss Universe pageant there, he wrote on Twitter: “TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next.” The Trump Organization’s longtime partner in the project was Felix Sater, a Russian-born, Brooklyn-raised real estate developer, according to company emails released to congressional investigators. Trump in October 2015 signed a non-binding letter of intent to move forward with a Moscow tower project with a Russian development firm. The firm, I.C. Expert Investment Co, agreed to construct the skyscraper, and the Trump Organization agreed to license its name and manage the building’s operations. The letter of intent described a building in a Moscow business district with 250 luxury residential condominiums, at least 150 hotel rooms and a luxury spa. Sater, who has served prison time in the United States for assault and later became an FBI informant on organized crime, assured Cohen in a November 2015 email he could get the Russian government to support a Trump property in Moscow. “I know how to play it and we will get this done. Buddy our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this,” Sater told Cohen in that email. Trump had announced his presidential candidacy in June 2015.  In testimony last month to the House of Representatives Oversight and Reform Committee, Cohen said Sater came up with a “marketing stunt” of offering Putin a free penthouse in the tower to drive up unit prices, “no different than in any condo where they start listing celebrities that live in the property.” Cohen’s House testimony portrayed Trump as keenly interested in completing the deal even as he campaigned for president. “Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project,” Cohen testified. In his guilty plea, Cohen admitted he had lied to Congress in a 2017 letter that claimed he had only discussed the negotiations with Trump three times and that the project talks ended in January 2016. Cohen said he lied to Congress to minimize links between Trump and the project and give the false impression that the proposal had ended before key early milestones in the 2016 race to determine the Republican presidential nominee. Cohen in his guilty plea said the project was discussed within the Trump Organization multiple times and that he spoke with Sater about obtaining Russian governmental approval as late as June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican nomination. Legal filings in Cohen’s plea deal did not make clear why the negotiations ended. But June 2016 was the month when the Washington Post first reported that Russian hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers, a cyber operation that was a key part of Moscow’s interference in the presidential race, as described by U.S. intelligence. One of Trump’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, indicated in January 2019 that the Moscow tower discussions had continued through the November 2016 election, though he later backtracked. Trump’s public statements about business dealings in Russia have evolved over time. In July 2016, Trump told a news conference: “I have nothing to do with Russia.” Nine days before becoming president, Trump wrote on Twitter, “Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!” In November 2018, after Cohen’s guilty plea, Trump told reporters that in 2016 he was in a position “to possibly do a deal to build a building of some kind in Moscow.” Trump added, “There would be nothing wrong if I did do it. I was running my business while I was campaigning. There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business. And why should I lose lots of opportunities?” Cohen told the House panel Trump made clear to him that he should lie about when the negotiations ended. Trump and his allies have called Cohen a liar trying to reduce his prison time after pleading guilty to a series of federal criminal charges. Cohen told the House panel that he briefed the president’s son and daughter, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, about the tower negotiations. Donald Trump Jr., an executive at the Trump Organization, told Congress in September 2017 he was only “peripherally aware” of the talks during the campaign. Ivanka Trump, a former Trump Organization executive, told ABC News last month she knew “literally almost nothing” about the project, saying there were “40 or 50 deals like that were floating around, that somebody was looking at.” Reporting by Jan  Wolfe; Editing by Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

788,"Explainer: Road to Mueller report paved by Watergate, Iran-Contra, Lewinsky, Waco - Reuters","March 19, 2019 /  11:10 AM / a month ago","8 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller, examining potential conspiracy between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, is leading the latest in a series of high-profile U.S. investigations conducted by prosecutors outside usual Justice Department channels in recent decades. The release of the findings by previous investigators analogous to Mueller has been handled differently, sometimes with voluminous reports and other times with no reports or with key elements kept under wraps for months and even years. Mueller is preparing to submit a report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr on his findings, including Russia’s role in the election and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. The Republican president has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied election interference. Barr already is coming under pressure from lawmakers to make the entire document public quickly, though he has wide latitude in what to release. Here is an explanation of some past investigations and how their findings were made public. The Justice Department named a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal that eventually forced Republican Richard Nixon in 1974 to become the only U.S. president to resign from office. At the time, no specific regulations or laws governed special prosecutors.  Attorney General Elliot Richardson, as a condition of his Senate confirmation, appointed Archibald Cox as a special prosecutor to examine the 1972 break-in by Republican operatives at Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Cox found himself at odds with Nixon over subpoenas to obtain taped White House conversations. Nixon ultimately ordered the firing of Cox, and several top Justice Department officials resigned in protest including Richardson, in an event dubbed the Saturday Night Massacre.  Leon Jaworski, subsequently named as the new Watergate special prosecutor, prepared a report with his findings, known as the “road map,” to assist Congress with possible impeachment proceedings to remove Nixon from office. The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee used it as a basis for hearings and passed articles of impeachment, though Nixon quit before the full House could act. The 1974 “road map” remained under seal by a federal court until it was released by federal archivists in 2018. IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR The job of independent counsel, with broader powers, was created by Congress after the Watergate scandal. In 1986, Lawrence Walsh was named as independent counsel to investigate the Iran-Contra affair involving illegal arms sales to Iran under Republican President Ronald Reagan, with the proceeds diverted to fund rebels in Nicaragua called Contras. The probe lasted nearly seven years and led to criminal charges against 14 people. The convictions of some prominent officials - Oliver North and John Poindexter - were overturned on appeal. In 1992, Republican President George H.W. Bush pardoned others. Walsh submitted his final report in 1993 to a federal court, which had the power to release it publicly but was not required to do so. Its release was delayed after people identified in the report sued to keep it suppressed. A federal appeals court ruled in 1994 that it should be released in the public interest. Walsh then unveiled it at a news conference. Attorney General Janet Reno in 1994 appointed Robert Fiske as a independent counsel to investigate allegations of impropriety by Democratic President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton regarding real estate investments in the Whitewater Development Corporation. Fiske’s probe was expanded to include reviewing the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster, which police had ruled a suicide. Fiske, who was not subject to the independent counsel law because it had temporarily lapsed, publicly released an interim report in 1994 clearing White House officials of wrongdoing in the Whitewater affair and confirming that Foster’s death was a suicide unrelated to Whitewater. On that same day, Clinton signed a law reauthorizing the independent counsel statute, which paved the way for a federal court to replace Fiske as independent counsel with Kenneth Starr. Starr turned in a report on Foster’s death to federal courts in 1997, also finding no foul play. It remained under seal for three months before being released. Starr’s probe expanded into other areas, including a sexual affair between Clinton and White House intern Monica Lewinsky and alleged improprieties in the White House travel office. His expansive 445-page report, containing explicit details on Clinton’s sexual affair, was sent to Congress in 1998. Two days later, lawmakers voted to release it publicly. Its findings triggered an unsuccessful Republican effort to remove Clinton from office through the impeachment process. In 2018, Starr wrote that he regretted taking on the Lewinsky part of the investigation, but felt he had no other option. Congress let the independent counsel law expire, with some lawmakers believing Starr went too far. The Justice Department in 1999 wrote regulations creating the new job of special counsel, with more limited powers. Reno in 1999 appointed John Danforth as special counsel to investigate the 1993 federal raid on the Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas. The FBI used tear gas and a fire broke out, killing more than 70 people including cult leader David Koresh.  Danforth was the first person appointed under the 1999 regulations, the rules that now apply to Mueller. Under those rules, a special counsel must submit a confidential report to the attorney general, who then has discretion to publicly release some or all of it. The attorney general must weigh the public interest. But he also must consider thorny issues such as secrecy of grand jury testimony, protecting classified information, communications with the White House possibly subject to the principle of executive privilege shielding certain information from disclosure, and safeguarding confidential reasons for why some individuals were not charged. Reno specifically instructed Danforth to prepare two versions of his report, a confidential one and another for public release. Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, gave no such instruction to Mueller when he appointed him in May 2017. In 2000, Danforth held a news conference to publicly release his report, exonerating federal agents and Justice Department officials of any wrongdoing. In 2003, James Comey, then the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, appointed Patrick Fitzgerald as special counsel to investigate how CIA operative Valerie Plame’s cover was blown through media leaks. Fitzgerald was not appointed under the 1999 regulations and was not bound by them. Fitzgerald held a 2005 news conference to announce that a grand jury had returned a five-count indictment against Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, for obstruction of justice, perjury and making false statements. Fitzgerald never published a final report on his findings. A jury convicted Libby. Republican President George W. Bush commuted his sentence in 2007. Trump gave Libby a full pardon in 2018. Reporting by Sarah N.

789,Trump says he does not mind if public sees Mueller's Russia probe report - Reuters,"March 22, 2019 /  12:54 PM / a month ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he does not mind if the public is allowed to see the report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is preparing about his investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any possible links to the Trump campaign. “Let it come out, let people see it, that’s up to the attorney general ... and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see if it’s fair,” he added. Mueller is preparing to submit a report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr on his findings, including Russia’s role in the election and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Barr already is coming under pressure from lawmakers to make the entire document public quickly, though he has wide latitude in what to release. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 420-0 last week on a non-binding resolution calling for Mueller’s report to be released both to Congress and to the public, but it is not clear how the measure will fare in the Senate. Asked if the public should be allowed to see the report, Trump said: “I don’t mind.” He said he had no idea when it would be released. As he has before, Trump questioned the legitimacy of Mueller’s investigation. “I had the greatest electoral victory - one of them - in the history of our country, tremendous success, tens of millions of voters and now somebody’s going to write a report who never got a vote,” he said. Mueller was appointed to handle the Russia investigation in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing the effort. Mueller has previously held several senior positions in the Justice Department, including FBI Director.

The central bank says any future moves will be heavily data-dependent. The mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction sector fell by 1.6 percent, the sixth consecutive decline, as weaker international demand cut output of most kinds of metals. Potash and coal mining also posted drops. Transportation and warehousing dipped by 1.6 percent, the largest decline since June 2011, on a 10.8 percent plunge in rail transportation.

He also said the bank was leaving its inflation forecasts unchanged at 14.6 percent for end-2019 and 8.2 percent next year as he presented the bank’s quarterly inflation report, pledging to use all tools available to boost confidence in the currency. The assurances received only a lukewarm welcome by investors who were looking for more detail on a drop in the net foreign-exchange reserves that could be used to head off another currency crisis, and the lira slipped a bit before recovering. Last year’s crisis tipped the Turkish economy into recession. The lira has dropped another 12 percent this year due in part to worries that the central bank would tighten policy too soon to sustainably lower annual price rises, which was 19.71 percent in March, four times higher than target. Last week, the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 24 percent but in its statement dropped a previous reference to possible further tightening if needed, a dovish shift that hit the lira. Cetinkaya talked down the significance of the change in the statement’s wording, saying it “reflected a structural approach more than a short-term signal of direction.” “If upward risks (to inflation) materialise, additional tightening can be provided the moment that the monetary policy committee sees a need on this issue,” he said. The lira weakened as far as 5.9850 against the dollar during the presentation, its weakest since Oct. 12, but it rebounded partially to 5.9670 afterwards. Investors are increasingly concerned about inflation, which peaked at a 15-year high above 25 percent in October in the wake of the crisis that wiped nearly 30 percent off the lira’s value last year. Piotr Matys, emerging markets forex strategist at Rabobank, said Cetinkaya’s comments indicate the central bank realized it was a mistake last week to remove its firm commitment to raise rates. “It’s all confusing. At a time that the central bank’s credibility is not particularly high, policymakers cannot afford to send such confusing signals,” he said. The latest bout of lira weakness began in late March due to strained U.S. diplomatic ties, challenges by President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party in April to election results in Istanbul, and a drawdown in the central bank’s reserves, which on a gross level stood at $75.57 billion and at $26.9 billion on a net level on April 19. Yet Cetinkaya said recent fluctuations in the bank’s forex reserves were not abnormal. He added that it was important to look at medium term trends when looking at reserve levels, and there was no deterioration in any parameter of reserve effectiveness. Analysts said the governor’s comments did not fully convince markets. “The statements made were not able to fully remove the markets’ question marks regarding the net reserves,” said Muammer Komurcuoglu, economist at Is Investment. Turkey’s central bank ramped up its use of swaps to boost overall reserves last month, bank data showed last week. Cetinkaya said the bank knew the impact of swap transactions on reserves, and that the increase in swap transactions was carried out to support the market in the face of a market anomaly. He added the bank would decisively use all tools available to bring down inflation in line with targets, forecasting inflation would fall to single digits in the second quarter of 2020.

800,Trump says he does not mind if public sees Mueller's Russia probe report - Reuters,"March 20, 2019 /  4:44 PM / in a month","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he does not mind if the public is allowed to see the report that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is preparing about his investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any possible links to the Trump campaign. “Let it come out, let people see it, that’s up to the attorney general ... and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see if it’s fair,” he added. Mueller is preparing to submit a report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr on his findings, including Russia’s role in the election and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Barr already is coming under pressure from lawmakers to make the entire document public quickly, though he has wide latitude in what to release. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 420-0 last week on a non-binding resolution calling for Mueller’s report to be released both to Congress and to the public, but it is not clear how the measure will fare in the Senate. Asked if the public should be allowed to see the report, Trump said: “I don’t mind.” He said he had no idea when it would be released. As he has before, Trump questioned the legitimacy of Mueller’s investigation. “I had the greatest electoral victory - one of them - in the history of our country, tremendous success, tens of millions of voters and now somebody’s going to write a report who never got a vote,” he said. Mueller was appointed to handle the Russia investigation in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing the effort. Mueller has previously held several senior positions in the Justice Department, including FBI Director.

801,Democrats push financial inclusion as 2020 election race heats up - Reuters,"March 22, 2019 /  11:13 AM / in a month","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boosting access to the U.S. banking system is emerging as a prominent theme as Democrats tap discontent over income inequality ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Following the 2008 financial crisis, many banks pulled back from their poorest customers. The shift has had lasting costs for millions of Americans now struggling to access mainstream financial services such as checking accounts and credit cards. Ten years later, Democrats, driven by progressive firebrands like Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, see financial inclusion as a draw for voters. The three Democrats, along with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, have advocated for the U.S. Postal Service to provide banking services. Senator Cory Booker has said he wants to ban overdraft fees and Senator Kamala Harris has called for a crackdown on payday lenders. Gillibrand, Booker, Harris, Sanders and Warren are all running for president. Humu Issifu, an African-American school worker from Chicago, said overdraft debt led her to close her checking account. Issifu, who now has a savings account, said she felt lawmakers do not care about struggles like hers but they should. “I think more young students, more people would vote,” Issifu, 26, said. Unlike other liberal issues such as affordable housing, gun-control and taxing the rich, financial inclusion resonates among two key demographic groups: minorities and the rural Americans who powered Donald Trump into the White House, experts say. “Candidates ... are looking for ways to raise issues that are inherently about racial justice. They want to make sure they are mobilizing black and Latino voters,” said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of Action Center on Race & the Economy. “But they are also looking for things that are common themes for people living in rural communities. Financial inclusion is one of those things that ties together those people.” Nearly 85 million Americans, predominantly from low-income, rural and minority backgrounds, do not have a bank account or only have access to basic banking services, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data compiled in 2017.  [See graphic tmsnrt.rs/2Ogvxwj] Both “unbanked” and “underbanked” households spend on average 10 percent of their annual income – as much as the average household spends on food – to access basic services like check cashing or credit, according to a 2014 government study. “It’s expensive to be poor,” Warren told Reuters in a statement. “We need a strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that cracks down on payday lenders ... And we need postal banking so people in every community in America have easy and convenient access to basic banking products,” she added. Beyond overdraft charges, many Americans cannot afford minimum balances, annual fees and ATM fees associated with many bank accounts. The cost of accessing financial services exacerbates the gap between the rich and the poor, a source of rising anger among voters which Democrats have seized upon. “The paradox is that the economy is doing great but there is a disconnect between households and the economy,” said Ida Rademacher, executive director of nonprofit the Aspen Institute’s Financial Security Program. “A country’s financial system is a key determinant of whether an economy is fair or just.” A 2018 Pew Research Center poll found 63 percent of U.S. adults believe the economy is unfairly tilted toward the rich and powerful. “Closing the wealth gap and helping underbanked Americans achieve financial security are top priorities for Senator Gillibrand,” her campaign spokesman said. Josh Orton, an adviser to Sanders’ campaign, said Sanders had long fought to curb payday lenders and introduce postal banking. Representatives for Ocasio-Cortez, Booker and Harris did not respond to requests for comment. Progressives like Warren and Sanders have pushed financial inclusion for years but the issue is getting more traction as progressives gain sway in the Democratic Party, said Mehrsa Baradaran, professor at the University of Georgia who has advised several campaigns. Nationally, the unbanked and underbanked population has declined since the crisis, driven mainly by wage gains spurred by economic growth, the FDIC found. That improvement has been uneven, with the percentage of unbanked in a dozen states growing between 2013 and 2017, and could reverse if the economy slumps. While rural households are more likely to encounter barriers accessing financial services, many cities have higher rates of unbanked than the national average, the data shows. “I could see our life was getting harder and harder because I didn’t have an account,” said Dasan King, 19, a San Francisco movie-theater worker who spent up to 5 percent of his paychecks cashing them until he was able to open a bank account. King said he was angry about the fees but was skeptical politicians would address the problem.

802,Man charged with sending bombs to Trump critics pleads guilty - Reuters,"March 21, 2019 /  8:50 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida man pleaded guilty on Thursday to using weapons of mass destruction and other crimes in connection with mailing explosives to prominent Democrats and other critics of U.S. President Donald Trump. Cesar Sayoc, 57, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan federal court, speaking in a halting, shaky voice that often dropped to a whisper. He admitted to sending 16 devices “designed to look like pipe bombs” consisting of a plastic pipe filled with powder from fireworks and fertilizer, a digital clock and wires. All of the devices were intercepted before reaching their intended targets, and none exploded. Sayoc listed the intended recipients of his packages, including former President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, U.S. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, billionaire investor and Democratic donor George Soros, former Central Intelligence Agency director John Brennan, actor Robert DeNiro and CNN. After describing what he did, he broke down in sobs, for several seconds unable to speak. “I know that these actions were wrong and I am extremely sorry,” he finally said. When Rakoff asked Sayoc whether he intended the devices to explode, or to kill or injure people, Sayoc said he did not. However, he admitted that he knew there was a risk they could explode. In addition to using weapons of mass destruction, the charges include mailing explosives with an intent to kill or injure people or property, and conveying threats through interstate commerce. Sayoc faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced on Sept. 12. Sayoc, a part-time pizza deliveryman, grocery worker and former stripper, was arrested in October after a four-day manhunt. At the time, he had been living in a white van plastered with pro-Trump stickers, the slogan “CNN SUCKS” and images of Democratic leaders with red cross-hairs over their faces. All of his intended targets are either prominent Democratic politicians or critics of Trump, a Republican. A native of New York City’s Brooklyn borough and a registered Republican, Sayoc railed against Democrats, Muslims and liberals on Facebook and Twitter. Public records showed that he had been arrested multiple times for domestic violence, theft and other charges, including threatening to bomb an electric company over a billing dispute.

805,Frontier market debt burden rises to $3.2 trillion in 2018 -IIF - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:18 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadLONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Smaller and riskier emerging markets hit $3.2 trillion in debt at the end of 2018, but hard currency issuance by governments and companies slowed, an Institute of International Finance (IIF) report showed on Tuesday. Debt owed by governments, companies, financial institutions and households across so-called frontier countries rose by more than $250 billion during 2018 to reach 117 percent of gross domestic product compared to 100 percent in 2012, the IIF said. And a steep rise in government debt could prove painful for vulnerable economies across a 26 country sample ranging from Pakistan and Kazakhstan to Vietnam and Bahrain, it added. “At around 50 percent, government debt-to-GDP is 15 percentage points higher than in 2008,” IIF economist Khadija Mahmood wrote in a note. “The rise has been most notable for Zambia and Tunisia, while government debt-to-GDP is highest for Jamaica, Jordan, Bahrain and Sri Lanka.” Emerging markets had a torrid year in 2018 with crisis in Turkey and Argentina roiling developing nations around the world while the prospect of rising borrowing costs did little to soothe frayed investor nerves. Issuers from many smaller and riskier economies have found it difficult to tap capital markets in recent months. Data from the IIF showed debt sales in hard currency from frontier markets has fallen to less than 40 percent of total issuance, compared to more than 50 percent a year earlier.

806,How to train your machine: JPMorgan FX algos learn to trade better - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:20 PM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase, a top player in the $5.1 trillion-a-day global currency market has started applying a new technology that enables machine-trading programs to learn from previous trades and search for the most profitable way to execute them. Algorithmic trading is a growing trend in currency markets where banks have cut back on trading teams, relying more on automated computing strategies to trade efficiently.  Algos, as these programs are known, are used by market makers to search at lightening speed for platforms with deeper liquidity pools or break up large orders into tiny bits tor reduce market impact.  But large banks have been investing millions of dollars into technology to grab a greater share of the algo trading market. JPMorgan told Reuters its new algorithm — named DNA or Deep Neural Network for Algo Execution — effectively combined what a multitude of algos currently do, into a single strategy and allowed the framework to judge how a client order should be executed. For example, a typical time-weighted average price order executed by an algorithm may aim to buy a particular amount of currency over a few minutes or hours. But if the order is not executed within that time frame, the machine will trade aggressively toward the end to buy the required amount. The new algo aims to take that decision-making process one step further by determining on how best to execute the transaction, based on results of past trades.  The algo has already been deployed for trading G7 currencies such as the euro, dollar and sterling, where it has access to data from thousands of past trades.  “The objective of an algo is to minimize market impact by executing in an efficient and timely manner,” Chi Nzelu, head of macro eCommerce at JP Morgan, told Reuters.  “What we have done is establish a neural network using a machine learning technique which determines how to place the order, at what price and execution style.” Unlike equities which trade on exchanges, currency trading takes place on a multitude of platforms, enabling the usage of such automated trading strategies. Trading platform EBS estimates as much as 70 percent of orders on its platform now originate from algorithms, whereas in 2004, all trading was undertaken by humans. JP Morgan’s own trading platform too has seen algorithmic turnover surge.  Order volumes of over $5 million rose 50 percent on an annual basis, and 80 percent of orders were driven by algos, the bank said, adding that December had set a record for its algo franchise in terms of orders as a proportion of spot turnover.  A report by Greenwich Associates last week found JP Morgan and Citibank were at the top of the field in of electronic  currency trading, which now accounts for 80 percent of global turnover.

808,"UPDATE 1-Brazil's unemployment rate rises to 12.7%, reflects weak labor market - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  1:08 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds details, context) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, April 30 (Reuters) - Brazil’s jobless rate rose to 12.7% in the three months to March from 12.4% in the three months to February, IBGE statistics agency said on Tuesday, with underemployment hitting its highest level since comparable records began in 2012. The unemployment rate was slightly lower than the 12.8%median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, but the overall picture painted by the figures was of an economy struggling to generate any significant growth momentum. It was the third month in a row where the unemployment rate has risen, and marked a quarterly rise in the jobless rate of 1.1 percentage points from October-December last year, the figures showed. The number of unemployed people in Brazil rose to 13.4 million in the first quarter, an increase of 1.2 million, or more than 10%, from the fourth quarter of last year, IBGE said. Perhaps more significantly, the levels of underemployment and workers leaving the workforce all together rose sharply in the three months to March, suggesting the labor market’s underlying conditions were deteriorating. The rate of underemployment rose to 25% from 23.8% in the preceding three months, the highest since the series began in 2012, IBGE said. The percentage of people who had taken themselves out of the workforce rose to 4.8% from 4.2% percent, also a series high. The high degree of slack in the labor market helped ensure there was no wage growth, with average real monthly earnings remaining steady at 2,291 reais ($583), the IBGE figures showed. Tuesday’s figures were the latest in a series of disappointing reports on Brazil’s labor market. Earlier this month, data showed the economy shed a net 43,196 formal jobs in March, far worse than the net addition of 79,000 jobs economists had expected. $1 = 3.93 reais

The S&P 500 on Monday topped its intraday record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21, rising to a session high of 2,949.52. The benchmark index is now up 17.4% for the year. Hopes of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve have powered the rally in stocks this year, from a steep sell-off in late 2018. “Markets are at all-time highs. I think investors are starting to question what’s going to take us higher and with numbers like Google, it isn’t something that would excite average investors right now,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Alphabet Inc fell 8% in pre-market trading after the company posted its slowest revenue growth in three years. Apple Inc shares dipped 0.6%, ahead of results later in the day, which will wrap up earnings for the high-growth FAANG stocks. Lifting Dow futures, McDonald’s Corp gained 2.1% after the company reported a better-than-expected rise in sales at established U.S. restaurants. Among other gainers on the Dow, Pfizer Inc rose 1% and Merck & Co Inc climbed 1.2% after both the drugmakers reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. With earnings now in full swing, analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to drop 0.2% in the first quarter, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. General Electric Co jumped 7.9% after the industrial conglomerate’s first-quarter profit rose. At 8:43 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 38 points, or 0.14%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 2.5 points, or 0.08% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 24.25 points, or 0.31%. U.S. futures and global equities came under pressure earlier on Tuesday, after official and private business surveys suggested slower Chinese factory growth this month, quashing hopes of a steady reading or even a faster expansion. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. Also on the radar was the Fed which kicks off a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced.

Bourses in Britain, France and Germany lost ground after the surveys on China manufacturing missed forecasts, offering another sign that Beijing’s efforts to spur growth in the world’s second-biggest economy have yet to bear fruit. Both official and private business surveys suggested slower Chinese factory growth this month, dashing hopes for a steady reading or even a faster expansion. Data also showed a slower expansion in China’s services sector. Those figures underscored questions over prospects for the Chinese economy, with investors across the world already on edge over growing signs of a two-speed global economy where a robust United States outpaces its peers. In early afternoon trading, the Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent. British shares were off 0.2 percent while the German and French markets were 0.1 and 0.3 percent down respectively. Amid uncertainty on China’s prospects, investors in Europe focused on data that could offer clues to the health of their own region’s economy. The euro gained a quarter of a percentage point after figures showed growth in the euro zone grew more than expected in the first quarter, a fillip after poor manufacturing inflation data last month. German annual inflation, meanwhile, beat the European Central Bank’s target level for the first time since November as it grew to 2.1 percent in April. Inflation in the euro zone is the key issue for ECB policymakers, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. “Unemployment is down, wages are starting to edge higher but inflation remains very subdued,” he said. “That is the biggest problem for the European Central Bank in terms of its policy response in trying to lift demand in the euro area.” France earlier reported steady growth for the first quarter, while Spain’s economy also grew faster than expected. Beyond economic data, corporate earnings were another major factor on Monday. Chipmaker AMS  jumped 16 percent after beating forecasts for first-quarter profit. AMS is a supplier to Apple, which is due to report its results later. Banks dragged heavily on the STOXX 600. Danske Bank, hit by money-laundering scandals, fell more than 6 percent after lowering its outlook for 2019, while No. 1 euro zone bank Santander also slipped after a drop in first-quarter net profit. In contrast, Standard Chartered climbed 4 percent after unveiling plans for share buybacks of up to $1 billion, its first in at least 20 years. Asian markets had fallen earlier on the Chinese data, albeit in thin trading. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.5 percent. Bourses in South Korea and Hong Kong also fell. Japan’s financial markets are closed this week as Japanese Emperor Akihito prepares to abdicate. Crown Prince Naruhito, Akihito’s elder son, will take the Chrysanthemum Throne on Wednesday. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ticked up 0.1 percent. Wall Street futures gauges were flat or marginally down. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield rose to a one-week high after the positive euro zone growth data and regional inflation figures, breaking above zero percent. And as the euro gained ground, FX traders were focused on whether European data would push currencies out of recent trading ranges. Even marginal growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. “The data offers some relief to traders, though it is still too early to say if the economic risks have completely lifted,” said Commerzbank FX strategist Esther Maria Reichelt. Analysts had warned that markets could dial back predictions of an interest rate increase by the European Central Bank next year if the data was weak. The Chinese data fuelled gains in Japan’s yen, which rallied to a three-week high in holiday-thinned trading. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was down 0.4 percent at 97.508 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it seeks to balance robust economic growth against low inflation. In commodity markets, oil prices topped $73 as Venezuela’s opposition leader called on the military to back him to end Nicolas Maduro’s rule and after Saudi Arabia said a deal between producers to curb output could be extended beyond June.

812,"House panel interviews Sater, holds hearing in Russia probe - Reuters","March 21, 2019 /  2:17 PM / 2 months ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives intelligence committee said on Thursday it will hold an open hearing and an interview with Felix Sater, a Russian-American involved in negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, next week as part of its Russia investigation. The intelligence panel’s open hearing next Thursday will focus on the Kremlin’s use of money, oligarchs and intelligence in the 2016 presidential race. Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul was scheduled to testify, the panel said. The interview with Sater, who has served prison time in the United States for assault and later became an FBI informant on organized crime, had been set for last month but is scheduled for Wednesday, the committee said in a statement. Sater told Reuters he also was to appear before the House Judiciary Committee next Thursday in a closed session. Sater, who was born in Russia and raised in New York, is a property developer who worked with U.S. President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen on the Moscow project while Trump was running for president. Sater is expected to testify about his work on the Moscow project, which came under renewed scrutiny after Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about when negotiations on the deal ended in order to minimize Trump’s links to Russia. The intelligence committee’s Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff, has said the panel is focusing on the Trump tower negotiations. Sater was originally scheduled to testify publicly before the panel on March 14.

813,Solar and wind firms call the 'Green New Deal’ too extreme - Reuters,"March 21, 2019 /  11:08 AM / in 2 months","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. solar and wind power companies may have the most to gain from the Green New Deal, an ambitious proposal backed by several Democratic presidential candidates to end U.S. fossil fuel consumption within a decade. But do not expect the renewable energy firms to endorse it. Representatives of America’s clean energy companies are withholding their support for the climate-fighting plan, calling it unrealistic and too politically divisive for an industry keen to grow in both red and blue states. The cool reaction reflects the difficulty that progressive politicians vying for the White House may have in selling aggressive global-warming policy to the business community and more moderate voters. It also underscores a new reality for U.S. solar and wind power companies long associated with the environmental left: As they have improved technology and lowered prices, their growth is shifting from politically liberal coastal states to the more conservative heartland, where skepticism of climate change and government subsidies runs high.   “If you just broadly endorse the Green New Deal, you are liable to upset one side of the aisle or the other. And that’s not constructive,” said Tom Werner, the CEO of SunPower Corp, one of the nation’s biggest solar power companies. “The idea that you could go 100 percent (clean energy) in 10 years would require a lot of things happening perfectly, simultaneously,” he said. “You’d have to have bipartisan support, 52-state support.” The Green New Deal was introduced last month by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat Congresswoman from New York, along with fellow Democrat Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. It has since become the center of a renewed debate in Washington about how vigorously the government must act to address climate change. The Congressional resolution, which has no force of law, calls for the federal government to make investments to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in a decade by meeting 100 percent of America’s power demand with clean, renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, or geothermal energy. It also calls for massive investments in green infrastructure projects like “smart grids” to improve efficiency, along with a guarantee of millions of high-wage jobs with paid vacations, medical leave and retirement security. The resolution does not get into detail about how subsequent legislation would achieve these goals. So far, at least eight Democratic presidential hopefuls – including senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota – have endorsed the plan as they seek to stand in stark opposition to the pro-drilling policies of President Donald Trump. Trump’s fellow Republicans have widely panned the Green New Deal, saying it would cost trillions of dollars of taxpayer money, may be technically unfeasible, and smacks of radical socialism.  Rhiana Gunn Wright, founder of the think tank New Consensus, which is drawing up Green New Deal policies, said her group will not estimate costs of the plan until it is more fully drafted next year. She said opponents’ estimates are premature and do not account for the benefits of climate action and the costs of inaction. The feasibility of the proposal has been a source of concern for the clean energy industry, too.   “We love the enthusiasm the Green New Deal has brought to the climate issue ... but we need to operate in political reality,” said Dan Whitten, vice president of public affairs at the Solar Energy Industries Association, the solar industry’s main lobby group.  Another concern is the fact that the plan extends beyond energy and climate policies to include guarantees of jobs, training and healthcare for communities affected by climate change, said Greg Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, a non-profit organization promoting renewable energy industries.  “It creates controversy and complexity, tying this to issues that are not in our sphere,” he said. Representatives of renewable energy firms Sunrun and Sunnova Energy said they were happy the Green New Deal was drawing so much attention to clean industry but stopped short of endorsing the plan. “The Green New Deal has sparked an important conversation, and we’re excited to be part of it,” said Alex McDonough, Vice President of Public Policy at Sunrun.  The U.S. solar and wind industries have expanded over the last decade, thanks to lucrative government subsidies, and now employ some 350,000 workers nationwide - more than four times more than the coal sector, according to the 2019 U.S. Energy and Employment Report released this month.  While the growth began in liberal-leaning regions such as California and New England, it has more recently come in states that voted heavily for President Donald Trump in 2016, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Florida, according to data from the American Wind Energy Association, Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and SEIA. That has helped strengthen the industry’s appeal to Republican lawmakers, allowing it to rebrand as a jobs engine in addition to a tool for combating global warming. And during the last election cycle in 2018, solar and wind companies contributed significantly more money to Republican candidates than to their traditional Democratic allies. “We have raised these industries above science experiments and feel-goodery, and we are now real businesses and can’t just play to one half of the country,” said one renewable sector lobbyist, who asked not to be named discussing the topic. “Staying out of the line of fire is the goal of most companies and trade associations,” said another clean energy industry representative. “There will be a real danger for our industry and companies if they are shouting out about the Green New Deal from the rooftops.” The Sunrise Movement, a grassroots group that brought the Green New Deal into the national spotlight by holding demonstrations and confronting lawmakers on video, said it was aware of the reticence of green energy companies to back their proposal. “We’ve met with companies and industries who could have a lot to gain from the Green New Deal, but the politics at this stage are too difficult to navigate,” Sunrise co-founder Evan Weber said.  He said Sunrise had met with the SEIA and AWEA, along with other executives. Weber said industry support for the Green New Deal would be welcomed but is not vital: “We don’t expect all of them to be a strong advocate for the Green New Deal until the politics shift.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian ThevenotAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

814,Trump's border wall money may come at expense of schools for military kids - Reuters,"March 20, 2019 /  6:26 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense is proposing to pay for President Donald Trump’s much-debated border wall by shifting funds away from projects that include $1.2 billion for schools, childcare centers and other facilities for military children, according to a list it has provided to lawmakers. The Pentagon gave Congress a list on Monday that included $12.8 billion of construction projects for which it said funds could be redirected. Around 10 percent of the list relates to educational establishments and includes school buildings for the children of service members in places like Germany, Japan, Kentucky and Puerto Rico. The move comes as a surprise given the Trump administration’s oft-touted support for the sacrifices made by military families and suggests the White House’s desire to build a wall on the border with Mexico outstrips nearly all other issues. However, of the $1.2 billion in projects related to education, approximately $800 million worth are far in the future, and those funds could readily be used for wall construction and replaced later. The Pentagon told Congress that just because a project was listed, it “does not mean that the project will, in fact, be used” as a funding source to build sections of the border wall.  Trump earlier in March asked for $8.6 billion in his 2020 budget request to help pay for his promised wall on the U.S-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking. It drew swift criticism from Democrats. Trump declared a national emergency in a bid to fund the wall without congressional approval, allowing his administration to use money from the military construction budget, if needed. In a tense Congressional hearing last week, Democratic senators demanded that they be provided a list of military funds that could be utilized to fund wall construction. Military officials have vowed that they would not use any funds from military housing. A recent Reuters investigation reut.rs/2t1Y2UA found thousands of U.S. military families were subjected to serious health and safety hazards in on-base housing, prompting moves from lawmakers to improve landlord controls. But elementary and middle schools on bases around the world serving military families are at risk of suffering from the funding diversion, as well as a new engineering building and parking garage at West Point, the Army’s military academy in New York state. Joint Base Andrews, where the president’s Air Force jet is based, was slated to receive $13 million for a “Child Development Center,” but funding for that project is on the list. The base currently has three child development centers serving the 12,000 to 14,000 active and reserve military stationed there. The children of pilots for the F-35A jet, being made by Lockheed Martin at a cost of $89 million each, could be impacted. Alaska’s Eielson Air Force Base is slated to get $22.5 million to build a school to enroll 240 additional children “in a remote arctic climate” when the jet begins operations there. The current school serves 108 and has an “extensive waiting list,” according to Air Force budget documents which say that if a school is not built “children will be turned away,” “directly impacting support of the F-35 mission, morale, and welfare.” Reporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Chris Sanders, Rosalba O'Brien and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

817,"KKR, GIC betting on India's power sector with $400 mln investment -sources - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:44 AM / 7 days ago","4 Min ReadHONG KONG, April 30 (Reuters) - Global investment firm KKR & Co Inc is leading a deal to acquire a controlling stake in India Grid Trust (IndiGrid), in a bet on the country’s rapidly growing power sector, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters. KKR, together with Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC , will acquire up to 57 percent of IndiGrid for about $400 million, the people said. IndiGrid’s current market value is about $332 million. The deal would mark KKR’s first infrastructure investment in Asia since it set up a team late last year that focuses on the sector in the region. The pair will invest 20.64 billion rupees ($295 million) for a 42 percent stake in the trust via a preference equity issuance, the people said. KKR, having applied to become sponsor of IndiGrid, will then acquire a 15 percent stake from its current sponsor, Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd, pending regulatory approval. The infrastructure investment trust, the first of its kind in India, will separately raise around 4.5 billion rupees ($64.6 million) from other investors including Sterlite Power as part of the equity issue, the people said, declining to be named as the information is confidential. GIC is contributing $140 million to the deal while KKR is investing the rest from its own balance sheet, according to the people. KKR declined to provide comment for the story. GIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India’s power demand grew at about 3.6 percent in 2018/19, lagging overall economic growth. However the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases aims to double its clean energy capacity to 40 percent of total power capacity by 2030, requiring new grid infrastructure, most of which is expected to be funded by foreign money. The energy-hungry nation will launch $5 billion of transmission line tenders, beginning in June, to deliver 175 gigawatts of power from renewable sources by 2022, government officials told Reuters last month. Sterlite Power, a major private transmission developer, created IndiGrid in 2016 to run its asset operations. The trust raised $350 million in an initial public offering a year later. IndiGrid owns five assets developed by Sterlite and one from a third party and 13 transmission lines. With the capital injection, it plans to acquire five more electricity transmission assets worth 115 billion rupees from Sterlite Power, which will more than triple its assets under management to 170 billion rupees, according to the people. KKR will separately acquire a majority stake in Sterlite Investment Managers Ltd, IndiGrid’s investment manager, from Sterlite Power, they said. KKR hired David Luboff, former chief executive of Macquarie Group’s Asia Infrastructure Fund, as its head of Asia Pacific Infrastructure from the beginning of this year. It is considering launching an Asia-focused infrastructure fund which could be as large as $1.5 billion, Reuters has reported.

820,"Euro zone first-quarter economic growth stronger than expected, unemployment falls - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:44 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew more than expected in the first quarter, rebounding from a slump in the second half of 2018, while unemployment fell to its lowest in more than a decade, data showed on Tuesday. But economists said the numbers gave the European Central Bank little indication of whether to continue stimulating growth with loose monetary policy or to start tightening. The European Union’s statistics office, Eurostat, said that according to a preliminary estimate, gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2019, up from 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 0.1 percent in the third. Year-on-year, euro zone GDP rose 1.2 percent, the same increase as in the last quarter of 2018. The Eurostat data include an estimate by Germany of first-quarter GDP growth in Europe’s biggest economy, which has not yet been published. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.3 percent quarterly increase and a 1.1 percent annual expansion. “The recovery is getting old and no one should expect from a greybeard that he will continue to run at the pace he could achieve in his youth,” ING economist Peter Vanden Houte said. “And indeed, the elderly are also more vulnerable to shocks. While there are still a number of risks (think of trade tensions, higher oil prices and the Brexit uncertainty) the improving international picture is likely to support eurozone exports in the coming months,” Vanden Houte said. GDP growth should hover around 0.3 percent in the remainder of the year, he said, below ECB and European Commission forecasts of growth at 0.4 percent in the second half of 2019.  “Not great, but probably the best we can expect in the current stage of the cycle,” he said. The ECB, which put off tightening monetary policy at the end of last year amid persistently weak inflation, had expected first-quarter growth of 0.2 percent, accelerating to 0.3 percent in the second quarter. Separately, Eurostat said that euro zone unemployment fell to 7.7 percent of the workforce in March with 12.630 million people seeking jobs — the lowest rate since September 2008 — against 7.8 percent of the workforce or 12.804 million people in February. The fall in the number of jobless people is likely to eventually put upward pressure on consumer prices. The ECB wants to see inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium term. “Today’s figures probably haven’t made the European Central Bank any wiser,” ING’s Vanden Houte said. “The economy remains solid enough not to need extra stimulus. But at the same time not much has to go wrong to bring GDP growth to a standstill. In that regard, wait-and-see remains the most likely ECB monetary policy stance,” he said.

821,Russia's Magnit pulls bid for Lenta as Mordashov's offer moves on - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  10:28 AM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s second-biggest food retailer Magnit has dropped plans to bid for smaller rival Lenta, paving the way for Russian steel magnate Alexey Mordashov to seal a takeover valuing Lenta at about $1.75 billion.  Magnit this month made a non-binding, indicative proposal worth $1.78 billion to buy Lenta, Russia’s third-largest grocery retailer, seeking to thwart Mordashov’s plans. However, when asked on Tuesday whether the company planned to pursue the acquisition, a Magnit official said it was not considering any major deals at the moment.  Magnit sent its proposal to Lenta on April 1, the same day U.S. private equity fund TPG and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) agreed to sell their 42 percent stake in Lenta to Mordashov for $3.60 per global depository receipt (GDR). Magnit proposed $3.65 per GDR. Mordashov, whose Severgroup includes Russian steel producer Severstal, received approval from the anti-monopoly regulator to buy the stake from TPG and the EBRD last week. Severgroup has now completed the purchase and launched a mandatory tender offer to acquire the remaining shares in Lenta, also for $3.60 per GDR, it said in a statement on Tuesday. “We are delighted to welcome Lenta into the Severgroup family,” Mordashov said in the statement. Lenta, with a 3.2 percent share of the Russian food retail market, will add physical stores to Mordashov’s Utkonos business, Russia’s largest online grocery retailer. “We want Lenta to maintain its public status after the mandatory tender offer closes...,” he added. The offer is valid until May 21, but may be extended for 14 days if Mordashov secures a stake of more than 50 percent. Lenta’s GDRs were down 0.1 percent in London at $3.58. Mordashov’s offer implies a value of $1.75 billion for 100 percent of Lenta and an 8-percent premium to its GDR price as of March 26. Analysts have been expecting Russia’s food retail sector to consolidate amid tougher regulation and a decline in consumers’ disposable incomes. Mid-sized food retailer O’Key said in April that Russia’s largest lender Sberbank had expressed an interest in its hypermarket business. Russian second largest lender VTB, which has a stake in Magnit, has not ruled out selling a minority stake in Lenta to Mordashov, VTB was quoted as saying in April.

822,"Wealth clients willing to pay for financial advice, 33% switch providers: study - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:19 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Wealth management clients are increasingly willing to pay for financial advice as their needs evolve, choosing an average of five providers, with one-third switching managers in the past three years, global wealth consultant EY said on Tuesday. The 2019 Global Wealth Research report showed another 33% plan to change providers in the next three years, and noted that no single provider can meet clients’ varied needs. “As the industry grapples with new entrants, new technologies and changing client expectations, wealth managers must take a step back to evaluate their offerings and redefine how they provide financial advice to better meet client needs and expectations,” the EY study said. EY, also known as Ernst & Young, is a global provider in assurance, tax transaction and advisory services. The use of independent advisors and financial technology providers, or FinTechs, is expected to rise as clients seek more customized services, according to the survey of 2,000 wealth management clients in 26 countries and 50 industry executives. The use of independent advisors is expected to rise 18% over the next three years, reflecting clients’ attraction to flexible solutions and fees, the study said. Respondents expecting to use FinTechs will increase from 38% today to 45% in the next three years, the study said. Traditional wealth managers should try to better understand clients and deliver according to their priorities, for example, by anticipating major life events. Digital channels are evolving faster than wealth managers and their clients had anticipated three years ago, the study showed.   In 2016, only 20% of clients expected they would prefer to use mobile apps for wealth management activities by 2019. The latest study shows 41% of respondents prefer mobile apps as their primary channel for wealth management.  Despite rapid demand for digital solutions, respondents still desire human interaction. Twenty-five percent of respondents prefer face-to-face meetings or phone calls as their primary method of engagement, and 42% prefer these methods when receiving financial advice. Overall, 46% of wealth management client respondents said they were unhappy with their fees and do not trust they are being charged fairly, the study showed, with dissatisfaction particularly high at 66% among ultra-high net worth clients. “Most respondents - 55% - want their wealth managers to use a payment method that offers more transparency, objectivity and certainty,” the study said. “Percentage of AUM is currently the most common payment method; however, fixed fee and hourly support methods are most desired.” Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Richard ChangAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

823,FOREX-Euro pops above $1.12 as growth data supports - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  9:58 AM / in 7 days","3 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - The euro extended gains to top $1.12 on Tuesday after first quarter growth numbers for the euro zone were stronger than expectations, dispersing some of the negativity surrounding the outlook for the single currency. Euro zone economic growth was stronger than expected in the first quarter, rebounding strongly from a slump in the second half of 2018, while unemployment fell to its lowest rate in more than a decade, data showed on Tuesday. The strong data offered some relief to traders after a disappointing manufacturing PMI survey this month and cautious comments from European Central Bank policymakers raised concerns that the broader economy is struggling to gain traction. “The data offers some relief to traders though it is still too early to say if the risks over the economy has completely lifted,” said Esther Maria Reichelt, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The single currency inched a quarter of a percent higher to $1.1215 after the data. On a year-to-date basis, it still remains one of the weakest currencies, falling more than 2 percent. Trading was broadly quiet with Japan on holiday with volumes set to get thinner on Wednesday when China and much of Europe will be off. Higher than expected growth figures could squeeze some hedge funds who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. Elsewhere, the Japanese yen rallied to a three-week high underlining the broad caution in the currency markets after China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index dipped to 50.1 April. Forecasts had been for no change from March’s 50.5 or an increase. Some of the favoured currencies in a low-volatility environment such as the Australian dollar and the Aussie/Swiss franc fell 0.2 to 0.3 percent. Trading was thin with Japan on holiday, and set to get thinner on Wednesday when China and much of Europe will be off. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at 97.839. On a monthly basis, it was up 0.6 percent and on track for a third consecutive month of gains. The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday, remains a hurdle for the dollar. No change in policy is expected, but the market wants to hear how Chairman Jerome Powell resolves the divergence between solid economic growth and slowing inflation.

824,"German inflation accelerates to ECB target in April, state data suggests - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  9:33 AM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadBERLIN, April 30 (Reuters) - Annual inflation in Europe’s largest economy accelerated in April towards the European Central Bank’s target, data from German states suggested on Tuesday, but the rise may be due to one-off price rises around the Easter holiday. The ECB aims to keep inflation in the euro zone close to, but just below, 2 percent a year. Inflation has long been below this target in the single currency bloc, and ECB rate-setter Olli Rehn said on Friday that investors may be doubting the effectiveness of the ECB’s monetary policy measures in boosting inflation. A poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested annual German consumer price inflation, harmonised to compare with data from other European Union countries, would rise to 1.7 percent from 1.4 percent. After data from the states was published, ING economist Carsten Brzeski said he expected harmonised nationwide annual inflation - due to be published at 1200 GMT - to show a 1.9 percent increase. In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany’s most populous state, consumer price inflation accelerated to 2.1 percent from 1.5 percent. Price pressures picked up in four other states too. This acceleration is, however, largely due to the cost of package holidays going up, with Easter falling later this year than last, and partly due to higher fuel prices, but inflation will likely slow again next month, Brzeski said. “There is no reason to draw any conclusions because we see this Easter fluctuation every year, which means there is no real big shift in core inflation, so for the ECB, in terms of any impact on policy decisions, it’s close to zero,” he said. Economists expect annual euro zone inflation - due to be published on May 3 - to accelerate to 1.6 percent from 1.4 percent in March. The state inflation readings, which are not harmonised to compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide preliminary inflation data.

826,Pence arrives in Nebraska as U.S. Midwest reels from historic floods - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  9:14 AM / 2 months ago","6 Min ReadBROWNVILLE, Neb. (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence in Nebraska on Tuesday took stock of the devastation unleashed across the U.S. Midwest by floods that have killed four people, left one missing and caused more than a billion dollars in damage to crops, livestock and roads. “I never fail to be inspired by moments like this. The way communities come together and people volunteer to put themselves in harm’s way to help others,” Pence said Tuesday in Omaha, according to an official statement. Pence also said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is working to expedite a request from Nebraska’s governor for a federal emergency declaration, which will provide more aid to the state. The floodwaters have inundated a large swath of farm states Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America’s longest river, prompting half of Iowa’s 99 counties to declare states of emergency. “The hearts of the American people are with those who have been impacted across the Midwest!” Pence said in the tweet earlier Tuesday. Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin have all declared states of emergency in the floods, which stem from a powerful winter hurricane known as a “bomb cyclone” that slammed into the U.S. Farm Belt last week, killing untold numbers of livestock, destroying grains and soybeans in storage, and cutting off access to farms because of road and rail damage.   The latest confirmed death was identified by the sheriff in Fremont County, Iowa, as 55-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan, who was pulled from floodwaters along with another man on Friday and later succumbed to injuries.  A Nebraska man who has been missing since the collapse of the Spencer Dam last week on the Niobrara River was identified by the Omaha World-Herald newspaper as Kenny Angel.   Authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise.          Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes. Some roadways crumbled to rubble, while sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings. In Brownville, Nebraska, floodwaters lapped at the edge of the small town of 132 people, closing the main bridge across the Missouri River. “It’s a lot worse than I’ve ever seen it,” said Malina Wheeldon, who went ahead with the scheduled opening of her new Euphoric Soul Salon & Boutique business despite the floods. Her husband, Justin, who grew up in Brownville, agreed, saying he had lived through the floods of 1993, 2010 and 2011.      “About every five years now, we have a 100-year flood,” he said. The Missouri was expected to crest at 47.5 feet (14.5 m) on Tuesday, breaking its 2011 record by more than a foot (31 cm), the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The flooding was expected to continue through Thursday. Nebraska officials estimated more than $1 billion in flood damage for the state’s agricultural sector so far, according to Craig Head, vice president of issue management at the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Head said the number was expected to grow as floodwaters recede.  “It’s really too early to know for sure how bad this is going to get. But one thing we do know: It’s catastrophic for farmers,” said Matt Perdue, government relations director for the National Farmers Union trade group.  “We’re hoping it’s only $1 billion, but that’s only a hope.” Nebraska officials estimate the floods have caused $553 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, as well as $89 million in privately owned assets, according to the state’s Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.      The water also covered about a third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home to the U.S. Strategic Command, whose responsibilities include defending against and responding to nuclear attacks. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is distributing 400,000 sandbags to operators of 12 levees along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas that were in danger of being breached by floodwaters, the Army Corps said in a news release on Tuesday. In Niobrara, Nebraska, south of the Missouri River near the border with South Dakota, Mayor Jody Stark said flooding that began on Thursday had devastated his community of 350 people, with businesses being the hardest hit. “Our road system is shot pretty much in every direction coming into town,” Stark said. “It’s one day at a time. We will do what we can to get back on our feet,” Stark said. “It’s just so heartbreaking. It’s going to be tough, but hopefully we can all get through it.” The floodwaters were the result of snowmelt following heavy rains last week and warm weather, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center. Roads leading to the Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper nuclear plant near Brownville were engulfed by floodwaters from the Missouri, but the facility was still operating safely at full power on Tuesday. The plant operator was flying staff members and supplies to the plant with helicopters, said power district spokesman Mark Becker.

827,House Democrat says Trump appeared to influence Whitaker in Cohen case - Reuters,"March 20, 2019 /  12:59 AM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading House Democrat said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump appears to have influenced former acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to raise doubts about the campaign finance case against Trump’s former lawyer.  U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Whitaker described interactions with Justice Department staff about the case against former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, which involved hush money payments to women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, during a March 13 closed-door meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a letter on Tuesday to Assistant Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, Nadler said Whitaker expressed to staff concerns that campaign finance charges against Cohen may have been “specious” and raised “serious questions” about the theory of the case overseen by federal prosecutors in New York.  Whitaker also had concerns about U.S. Attorney Geoffrey  Berman’s recusal from the case, saying the terms of the recusal were “convoluted,” according to the letter.       “It is reasonable to believe that this activity - the questions Mr Whitaker asked about Mr Cohen’s case, and the manner in which he asked them - reflected fears about the case that were likely expressed to Mr Whitaker by the president himself,” Nadler said. Whitaker appeared never to have taken official action to intervene in the Cohen case, Nadler said.  Officials at the Justice Department and White House were not immediately available for comment. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to orchestrating the hush money payments, which he said Trump directed him to make. Nadler’s committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment issues, is trying to determine whether the president has sought to obstruct justice by influencing investigations that involve him.  Trump may have urged Whitaker to Berman in charge of the Cohen case, according to a New York Times report that Trump has denied. Berman, a Trump campaign donor and former law partner of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, is recused from the case. Nadler said his committee has identified individuals who claim to have direct knowledge of conversations between Whitaker and Trump.        But during their meeting on Capitol Hill, Nadler said Whitaker refused to answer questions about any conversations he may have had with Trump “on the basis that the president may one day want to invoke executive privilege.” Whitaker, who left the Justice Department after Attorney General William Barr’s arrival last month, was appointed acting attorney general without Senate confirmation in November after Trump ousted former Attorney Jeff Sessions. Democrats feared he could interfere with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Nadler said he accepts that Whitaker never gave the White House “any promises or commitments concerning the Special Counsel’s investigation.” Nadler rejected Whitaker’s decision not to answer questions because of possible executive privilege. He asked Engel, who heads the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, to determine whether the White House would actually invoke executive privilege.

829,Israel approves Mastercard stake in bank services firm SHVA - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:48 AM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron has granted Mastercard permission to hold 10 percent of Israeli bank services firm SHVA, the central bank said on Tuesday, in a step aimed at boosting banking sector competition. Mastercard got the green light after the company signed a deal to buy the stake from Israel’s Bank Hapoalim, the Bank of Israel said. SHVA, the Hebrew acronym for Automated Banking Services Ltd, provides a large portion of the services in the payment card transaction chain in Israel. New legislation to increase competition in the sector is forcing Israel’s largest banks to reduce their stakes in SHVA to below 10 percent. Hapoalim rival Bank Leumi  last year received permission to sell a 10 percent share to Visa. The Bank of Israel said Hapoalim, Leumi and Israel Discount Bank are preparing a public offering to sell more of their stakes in SHVA to the public to take their holdings below 10 percent. Supervisor of Banks Hedva Ber said the payments sector is expected to undergo changes in coming years and that adding international players that specialize in payments will boost innovation and knowledge.

The S&P 500 on Monday topped its intraday record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21, rising to a session high of 2,949.52. The benchmark index is now up 17.4% for the year. Hopes of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve have powered the rally in stocks this year, from a steep sell-off in late 2018. Investors will also pay close attention to the next two rounds of U.S.-China trade negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators. However, U.S. futures and global equities came under pressure after official and private business surveys suggested slower Chinese factory growth this month, quashing hopes of a steady reading or even a faster expansion. At 7:17 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 17 points, or 0.06%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 7.75 points, or 0.1%. With earnings in full swing, analysts expect profits at S&P 500 companies to drop 0.2% in the first quarter, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. Among the high-growth FAANG stocks, Google-parent Alphabet Inc slumped 7.8% in pre-market trading after the company posted its slowest revenue growth in three years. Apple Inc shares dipped 0.6%, ahead of results later in the day. The iPhone maker will be wrapping up earnings for the FAANG stocks. General Electric Co jumped 6.6% after the industrial conglomerate reported first-quarter profit which more than tripled. Among Dow components trading before the bell, Pfizer Inc rose 1.4% and Merck & Co Inc climbed 1.6% after both the drugmakers reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Also on the radar was the Fed which will kick-off a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced.

835,GLOBAL MARKETS-Equities drop after China data; euro zone growth lifts single currency - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:23 AM / 7 days ago","6 Min Read* Euro STOXX 600 falls 0.1 percent * Surveys suggest slower Chinese factory growth this month * Euro zone GDP grows more strongly than expected * Euro hits day’s high on growth data * German consumer price inflation data due at 1200 GMT * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates prices; adds euro zone GDP figures) By Tom Wilson LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - European shares edged down on Tuesday after weak Chinese business surveys doused appetite for risk, while the single currency climbed after euro zone growth beat expectations. Bourses in Britain, France and Germany lost ground after the surveys on China manufacturing missed forecasts, offering another sign that Beijing’s efforts to spur growth in the world’s second-biggest economy have yet to bear fruit. Both official and private business surveys suggested slower Chinese factory growth this month, dashing hopes for a steady reading or even a faster expansion. Data also showed a slower expansion in China’s services sector. Those figures underscored questions over prospects for the Chinese economy, with investors across the world already on edge over growing signs of a two-speed global economy where a robust United States outpaces its peers. Just before noon the Euro STOXX 600 was down 0.1 percent. British shares were off 0.2 percent while the German and French markets were flat and 0.2 percent down respectively. Amid uncertainty on China’s prospects, investors in Europe focused on data that could offer clues to the health of their own region’s economy. The euro gained a quarter of a percentage point after figures showed growth in the euro zone grew more than expected in the first quarter, a fillip after poor manufacturing inflation data last month. German consumer inflation data is due at 1200 GMT. Inflation in the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria nudged up, data released ahead of the nationwide figures showed. Inflation in the euro zone is the key issue for the bloc’s policymakers, said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. “Unemployment is down, wages are starting to edge higher but inflation remains very subdued,” he said. “That is the biggest problem for the European Central Bank in terms of its policy response in trying to lift demand in the euro area.” France earlier reported steady growth for the first quarter, while Spain’s economy also grew faster than expected. Beyond economic data, corporate earnings were another major factor on Monday. Chipmaker AMS  jumped 16 percent after beating forecasts for first-quarter profit. AMS is a supplier to Apple, which is due to report its results later. Banks dragged heavily on the STOXX 600. Danske Bank, hit by money-laundering scandals, fell more than 6 percent after lowering its outlook for 2019, while No. 1 euro zone bank Santander also slipped after a drop in first-quarter net profit. In contrast, Standard Chartered climbed 4 percent after unveiling plans for share buybacks of up to $1 billion, its first in at least 20 years. Asian markets had fallen earlier on the Chinese data, albeit in thin trading. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.5 percent. Bourses in South Korea and Hong Kong also fell. Japan’s financial markets are closed this week as Japanese Emperor Akihito prepares to abdicate. Crown Prince Naruhito, Akihito’s elder son, will take the Chrysanthemum Throne on Wednesday. MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, ticked up 0.1 percent. Wall Street futures gauges were flat or marginally down. Germany’s 10-year government bond yield rose to a one-week high after the positive euro zone growth data and regional inflation figures, breaking above zero percent. And as the euro gained ground, FX traders were focused on whether European data would push currencies out of recent trading ranges. Even marginal growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. “The data offers some relief to traders, though it is still too early to say if the economic risks have completely lifted,” said Commerzbank FX strategist Esther Maria Reichelt. Analysts had warned that markets could dial back predictions of an interest rate increase by the European Central Bank next year if the data was weak. The Chinese data fuelled gains in Japan’s yen, which rallied to a three-week high in holiday-thinned trading. Against a basket of currencies the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 97.845 ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged as it seeks to balance robust economic growth against low inflation. In commodity markets, oil prices rose 1 percent after Saudi Arabia said a deal between producers to withhold output could be extended beyond June to cover the whole of 2019. Brent crude futures were last at $72.72 a barrel in late morning, up 0.9 percent.

836,Big banks break away from lobby groups in Brexit trade deal talks - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  11:44 AM / in 7 days","5 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - A group of banks are directly feeding the British government ideas for a Brexit financial services trade deal, bypassing the industry’s major lobby groups after their blueprint for a future relationship with the EU was spurned by Brussels last year. The finance ministry has asked global banks - including Citi and Goldman Sachs - to come up with ideas that could be slotted into a broader UK trade deal with the EU to cover financial services, people familiar with the process said. “A consortium of banks are looking  at this, at what could be workable past Brexit,” one person said. Banks liaising directly with the government contrasts with the financial industry’s lobbying last year, when asset managers, insurers and banks put on a united front to propose a “mutual recognition” system under which Britain and the European Union would broadly accept each other’s financial rules as a basis for cross-border trading after Brexit. But the government, having expressed support for mutual recognition, ditched the proposal at the last minute after it became clear that Brussels had no interest in an untested form of financial services trade. After that setback, big banks are taking matters into their own hands, working separately from the lobby groups and other parts of the industry. They have hired consultants to come up with practical ways to make the EU’s existing equivalence system of financial market access more workable.  “It’s a case of once bitten, twice shy,” a second banking source close to the situation said. Faced with differing priorities across the sector, it could be harder for the finance ministry to fashion a coherent trade proposal without creating winners and losers. A finance ministry spokesman said the government’s “white paper” report on future EU trade relations published last July referred to seeking an improved version of equivalence. “Obviously we have an ongoing dialogue with financial services firms on this and many other matters. This is a valuable but routine part of the process of developing policy,” the spokesman said. Under equivalence, Brussels decides if the home rules of a foreign bank, insurer or trading platform are “equivalent” or aligned enough to those in the EU to grant market access. But the financial sector is split, with big wholesale banks keen for Britain to stay aligned with the EU to avoid duplication of rules. This, however, could turn Britain into a “rule taker”, having to continually copy EU regulation to maintain access, a step UK regulators have warned against. Insurers want to ditch parts of the bloc’s Solvency II capital rules, which would make it hard to maintain equivalence. The Association of British Insurers said that being a long-term rule-taker would be a wholly unacceptable risk for the sector. Britain’s retail banks are “somewhere in the middle”, wanting some rules made less onerous for domestic-focused lenders, bankers said. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, one of the lobby groups behind last year’s mutual recognition blueprint, said it was now for individual sectors and companies in some cases to set out their own priorities as it was now clear that a one-size-fits-all template was not viable. “It’s meaningless to try and create some sort of artificial unanimity. It just isn’t there and it would not be taken very seriously. It’s absolutely right that it’s for the Treasury to try and make appropriate trade offs, but industry would expect to be sighted,” Celic said. But other senior finance industry officials said a price would be paid for failing to find common ground. “It is clear that we need a single voice. If we are leaving, we need a way out that helps the UK. We must forget the self-serving crap – everyone’s future is at stake here,” one said. The EU is Britain’s biggest financial services customer, with exports worth about 26 billion pounds ($33.6 billion) a year in mostly wholesale business. The EU has no set timetable for making equivalence determinations, not all financial activities are covered, and Brussels can cut off access at short notice. Bankers are looking for ways to make the process more predictable, such as having consultations if either side proposes new rules that could jeopardize equivalence. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority, said last week it would be “dangerous” for Britain to seek equivalence without such “rules of the game”. Industry expectations on access are tempered after the mutual recognition setback, and the fact a trade deal could be years away in practice.  Brexit has already prompted Brussels to make equivalence harder to obtain in areas like derivatives clearing. “There is no way the UK will get access that is superior to what the Swiss or the United States get, but there is an appetite in the EU to improve the process,” a banker said.

837,Trump rejects idea of expanding U.S. Supreme Court - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  6:36 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out the idea of expanding the nine-member U.S. Supreme Court, using a question about “court packing” to criticize Democrats in a preview of a likely attack line for the 2020 election. Trump said he “wouldn’t entertain that,” when asked about expanding the size of the court at a news conference.  “The only reason they’re doing that is they want to try to catch up, so if they can’t catch up through the ballot box by winning an election they want to try doing it in a different way,” the Republican president added, referring to Democrats. Trump has appointed conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch to the court since taking office in 2017, cementing its 5-4 conservative majority. Supreme Court justices are appointed for lifetime terms, and both his appointees potentially could serve for decades. In response to Trump’s appointments, a handful of liberal activists have argued that if Democrats win the White House in the November 2020 presidential election, they should expand the number of Supreme Court justices to tip the balance of control toward liberals. When asked, some candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination have said they would consider adding more justices to the court or other reforms. However, they have not made it a central part of their policy proposals, and other Democrats have opposed such an idea. Long-shot liberal candidate Pete Buttigieg has mentioned a Supreme Court composed of 15 justices that implements other reforms to ensure partisan parity. Trump’s pledge to place conservative justices on the court was a key campaign promise. Republicans have found that talking about the court galvanizes their conservative political case, given the court’s influence over contentious issues including abortion, gay rights and immigration policy. The composition of the Supreme Court also is a major issue for liberals. When Trump was elected in 2016, there was a court vacancy because of the death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia and the Republican-led Senate’s refusal to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland. Some Democrats have accused Republicans of “stealing” a seat, pointing to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s move to block consideration of Garland and keep the position vacant until the following year so the next president could make the appointment. McConnell’s action, with little precedent in U.S. history, enabled Trump to nominate Gorsuch in 2017, with the Republican-led Senate voting to confirm him. Expanding the court - by either party - would be difficult.  Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937 proposed expanding it to as many as 15 justices. Critics accused him of a “court-packing” scheme aimed at changing its ideological composition. The proposal went nowhere in Congress.

838,Trump renews attack alleging social media's political bias - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  2:19 PM / 2 months ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused social media platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter of favoring his Democratic opponents over him and his fellow Republicans.  “But fear not, we will win anyway, just like we did before! #MAGA,” he said in a tweet. MAGA refers to Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc declined to comment. Alphabet Inc’s Google, which owns YouTube, did not immediately comment. The president and other conservatives have repeatedly complained that these big tech platforms treat them unfairly.  Trump has previously accused Twitter of restricting the visibility of prominent U.S. Republicans, without any providing evidence, and the avid social media user has promised to investigate the company’s practices. Trump and other conservatives say Twitter targets fellow Republicans with a practice dubbed “shadow banning,” limiting the visibility of a Twitter user, including in the platform’s auto-populated dropdown search box.  Representative Devin Nunes of California has sued Twitter over the alleged practice, according to court documents.  Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has said that algorithms have been changed to fix that issue. The Justice Department held a meeting last fall between federal officials and state attorneys general to discuss allegations that conservative ideas are suppressed online, but so far no concrete action has been taken as a result.

839,"Trump asks why Facebook blocked Dan Scavino, his social media director - Reuters","March 19, 2019 /  4:01 PM / in 2 months","2 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will look into Facebook’s decision to block public comments by White House social media director Dan Scavino. Scavino posted a screen shot late on Monday of a message from Facebook saying he was temporarily blocked from making public comments because some of his comments had been reported as spam.  Facebook said the issue was an “unintended consequence” of the platform’s policy on spam, adding, it has been in touch with  Scavino and has apologized to him.  Explaining the error, Facebook said it caps the amount of identical, repetitive activity coming from one account in a short period of time as to stop automated bots. “These limits can have the unintended consequence of temporarily preventing real people like Dan Scavino from engaging in such activity, but lift in an hour or two, which is what happened in this case,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “Dear Facebook—AMAZING. WHY ARE YOU STOPPING ME from replying to comments followers have left me - on my own Facebook Page!!?? People have the right to know. Why are you silencing me??? Please LMK!” Scavino said in his post earlier. Trump pounced on the issue. “I will be looking into this!” Trump said in a Twitter post. Facebook said the issue is “content-agnostic and is solely about addressing potentially scammy repetitive behavior.” On Tuesday, Trump also said that social media platforms including Twitter discriminated against members of his party, and accused the companies of collusion. “We enforce the Twitter Rules dispassionately and equally for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation,” a Twitter spokeswoman said.

China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 50.1 in April from 50.5 in March, below expectations that the PMI would be unchanged from March’s reading. It pointed to continued but modest expansion despite a flurry of support measures. A reading above 50 indicates activity expanded. A private business survey also showed China’s factory activity cooled in April as export orders and employment decreased. The Caixin/Markit PMI fell to 50.2 from 50.8 in March, below expectations for a rise to 51.0. Benchmark copper edged down 0.1 percent to $6,388 a tonne by 0739 GMT, while the most active copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) ended up 0.1 percent to 48,930 yuan ($7,259) a tonne. “PMI is below expectation but still in the expansion zone. We’re not too worried about this because if you expand too much the government may scale back stimulus,” said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities. “China really does not want to see a super fast growth. They want to see a moderate growth,” Lau said. * PRICES: London aluminium fell 0.5 percent, while nickel edged down 0.1 percent, zinc decreased 0.5 percent and lead was down 0.7 percent. * SHANGHAI PRICES: The most active aluminium contract in Shanghai was almost flat at 14,175 yuan a tonne, nickel ended 0.2 percent lower while zinc closed up 0.9 percent. * SHANGHAI STOCKS: Aluminium stocks in warehouses tracked by the ShFE AL-STX-SGH dropped to 621,907 tonnes by Tuesday, its lowest since October 2017, while copper and zinc stocks CU-STX-SGH ZN-STX-SGH also fell. * GLENCORE: Commodities trader Glencore lowered its full-year production target for copper on Tuesday as it reported a 7 percent drop in first-quarter output for the metal, hurt in part by severe flooding in Australia. * NORSK HYDRO: Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro said a March cyber attack that paralysed its computer networks would cost the company up to 450 million Norwegian crowns ($52 million) in the first quarter. * CHALCO: Aluminum Corp of China Ltd , known as Chalco, said its aluminium production fell by 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, underlining the impact low aluminium prices are having on its operations. * RUSAL: Sales of value added products in the first quarter of United Company Rusal Plc, the world’s top aluminium producer outside China, fell 44 percent from a year ago due to sanctions by the United States. * TRADE TALKS: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he hopes to make “substantial progress” with Chinese negotiators as he arrived in Beijing for further rounds of trade talks to end the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. * CHINA HOLIDAY: China Labour Holiday runs from May 1 to 3. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or Three month LME copper Most active ShFE copper Three month LME aluminium Most active ShFE aluminium Three month LME zinc Most active ShFE zinc Three month LME lead Most active ShFE lead Three month LME nickel Most active ShFE nickel Three month LME tin Most active ShFE tin ARBS ($1 = 6.7406 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Mai Nguyen; Editing by Rashmi Aich and Christian

844,PRECIOUS-Gold gains as disappointing China data bruises Asia stocks - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  3:42 AM / in 7 days","3 Min Read* China PMI in April at 50.1 vs 50.5 in March * Markets await FOMC meeting due to commence later on Tuesday * Palladium near 2-wk low (Updates prices) By Arijit Bose April 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Tuesday as lacklustre Chinese factory activity data sent Asian shares lower, rekindling concerns about the health of the global economy. Investors now await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting starting later in the day for clues on the interest rate outlook. Spot gold rose 0.3 percent to $1,283.44 per ounce at 0731 GMT. U.S. gold futures were up 0.3 percent at $1,285.30 an ounce. “There is a broad bearish sentiment across Asia market opening this morning as a very disappointing China manufacturing PMI triggered a sell-off in currencies and emerging markets and equity markets,” said Margaret Yang, an analyst with CMC Markets in Singapore. Reading on the official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing unexpectedly fell to 50.1 in April from March’s reading of 50.5 stoking concerns about the economic state of China and pressuring Asian equities lower. Gold is generally used by investors as a safe-haven investment against economic and political concerns. The metal has, however, come under pressure of late as equity markets have hit record highs and most economic data from far and wide have pacified anxieties about the pace of global growth. Gold is yet to overcome the bearish factors, and any rallies in the metal might will be short-lived, INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said in a note. “We do not recommend establishing length at current levels on gold, given the lack of upside drivers. Although the dollar is not moving higher on the back of strong macro readings, it is not coming down either; neither are the U.S. long-term rates,” Meir added. The metal had retreated from a more than one-week high hit on Monday after Wall Street stocks were propelled to a record high by data showing U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March. The technical trend has turned more bearish for gold, CMC Markets’ Yang said. Investors now await a raft of economic data from the euro zone and will also focus on the commencement of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that will determine the future trajectory of interest rates in the United States. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates steady as policymakers balance recent stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth against sluggish inflation. Elsewhere, silver gained 0.3 percent to $14.95 per ounce, while platinum rose 0.4 percent to $897.25. Palladium, on the other hand, fell percent 0.4 percent to $1,365.50 an ounce. The metal had slumped over 7 percent to a two-week trough at $1,261.50 on Monday.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged lower by 0725 GMT. Most major indices fell except London’s FTSE 100 , which was little changed. China’s manufacturing activity failed to meet expectations, underscoring weakness in the world’s second-largest economy. In contrast, French economic growth held steady in the first quarter and Spain’s preliminary gross domestic product beat expectations. Investors now are waiting for economic growth data for the euro zone later in the day. Banks were the biggest weight on the STOXX 600. Danske Bank, caught up in a money-laundering scandals, fell more than 6 percent after lowering its outlook for 2019. Santander, the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, also slipped after first-quarter net profit. Nordea Bank and BBVA also reported lower profits and fell more than 2 percent each. Standard Chartered, however, advanced after the bank announced plans for up to $1 billion of share buybacks, its first in at least 20 years. Airbus slipped after the European planemaker reported a heavy drain on cash, which overshadowed slightly higher-than-expected core first-quarter profits. Rising fuel costs and excess capacity in Europe dragged German airline Lufthansa into a first-quarter loss. The stock shed 3 percent. Among the bright spots, chipmaker AMS jumped 16 percent, boosting the tech index, after it beat forecasts for first-quarter profit and gave an upbeat outlook for the second quarter. An Apple supplier, the AMS results came before Apple’s on quarterly report, due late on Tuesday. The world’s top maker of semiconductors, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, reported weak quarterly profit but forecast a recovery in demand in the second half of the year.

847,Airbus keeps targets after Saudi writedown takes shine off earnings - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:48 AM / in 7 days","3 Min ReadPARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus stuck to full-year financial targets after reporting slightly higher-than-expected core first-quarter profit, overshadowed by weaker cash and charges related to a German ban on defense exports to Saudi Arabia. The results are the first presented by new Chief Executive Guillaume Faury and finance chief Dominik Asam, who both pointed to strong demand for the A320neo jet while dismissing any expectations of a benefit from the Boeing  737 MAX crisis. Germany said last month it would extend a ban on exporting arms to Saudi Arabia, straining ties with fellow European arms exporters including France, where Airbus is based. The export ban has further snagged a long-delayed Saudi border security contract. “We are handcuffed and cannot complete the Saudi export contract as planned,” Asam told analysts, adding that Airbus  would continue talks with Saudi Arabia. Airbus took a charge of 190 million euros ($212.52 million)related to the contract, with foreign exchange charges bringing the total Saudi-related writedown to 297 million euros. Quarterly revenues rose 24 percent from a year ago to 12.55 billion euros, while adjusted operating profit jumped to 549 million euros from 14 million last year, driven by higher jetliner deliveries following earlier A320neo delays. Airbus shares rose 0.4 percent in early trading. A Reuters poll had anticipated revenues of 12.99 billion euros and an adjusted operating profit of 520 million. After the Saudi charge and a smaller one for the A380, which is set to end production, core profit fell 9 percent. Higher deliveries of A320neo jets, which sell at a premium to earlier models, and progress in reducing costs on the larger A350 contributed to the sharp rise in profit. But Airbus still faces snags in producing a longer-range A321 with new cabins.  Faury deflected repeated questions about the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX in the wake of two fatal crashes but downplayed prospects that it would open a new gap for Airbus. Output of the A320neo is determined for now by the capacity of a flat-out supply chain, and Airbus has no plans to alter its 2021 output goal of 63 aircraft a month, Faury said.  Airbus, which recently canceled informal plans to raise output to 70 a month after starting to market jets at that rate, will carry out a review of supplier capacity later this year. Asked whether Airbus stood to gain from concerns expressed by some airlines about the competing 737 MAX, Faury said the medium-term and long-term picture for the A320 had not changed. “The A320 is the A320 and the MAX is the MAX,” he said. Airbus suffered a cash outflow of 4.3 billion euros in the quarter as it built inventories to copy with delays but the company expects to see that reverse course later this year.  It reaffirmed 2019 targets, including positive free cashflow of 4 billion euros and a 15 percent rise in operating profit.

France’s economy, the second largest in the euro area, grew 0.3 percent in the January-March period, the third quarter in a row at that rate, preliminary data showed. It was in line with market expectations. Spain’s economy, the fourth biggest in the currency bloc, expanded a stronger-than-expected 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year. Signs of some stabilisation in the euro area economy helped offset the weaker tone overnight from China, where readings on manufacturing activity failed to meet expectations. In early Tuesday trade, 10-year bond yields across the single currency bloc were flat to marginally higher on the day . Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield rose above zero percent to trade at 0.002 percent, but held below one-month highs hit earlier this month. Inflation data from German states, released ahead of the countrywide number later this session, was also in focus. Data from Saxony showed consumer price inflation in the German state rose 1.9 percent in April from a year earlier. “The focus is on the inflation numbers which were weak last month,” said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities in London. “Given the fact that tomorrow is a holiday in much of Europe and we have the Fed meeting, volumes are light,” she said, referring to a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that concludes on Wednesday.

850,Ex-U.S. Attorney Bharara to Trump: don't mess with Manhattan probes - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  10:18 AM / 2 months ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - Preet Bharara, the ex-U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, has a piece of unsolicited advice for President Donald Trump: don’t meddle with investigations being pursued by his former office, especially one involving the Trump business or a family member. Any such attempt, Bharara predicted, would likely prompt Democrats in Congress to start the impeachment process. Bharara, who was fired as head of the office soon after Trump became president, wrote a book, “Doing Justice: A Prosecutor’s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment and the Rule of Law,” that goes on sale Tuesday. A recurring theme in the book is the reputation of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office – formally known as the Southern District of New York – for political neutrality and independence. The office’s willingness to pursue high-profile cases was confirmed with its prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, who pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance crimes which prosecutors say he carried out at the direction of Trump.    The office’s work is considered by many legal experts to be a bigger threat to Trump than Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, which is believed to be nearing its conclusion. Reuters asked Bharara what would happen if Trump ordered the Southern District to halt a probe, a prospect that may not be far-fetched given that Trump last year asked then-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker if Geoffrey Berman, Bharara’s  Trump-appointed successor, could be tapped to oversee the Cohen investigation, according to the New York Times. Berman is recused from the matter for undisclosed reasons. Bharara said if he were still U.S. attorney and received such an order he would resign and buy “a one-way ticket for the shuttle to D.C.” to testify before a congressional committee.  “And then, I think you set the timer on impeachment,” he said. “So I don’t think it would be a wise thing to do.” Trump has repeatedly criticized Mueller’s probe as a “witch hunt” pushed by Democrats who want to impeach him. He has called Cohen a “rat,” accusing him of lying to prosecutors to try and reduce his sentence of three years in prison due to start in May Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, did not respond to requests for comment. Unlike the special counsel, the Southern District has wide latitude to pursue cases with some connection to New York. In addition to Cohen, it is looking at Trump’s inaugural committee and the business practices at Trump’s real estate firm. Bharara’s book is not about Trump but he acknowledges the president “infuses the book like he infuses everyone’s life at the moment” even if he is not cited frequently by name. The book instead centers on a variety of both high-profile and lesser known cases to illustrate his views on how the justice system should work and when it falls short. He addressed a frequent criticism of his tenure - that his and other agencies failed to prosecute bankers for the financial crisis. He wrote that holding people accountable was difficult because “much of what happened in 2008 was not the product of a few people with clear, provable intent.” He pushed back at the notion that politics, bias or other considerations blunted his response to the crisis, noting that the Southern District prosecuted hedge fund executives and New York politicians from both major parties during his time there. “I’m more than willing to accept credible criticism on behalf of the law enforcement community, but the idea that self-interest or politics or fear was a factor is a silly criticism, at least at SDNY,” he wrote.

851,Senior prosecutor departs U.S. special counsel's team: media - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  6:00 AM / 2 months ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - A senior prosecutor has departed special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s team, the latest to exit the investigation, media reports said. The move comes amid widespread speculation that Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election is nearing an end. Zainab Ahmad, a leading Mueller prosecutor who oversaw the investigation of former national security advisor and Trump campaign aide Michael Flynn, has left Mueller’s team, a Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said Tuesday, according to Yahoo News. “Zainab Ahmad has concluded her detail with the Special Counsel’s Office but will continue to represent the office on specific pending matters that were assigned to her during her detail,” Carr said in statement, Yahoo News reported. Last week, Carr announced that another of top prosecutor, Andrew Weissman, will soon leave his post. Weissmann, who orchestrated the prosecution of Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort, will leave the special counsel’s team “in the near future,” Carr recently said. Manafort was sentenced by a federal judge in Washington, bringing his total punishment to 7-1/2 years in prison from two criminal cases brought by Mueller’s team, including financial fraud. Manafort was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a litany of financial and other crimes. In 2017 Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with a Russian ambassador, and he has not yet been sentenced. Officials could not be immediately reached for comment.

852,Trump to nominate Washington lawyer ambassador to Mexico: White House - Reuters,"March 19, 2019 /  4:48 AM / 2 months ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - President Donald Trump will nominate a Washington attorney, Christopher Landau, to be the next United States Ambassador to Mexico, the White House Press Office said on Monday. The nomination comes at a time of strained relations between the neighbors amid trade disputes, Trump’s complaints about undocumented immigrants crossing the border, and his efforts to build an extended border wall. Roberta Jacobson, the previous U.S. ambassador, stepped down in May, joining a list of senior U.S. State Department officials to resign during Trump’s presidency. Landau, now a partner at the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, and then for Justice Clarence Thomas, both considered court conservatives. The White House described Landau as a constitutional and appellate attorney who has briefed and argued appeals before the Supreme Court, Federal courts of appeals, and State appellate courts. He previously headed the appellate litigation practice at the firm of Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  In 2017, Landau served a three-year term as a member of the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules, the White House said. No formal diplomatic experience was mentioned in the White House statement, which said Landau is fluent in Spanish. Landau could not immediately be reached for comment.

853,FOREX-Yen gains on weak China data; European data eyed - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:17 AM / 7 days ago","2 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - The Japanese yen rallied to a three-week high on Tuesday as disappointing data on Chinese manufacturing undermined risk appetite, with investors waiting for European data to see if that will push currencies out of recent trading ranges. Forecasts are for a 0.3 percent rise in euro zone gross domestic product from the quarter before. That would be a bigger increase than the previous quarter and may be taken as a sign of stabilization. Even such marginal growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. “Any signs of consolidation in the German CPI data and the eurozone GDP figures may lead to some unwinding of the extended short positions in the euro, particularly on the crosses,” said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX research at Credit Agricole in London. But early trends in the currency markets were cautious after China’s official purchasing management index dipped to 50.1 April. Forecasts had been for no change from March’s 50.5 or an increase. Some of the favored currencies in a low-volatility environment such as the Australian dollar and the Aussie/Swiss franc fell 0.2 to 0.3 percent. Trading was thin with Japan on holiday, and set to get thinner on Wednesday when China and much of Europe will be off. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at 97.839. On a monthly basis, it was up 0.6 percent and on track for a third consecutive month of gains. The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday, remains a hurdle for the dollar. No change in policy is expected, but the market wants to hear how Chairman Jerome Powell resolves the divergence between solid economic growth and slowing inflation.

European equities were set to open mixed, with futures on London’s FTSE up 0.1 percent but those on the German DAX 0.1 percent lower. Both official and private business surveys pointed to slower Chinese factory growth this month, dashing hopes for a steady reading or even a faster expansion. Data also showed a slower expansion in its services sector, adding to economic uncertainty. The dollar-denominated MSCI index of Chinese shares dropped 0.4 percent. But shares in Shanghai tilted up 0.3 percent as investors maintained hopes for additional stimulus measures to prop up the economy. The weak manufacturing numbers suggest “stimulus is there to stay,” said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac. Upbeat Chinese data for March had prompted some analysts to scale back expectations of additional support measures. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.5 percent. Korean shares lost 0.3 percent, the Hong Kong market eased 0.4 percent, while stocks in Australia were down by 0.5 percent. “A lot of the stimulus measures undertaken by the Chinese authorities are focused domestically, such as VAT changes. They are not expected to have big spillovers” to the rest of Asia, Kerry Craig, Sydney-based global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. Japan’s financial markets remain closed for a national holiday as Japanese Emperor Akihito prepares to abdicate on Tuesday in favour of his elder son, Crown Prince Naruhito. Even before the China data, Asian investors had shrugged off cautious gains on Wall Street overnight that had lifted the S&P 500 index to an intraday record high of 2,949.52. The index finished up 0.11 percent at a record closing high of 2,943.03. The Nasdaq gained 0.19 percent to 8,161.85, also a record closing high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.04 percent to 26,554.39. Investors were also cautious ahead of a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is set to release its latest statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, as it seeks to balance robust economic growth against low inflation. In the latest slew of data sending mixed signals to the Fed, U.S. consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the bank’s favoured inflation measure, logged its smallest annual rise in 14 months. “We expect the dovish tone from central banks to continue for the foreseeable future. Given evidence of a recovery in growth, this is very positive for risk assets,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes was seen at 2.527 percent, stooping below Monday’s close of 2.536, on the strong consumer spending data. The two-year yield, watched as a gauge of expectations of rate rises, was at 2.2942 percent, off its last close of 2.298 percent. In the currency market, the dollar lost 0.1 percent against the yen to 111.51, and the euro was barely changed at $1.1186. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down less than 0.1 percent, holding at 97.808. While other currencies remained stable, the dollar jumped almost 0.5 percent against the Korean won, to 1,164.52. “The won is both risk- and trade-sensitive, and as such it is suffering,” said Cheung at Westpac. “Upward pressure on USD/Asia is likely to stay before we see some economic improvement (in China).” Oil prices turned lower, after edging higher on Monday as markets attempted to resume a rally interrupted by demands from U.S. President Donald Trump that OPEC raise output. U.S. crude fell 0.1 percent to $63.41 per barrel and Brent crude was down 0.3 percent at $71.83. Gold showed some lustre after dipping Tuesday on the U.S. data.

857,Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block House subpoenas - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:45 AM / 7 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and seven of his companies filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp to block the banks from complying with federal subpoenas investigating his financial dealings. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court’s Southern District of New York, contended that demands for records by Democrat-controlled House committees have no legitimate or lawful purpose. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the lawsuit said. It also complains that the Democrats are hoping “they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, both Democrats, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, the New York Times and other media reported. On April 15, two U.S. House of Representatives committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Both banks have been involved in Trump’s real estate empire. “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates, as thoroughly as possible,” Waters, said in a statement earlier. Schiff said previously in a statement the subpoenas issued included a “friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank.” Trump recently has said that he intends to defy any efforts from the Democrats to dig into his affairs. Among other things, the Democrats have been looking into possible dealings Trump might have with Russia. The suit, which includes The Trump Organization Inc. and Trump’s three eldest children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, states that the court has the power to declare the subpoenas invalid. A representative of Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Attorneys and representatives for the two sides were not immediately available to Reuters late Monday.

859,"FOREX-Dollar marks time, Aussie eases on China data miss - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  5:57 AM / 7 days ago","4 Min Read* China PMI dips to 50.1 in April, from 50.5 * Aussie dollar leads risk assets lower, major crosses quiet * EU to report first-quarter GDP later in the day By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 30 (Reuters) - The dollar held to tight ranges in holiday-thinned Asian trade on Tuesday, though its Australian counterpart eased as disappointing readings on Chinese manufacturing tempered hopes for a rapid rebound in global growth. China’s official purchasing management index (PMI) dipped to 50.1 April, when speculators had wagered on a steady outcome of 50.5 or even an improvement. A measure of services also disappointed with a pullback to 54.3. A private-sector survey was no better with the Caixin PMI easing to 50.2 in March, from 50.8. Still, the fallout was limited in part because investors assumed the numbers would encourage Beijing to continue with its stimulus measures. “These results are still well above the average seen over the past six months and don’t necessarily derail the ‘economic stabilisation’ narrative,” said Sue Trinh, head of Asia emerging market forex strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “That said, the data remain consistent with further policy support with speculation of targeted RRR (reserve requirements)cuts and structural reform in the pipeline.” The Aussie dollar suffered the most as it is often used as a liquid proxy for China plays given Australia is a major exporter of resources to the Asian giant. The currency eased to $0.7045 after the PMI release, from $0.7064, but soon steadied. The safe-haven yen got a lift, with the Aussie losing 0.4 percent to 78.59, while the dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 111.50 yen. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was off a fraction at 97.813 but not far from last week’s 23-month peak of 98.330. It was still 0.5 percent higher for the month. Trading was thin with Japan on holiday, and set to get thinner on Wednesday when China and much of Europe will be off. The euro was little moved at $1.1187 as investors await figures for economic growth in the common currency bloc due later in the session. Forecasts are for a modest rise of 0.3 percent in the first quarter, although that would still be faster than the previous quarter and may be taken as a sign of stabilisation. Even such tentative growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. A major hurdle for the dollar remains the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which ends on Wednesday with a statement and a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. No change in policy is expected but the market is keen to hear how Powell resolves the divergence between solid economic growth and slowing inflation. U.S. data overnight showed consumer spending enjoyed the sharpest rebound in 9-1/2 years in March, yet core inflation still slowed to a 14-month low. The core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s favoured measure of inflation, slowed to 1.6 percent and further away from the central bank’s 2 percent target. “A sustained acceleration in core inflation remains elusive and is contributing to low inflation expectations,” said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett. “This is not just an issue for the FOMC, it is a real concern for other major central banks.” “We expect the dovish tone from central banks to continue for the foreseeable future,” she added. “Given evidence of a recovery in growth, this is very positive for risk assets.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill and Sam Holmes)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

860,German chauffeur service Blacklane plans IPO within three years - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  12:25 PM / 7 days ago","2 Min ReadDUBAI (Reuters) - German chauffeur service Blacklane is planning an initial public offering (IPO) in the next three years, its chief executive told Reuters, as it strives to build its position in the fast-growing premium taxi market.  Any flotation would follow those of larger ride-hailing rivals. U.S. group Lyft listed last month with a valuation of $24.3 billion, while Uber is planning an IPO that values the company at $80.5-$91.5 billion. “This would be a natural evolution of our business model and our traction to IPO in the next years to come. That’s pretty realistic,” Blacklane CEO Jens Wohltorf said in an interview on the sidelines of a tourism fair in Dubai. He declined to provide any details. Blacklane, which competes with the likes of British premium car service Addison Lee and UberBLACK, the ride-hailing app’s luxury arm, caters to business customers in 300 cities in 60 countries.  Uber, by comparison, says it is available in more than 600 cities worldwide. Blacklane is expanding into 20 cities in the Middle East this year, including Cairo, Wohltorf said.  It will invest $10-$20 million in the expansion, financed by the company and its shareholders, which include German premium carmaker Daimler AG and Abu Dhabi-based Al Fahim Group, he added.  Wohltorf said Blacklane’s core driver service was profitable, but that overall the company was not because it was expanding in areas such as airport express services.    “If we decide we don’t want to grow one hundred and twenty percent year over year anymore, but slower, we could immediately turn it around,” he said.  Blacklane currently does around half of its business in Europe, with about a third in the United States and the rest in the Middle East and Asia.

863,O'Rourke candidacy asks: Can a moderate white male win the 2020 Democratic primary? - Reuters,"March 17, 2019 /  10:22 AM / 2 months ago","6 Min ReadMOUNT VERNON, Iowa (Reuters) - As he had done at several stops in his first campaign trip as a presidential candidate, Beto O’Rourke on Friday climbed atop a counter at a local Iowa business and addressed a small but adoring crowd. People clapped and cheered. Outside, some waited in the cold, hoping to catch a glimpse of him.   By that measure, his tour across eastern Iowa last week was largely a success. But by no means was O’Rourke considered a front-runner. And that underscored the challenge he faces as he competes for the 2020 Democratic nomination.  O’Rourke, a former three-term U.S. congressman from Texas, became a celebrity last year when his longshot bid to unseat U.S. Senator Ted Cruz drew national attention and a torrent of money. But ultimately, his fame was not enough.  That loss led some critics to wonder why someone who couldn’t secure a Senate seat would then think he should run for president. That is not his only obstacle. O’Rourke, 46, is a wealthy, white man from a conservative-leaning state who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors. Given the energy among progressives in the early stages of the race and the diversity of the Democratic field, O’Rourke would appear to be everything that many in the party say they do not want.  More than a dozen Democrats have declared their candidacy to take on President Donald Trump in next year’s election, including six women. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination. Julian Castro, a former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be the first Hispanic to do so. Another contender, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is openly gay.  O’Rourke also must grapple with the enduring popularity of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive who remains a formidable adversary after battling Hillary Clinton in 2016, and former Vice President Joe Biden, who is weighing a presidential bid.  Even so, none of them are on the cover of the latest issue of Vanity Fair, as O’Rourke is. His interview with the magazine sparked controversy on social media last week when he said he was “born” to run for president. Critics also found fault with his oft-repeated joke on the trail about how he “helps” raise his three children with his wife, Amy.  To his detractors, it smacked of white male privilege. O’Rourke grew up affluent, attended the Ivy League’s Columbia University, and married the daughter of a real estate baron. His estimated net personal wealth is more than $9 million.  His image in his race against Cruz, however, belied that background. He fashioned himself as the scrappy underdog, a former punk rocker who was battling the establishment, visiting every county in Texas in a Dodge minivan and holding numerous town halls where he fielded questions from the public. Reuters reported on Friday that when he was a teenager, O’Rourke was a member of the oldest group of computer hackers in U.S. history, the Cult of the Dead Cow, posing a question whether the United States is ready for a presidential contender who in his youth stole long-distance phone service and engaged in human-rights-driven “hacktivism.” He took his outsider strategy to Iowa last week, going so far as to rent another Dodge minivan that he drove himself and shooting a fundraising video on Facebook of him filling its gas tank. O’Rourke differed from many of his liberal competitors by talking frequently about how he worked with Republicans in Congress to improve care for veterans in his home town of El Paso, Texas. Asked whether he was a true “progressive,” he referenced President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican.  O’Rourke maintained that his campaign would be relentlessly optimistic – and he only rarely rebuked Trump. “We will not belittle or demean or vilify other candidates,” he said in Mt. Vernon. “We will not define ourselves in contrast to others or say who we are against.” His policy positions were largely nonspecific. He championed universal health care, immigration reform and combating climate change, but largely said any reforms would have to be pragmatic and incremental.  Occasionally, O’Rourke showed self-awareness of his status as a wealthy, white male, telling crowds that he had been given opportunities denied to minorities and describing the U.S. economic system as imperfect and racist. He also found that despite the media attention he has received, he was not a household name in Iowa. “I didn’t even know who he was until two days ago,” said Sam Jennison, the owner of the bar in Mount Vernon where O’Rourke held his event. But for the most part, those who attended his events spoke of him glowingly and dismissed concerns about whether he was progressive enough. “Issues are very important,” said Cathryn Layer, 65, of New London, Iowa. “Winnability is another thing.” “We need a moderate Democrat, and we probably need a white male because that is not threatening to a lot of people,” said Holly Manon Moore, 65, of Fairfield, Iowa, who said she is undecided in the race and would want a person of color to be the vice-presidential nominee. “If we go too far left, we’re going to lose.” At the close of his Iowa trip, it remained unclear how O’Rourke’s entrance would reshape the Democratic race. He notably declined to reveal how much money he raised in his first few days as a candidate.  But he did have an impact. At the same time O’Rourke was in eastern Iowa, so was one of his competitors, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And while the size of the crowd that came to see her on Saturday was comparable to those at O’Rourke’s events, there were far fewer journalists present.

864,Senator Gillibrand formally launches presidential campaign - Reuters,"March 17, 2019 /  11:13 AM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand formally launched her presidential bid on Sunday morning, announcing she will deliver her first major speech next week in front of Trump International Hotel in New York City.  Gillibrand, who launched an exploratory committee earlier this year as a precursor, joins more than a dozen other Democrats who have already formally entered the contest to win the nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. “We need a leader who makes big, bold, brave choices. Someone who isn’t afraid of progress,” Gillibrand says in a video released Sunday morning to formalize her entry into the campaign. “That’s why I’m running for president. And it’s why I’m asking you for your support.”  Gillibrand, 52, had already been campaigning in key states that hold early primary contests. She has struggled to see her polling numbers increase in the wake of her initial announcement, a benefit some of her other opponents enjoyed after starting their campaigns. Gillibrand remains at 1 percent in most public opinion polls of the Democratic primary.  Gillibrand opted to use a video instead of a speech at a rally, the traditional method, to formally launch her campaign. She will travel on Monday to campaign in Michigan, followed by stops in key early contest states of Iowa and Nevada.  On March 24, Gillibrand will deliver a launch speech in her home state in front of Trump International Hotel in New York City, to take “her positive, brave vision of restoring America’s moral integrity straight to President Trump’s doorstep,” her campaign said. The launch video released Sunday morning alludes to several policy debates, including immigration, gun control and climate change.  “We launched ourselves into space and landed on the moon. If we can do that, we can definitely achieve universal health care,” Gillibrand said in the video. “We can provide paid family leave for all, end gun violence, pass a Green New Deal, get money out of politics and take back our democracy.” Gillibrand has sought to position herself as a unifying figure who can appeal to rural voters.  Some in the Democratic party believe an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters is the way to victory. Others argue a fresh face, and particularly a diverse one, is needed to energize the party’s increasingly left-leaning base. Gillibrand was a member of the centrist and fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition while in the House of Representatives. Her positions became more liberal after she was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton in New York when Clinton became former President Barack Obama’s secretary of state.  Gillibrand then won the seat in a special election and was re-elected to six-year terms in 2012 and 2018. She has attributed the ideology shift to representing a liberal state versus a more conservative district. As a senator, Gillibrand was outspoken about rape in the military and campus sexual assault years before the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and assault first arose in 2017. In late 2017, as she pushed for a bill changing how Congress processes and settles sexual harassment allegations made by staffers, some prominent party leaders criticized her for being the first Democratic senator to urge the resignation of Senator Al Franken, who was accused of groping and kissing women without their consent. During the same period, Gillibrand said Hillary Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, should have resigned from the White House after his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment by the House. Some criticized the senator for attacking the Clintons, who had supported her political career. Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Nick ZieminskiAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

865,Backstory: How Reuters uncovered Beto O'Rourke's teenage hacking days - Reuters,"March 16, 2019 /  2:44 AM / 2 months ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Reuters reporter Joseph Menn exclusively revealed on Friday that Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke belonged to one of the best-known groups of computer hackers as a teenager.  Within minutes, his special report was the most popular story on Reuters.com here and was picked up by other news outlets. But the origin of the story goes back more than two years.  Members of the group, which calls itself Cult of the Dead Cow, protected O’Rourke’s secret for decades, reluctant to compromise the former Texas Congressman’s political career.  After more than a year of reporting, Menn persuaded O’Rourke to talk on the record. In an interview in late 2017, O’Rourke acknowledged that he was a member of the group, on the understanding that the information would not be made public until after his Senate race against Ted Cruz in November 2018.  In an interview with Reuters senior producer Jane Lee, Menn explains how he broke the story and got O’Rourke to open up about his hacking days.  “I decided to write a book about the Cult of the Dead Cow because they were the most interesting and influential hacking group in history. They illustrated a lot of the things that I think are fascinating about hacking and security work. “While I was looking into the Cult of the Dead Cow, I found out that they had a member who was sitting in Congress. I didn’t know which one. But I knew that they had a member of Congress. “And then I figured out which one it was. And the members of the group wouldn’t talk to me about who it was. They wouldn’t confirm that it was this person unless I promised that I wouldn’t write about it until after the November election. That’s because the member of Congress had decided to run for Senate. Beto O’Rourke is who it was. “I met Beto O’Rourke. I said ‘I’m writing a book about Cult of the Dead Cow, I think it’s really interesting. I know you were in this group. This book is going to publish after November and your Senate race is over. And he said, ‘OK.’ “And he told me about his time in the Cult of the Dead Cow.” Menn explains more about the story on Twitter @josephmenn twitter.com/josephmenn Reporting by Jane Lee in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Rigby and Ben KellermanAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Faraday, which has ambitions to overtake Tesla Inc, said in November that it was exploring strategic options, including debt and equity financing, amid a legal fight with Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd which has since ended. The company said in a statement on its website that it had signed the agreement with Birch Lake Associates, with parts of the financing also set to be used to pay around 60 percent of the suppliers to which it owes money.  The company also said it had launched a $1.25 billion equity capital-raising program with Stifel Nicolaus & Co as advisor.

869,China Big Five banks post modest profit growth amid loan push - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:48 PM / 7 days ago","4 Min ReadBEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s five biggest state-owned banks posted a modest growth in quarterly profit as policymakers pushed them to make more loans, but the results still missed expectations amid the lingering impact of an economic slowdown. Net profits at the country’s so-called Big Five banks, led by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC), grew by more than 4 percent in the January-March quarter from a year earlier. The gain comes on the heels of disappointing 2018 fourth quarter when four of the five turned in their weakest profit growth in more than two years as business activity slowed and they sharply increased provisions for bad loans. March data, however, suggests the economy may be starting to bottom out, buoyed by stimulus measures ranging from higher infrastructure spending to massive corporate tax cuts.  Profits at China’s industrial firms also returned to growth in March after shrinking for four months, adding to optimism that strains on corporate balance sheets may be easing in at least some sectors. China’s economy grew last year at its slowest pace since 1990, partially due to the trade war and Beijing’s crackdown on financial risks, which raised corporate borrowing costs. ICBC, the world’s top commercial lender by assets, on Monday posted a 4.1 percent rise in profit to 82.01 billion yuan ($12.17 billion), its fastest first-quarter growth since 2014. Bank of Communications (BoCom), the fifth-largest in China, booked its fastest quarterly growth in five years with a 4.9 percent rise to 21.07 billion yuan. Analysts had expected ICBC and BoCom to report profit growth of 4.3 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.    Non-performing loan (NPL) ratios fell at ICBC, BoCom and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd, and held steady at China Construction Bank Ltd (CCB) and Bank of China Ltd (BoC).  The pressure on asset quality of banks has marginally eased due to a stabilizing economy in the first quarter, and disposal of bad loans by lenders, said Nicholas Zhu, a Beijing-based banking analyst of Moody’s Investors Service. Some analysts, however, warn banks’ asset quality could come under pressure as they hike small business loans.  Smaller, private firms are considered higher credit risks than state-backed firms and more vulnerable to cyclical downturns. Analysts have also cautioned it is too early to say there has been a sustainable turnaround in the economy. “The formation of new NPLs can’t be taken lightly should the macroeconomic situation become less stable, so there’s a lingering concern for the asset quality,” Zhu said. Chinese banks extended a record amount of new credit in the first quarter, totaling 5.81 trillion yuan.  But the “front-loading” of loans during the quarter, with some hitting 40 percent of their annual targets, squeezed interest margins at some lenders, said Richard Xu, Morgan Stanley’s China banking analyst. Net interest margin (NIM), a key gauge of profitability, improved slightly at ICBC and BoCom but narrowed by 0.08 percentage points at BoC and 0.02 percentage points at CCB. NIMs at big banks will likely continue to narrow over 2019 due to relatively ample liquidity in the market, said Wang Jian, Shanghai-based banking analyst at Guosen Securities.  “Unless the economy picks up significantly, the central bank is not likely to tighten the liquidity condition,” Wang said. Shanghai-listed shares of four of the five banks dipped on Tuesday, including an about 0.3 percent decline for CCB and BOC as of midday. That compared with a nearly 0.2 percent rise in the benchmark, which tracks blue-chips listed on the mainland, according to Refinitiv data.

A spokeswoman for the Sydney-headquartered investment bank declined to comment on Tuesday on the closure of the equities business when contacted by Reuters. But, she said in a statement Macquarie would continue to operate a commodities hedging and trading business in Canada. “Macquarie remains committed to Canada, with more than 100 staff working across commodities trading and hedging, corporate finance and advisory ... in a range of sectors,” the spokeswoman said. The Canadian newspaper reported the bank would shut its institutional equity sales, trading and research units in that country, adding that between 50 to 80 staff were likely to be affected. The job cuts would mainly occur in Toronto and some in Calgary, but total job losses depended on how many back-office roles could be eliminated by the move, the newspaper said. Macquarie’s spokeswoman said the bank would “continue to provide domestic cash equities execution services and access to our global execution platform.” According to its February operational briefing, Macquarie operates in Toronto, Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver. It has ranked well below the top 20 banks in equity capital markets league tables Canada in recent years, Refinitiv data shows, well below local rivals Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, RBC Capital Markets, Bank of Montreal and Toronto-Dominion Bank.

875,IMF's Lagarde expects U.S. and China to reach trade deal - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  3:47 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Monday she expects the United States and China to reach a deal to end their trade dispute, which has unnerved financial markets and cast a shadow over the global economy. “I would say ‘Yes,’” Lagarde said at the Milken Institute Global Conference when asked whether talks between the world’s two largest economies would end in a deal. Washington and Beijing have been engaged for the past year in a trade war marked by tariffs on billions of dollars in goods and threats of escalation. The talks are now at a critical point. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was scheduled to speak at the conference on Monday but was headed to China instead for talks. Lagarde was the first speaker at the annual conference, which draws 4,000 attendees including some of the world’s most powerful thinkers and trendsetters to discuss finance, healthcare and other topics. Later on Monday, Blackstone Group LP Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman also said he was positive about the prospects for a U.S.-China deal, but cautioned it would not solve all the issues being disputed. “I’m positive that they will come up with something that works, but it will not be a trade deal that solves all problems for all people and moves China into the modern world,” he said.  “There’s a process of normalization that will take some period of time.”      Lagarde said in an interview she did not see the U.S. economy dipping into a recession, following last week’s news that it grew at a stronger-than-expected 3.2 percent annualized pace in the first three months of 2019.  Concerns have been mounting over a global slowdown, particularly in China and Europe, and the prospect that the decade-long U.S. bull market might be coming to an end. But the strong U.S. GDP growth data may prompt leaders to reassess the health of the economy, she said. Lagarde cautioned, however, that more data was necessary before making a more definite call.  Even as inflation has been largely in check, a situation she called “highly mysterious,” Lagarde said she expected price pressures to pick up “gradually and slowly” in the coming months, in part fueled by rising oil prices.  Asked if she would like to continue as IMF managing director after her current term ends in 2021, Lagarde said: “I’m looking at my options.” The former French politician was named IMF chief in 2011.

876,Few Americans see savings from Trump's tax reform: Reuters/Ipsos poll - Reuters,"March 15, 2019 /  10:09 AM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Only one in five U.S. taxpayers expects to pay less income tax this year as a result of the tax reform law passed in 2017 by Republicans who promised big savings for everyday Americans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Friday. The poll suggested that the tax overhaul, mostly geared to helping businesses, may not be as strong a 2020 campaign talking point as Republicans and President Donald Trump had hoped. The U.S. Treasury Department insisted that most Americans were paying lower taxes under the new law. Just prior to approval of the tax reform by the Republican-controlled Congress, Trump said, “This is going to be one of the great gifts to the middle-income people of this country that they’ve ever gotten for Christmas.” The tax overhaul temporarily lowered federal income tax rates for individuals and raised the standard deduction that people can use to reduce their taxable income. But it also capped certain deductions, such as for state and local taxes, that can be claimed by taxpayers who opt to itemize instead of taking the standard deduction. Historically, a majority of U.S. taxpayers have claimed the standard deduction on their federal tax bills.  The March 6-11 survey found about 21 percent of adults who had either filed their taxes or planned to said “the new tax plan that Congress recently passed” would let them pay less this year; about 29 percent said they would pay more; 27 percent said there would be no impact; 24 percent said they were not sure.  The responses differed along party lines, with Republican taxpayers more likely than others to expect a tax benefit.  According to the poll, about 33 percent of Republicans said they would pay less tax; 17 percent said they would pay more. Among Democrats, about 8 percent said they would pay less; about 45 percent said they would pay more. The $10,000 cap imposed on the deduction of state and local taxes, which was previously unlimited, has been seen having the greatest effect on taxpayers in high-tax states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California, which are all largely Democratic. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) “cut taxes across the board, particularly for middle-income Americans, as well as doubled the standard deduction, doubled the Child Tax Credit for families, and altered other deductions and credits. As a result, 80 percent of Americans are paying lower taxes ... and 15 percent of filers will pay about the same amount.” The Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,755 people, including 1,439 who said they either “already filed” or “will file” an income tax return. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 5 percentage points.

878,U.S. senators seek probe of Trump admin nuclear energy talks with Saudi Arabia - Reuters,"March 15, 2019 /  3:49 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. senator and his Republican counterpart on Friday asked Congress’ investigative arm to probe Trump administration talks with Saudi Arabia over sharing nuclear power technology. In the latest effort by lawmakers to shed light on the potential deal, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and Republican Senator Marco Rubio asked the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to investigate the talks as soon as possible. They also asked the GAO to review executive branch negotiations with Saudi Arabia on nuclear energy since 2009, when Democrat Barack Obama was president. Rubio and Menendez, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, want to ensure any agreement “includes rigorous nonproliferation safeguards and other conditions to prevent nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia from undermining or threatening regional or international security,” said their letter to the GAO, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to build at least two nuclear power plants, has been in talks with the United States for years on importing technology.  The OPEC member, which is also in talks with countries including Russia, China and France, has at times resisted U.S. standards on sharing nuclear technology that prevent uranium enrichment and spent fuel repossessing. Both of those techniques are potential paths to clandestinely making fissile material for nuclear weapons.  Nonproliferation experts worry that if Saudi Arabia is not held to such a “gold standard,” in what is known as a 123 agreement, it could risk a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates, which recently built reactors, could renegotiate its nonproliferation agreements if Saudi Arabia is allowed to bypass the standards.   Concerns in Congress rose last year after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News his kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if archrival Iran did. The killing of journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year has also sparked backlash against any deal. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has had quiet talks with Saudi officials, including his friend, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, on nuclear power.  The Department of Energy and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The senators said the negotiations are occurring in a “very opaque manner” and that the Trump administration is not keeping their committee informed.   Perry has said he told Saudi Arabia it is important for the kingdom to be seen around the world as strong on nonproliferation. He also said that part of the talks center on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive for sensitive areas in the kingdom.  Perry told the Financial Times this week that talks with Saudi Arabia were at a pace “closer to one mile an hour than to Mach 1.2.”  Last month, Democratic House members alleged in a report that top White House aides ignored warnings they could be breaking the law as they worked with former U.S. officials in a group called IP3 International to advance a multibillion-dollar plan to build nuclear reactors in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.

The quarterly result was also boosted by gains from the sale of Banorte USA, the bank said in a statement. Banorte’s current loan portfolio registered a year-on-year increase in the quarter of 22 percent to reach 762.10 billion pesos, amid growth in commercial, corporate and government lending. The bank’s past-due loan ratio, meanwhile, fell to 1.7 percent, from 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2018, according to the results.

880,Australian dollar slips as China data hits risk - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  12:08 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadSYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian dollar led risk assets lower in Asia on Tuesday after a survey on Chinese manufacturing missed forecasts in a blow to hopes for a rebound in global growth. China’s official purchasing management index (PMI) dipped to 50.1 April, when speculators had wagered on a steady outcome of 50.5 or even an improvement. A measure of services also disappointed with a pullback to 54.3. The Aussie is often used as a liquid proxy for China plays given Australia is a major exporter of resources to the Asian giant. The currency quickly eased to $0.7040 after the PMI release, from $0.7064. The safe-haven yen got a lift, with the Aussie losing 0.4 percent to 78.59, while holding steady on the U.S. dollar at 111.59 yen. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat at  97.859 and still not far from last week’s near two-year peak of 98.330. The euro was little moved at $0.1180 as investors await figures for economic growth in the common currency bloc due later in the session. Forecasts are for a modest rise of 0.3 percent in the first quarter, although that would still be faster than the previous quarter and may be taken as a sign of stabilization. Even such tentative growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. A major hurdle for the dollar remains the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which ends on Wednesday with a statement and a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. No change in policy is expected but the market is keen to hear how Powell resolves the divergence between solid economic growth and slowing inflation. U.S. data overnight showed consumer spending enjoyed the sharpest rebound in 9-1/2 years in March, yet core inflation still slowed to a 14-month low. The core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, slowed to 1.6 percent and further way from the central bank’s 2 percent target. “A sustained acceleration in core inflation remains elusive and is contributing to low inflation expectations,” said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett. “This is not just an issue for the FOMC, it is a real concern for other major central banks.” “We expect the dovish tone from central banks to continue for the foreseeable future,” she added. “Given evidence of a recovery in growth, this is very positive for risk assets.” Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Kim Coghill and Sam HolmesAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

881,Growth in China's services activity slows in April: official PMI - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  1:18 AM / in 8 days","1 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China’s services industry slowed in April, an official survey showed on Tuesday, adding to uncertainty over demand in the world’s second-largest economy. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 54.3 in April from 54.8 in March, but stayed well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Services account for more than half of China’s economy, and rising wages have increased Chinese consumers’ spending power. But the sector softened late last year along with a slowdown in the broader economy. The official April composite PMI, which covers both manufacturing and services activity, slipped to 53.4 from March’s 54.0.

883,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares dip as investors await China data, Fed - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  12:54 AM / in 8 days","4 Min Read* MSCI Asia ex-Japan -0.1 pct * Japan markets closed as emperor prepares to abdicate * Investors watching China manufacturing data * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Asia fell on Tuesday despite another record high close for the S&P 500, as investors await a U.S. Federal Reserve policy decision for clues of whether it will continue to take a “patient” approach to interest rate policy. Traders were also cautious ahead of readings on China’s factory activity (0100 GMT), hoping for more signs that the world’s second-largest economy is starting to stabilise in response to a flurry of stimulus measures. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was off 0.1 percent, weighed by weakness in Korean shares, which fell 0.4 percent. Australian equities fell 0.3 percent, while New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.3 percent. Japan’s financial markets remain closed for a national holiday as Japanese Emperor Akihito prepares to abdicate on Tuesday in favour of his elder son, Crown Prince Naruhito. Asia’s wobbly open followed cautious gains on Wall Street overnight that nevertheless lifted the S&P 500 index to an intraday record high of 2,949.52. The index finished up 0.11 percent at a record closing high of 2,943.03. The Nasdaq gained 0.19 percent to 8,161.85, also a record closing high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a 0.04 percent gain to 26,554.39. The quiet start to the week in global equity markets comes ahead of a two-day meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is set to release its latest statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. The Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, as it seeks to balance robust economic growth against low inflation. In the latest slew of data sending mixed signals to the Fed, U.S. consumer spending rose at the fastest pace in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the bank’s favoured inflation measure, logged its smallest annual rise in 14 months. “We expect the dovish tone from central banks to continue for the foreseeable future. Given evidence of a recovery in growth, this is very positive for risk assets,” analysts at ANZ said in a morning note. Investors will also be watching manufacturing data in China, which is expected to show a steady but modest expansion in activity for April. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes retreated to 2.527 percent as of 2330 GMT Tuesday after rising to a close of 2.536 percent Tuesday on the strong consumer spending data. The two-year yield, watched as a gauge of expectations of rate rises, was at 2.2942 percent, off from a U.S. close Tuesday of 2.298 percent. Currency markets remained quiet. The dollar was barely changed against the yen at 111.65, and the euro was flat at $1.1185. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was also unchanged, holding at 97.852. Oil prices turned lower, after edging higher on Monday as markets attempted to resume a rally interrupted by demands from U.S. President Donald Trump that OPEC raise output. U.S. crude fell 0.14 percent to $63.41 per barrel and Brent crude was down 0.4 percent at $71.75 per barrel. Gold showed some lustre after dipping Tuesday on the U.S. data. Spot gold was up 0.13 percent at $1,281.19 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Kim CoghillAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

885,FOREX-Dollar awaits China data to gauge global growth pulse - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  12:01 AM / in 8 days","3 Min Read* Major currencies mark time before China factory data * Official PMI seen holding steady at 50.5 in April * EU to report first-quarter GDP later in the day By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 30 (Reuters) - The dollar was all but flatlining in Asia on Tuesday as investors awaited readings on Chinese manufacturing and the European economy to gauge the pulse of the global economy. China’s official purchasing management index (PMI) is forecast to hold at 50.5 in April after bouncing in March in what analysts hoped was evidence that policy stimulus was gaining traction in the economy. A solid report could support risk assets and currencies leveraged to Chinese growth, including the Australian dollar , while pressuring the safe-haven yen. Figures for economic growth in the Eurozone out later in the session are forecast to show a modest rise of 0.3 percent in the first quarter, but at least that would be up from the previous quarter and may be taken as a hint of stabilisation. Even such tentative growth could squeeze speculators who have been amassing large short positions in the euro, worth a net $14.8 billion in the week to April 23. For now, the euro was steady at $1.1184, having edged away from a near two-year trough of $1.1110 hit last week. The dollar was stuck at 111.67 yen, having traded a very tight range with Japan on holiday. Resistance is lined up at the recent top of 112.39, with support at 111.37 and 110.83. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction softer at 97.856, having eased from last week’s near two-year peak of 98.330. The major hurdle for the dollar remains the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which ends on Wednesday with a statement and a news conference by Chairman Jerome Powell. No change in policy is expected but the market is keen to hear how Powell resolves the divergence between solid economic growth and slowing inflation. U.S. data overnight showed consumer spending enjoyed the sharpest rebound in 9-1/2 years in March, yet core inflation still slowed to a 14-month low.

887,WRAPUP 1-China's big banks post modest Q1 profit growth - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:46 PM / in 8 days","4 Min Read* Top five banks post Q1 profit growth of more than 4 percent * Signs of steadying in China economy may ease bad loan risks * But asset quality concerns linger amid push for more lending to private sector By Cheng Leng and Shu Zhang BEIJING/SINGAPORE, April 30(Reuters) - China’s five largest state-owned banks posted modest first-quarter profit growth, though slightly below expectations, as policymakers pushed lenders to make more loans to support the slowing economy. Net profits at the country’s so-called Big Five banks, led by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (ICBC) , grew by more than 4 percent in the January-March quarter from a year earlier. The gain comes on the heels of disappointing 2018 fourth-quarter results that saw four of the five lenders posting their weakest quarterly profit growth in more than two years as business activity slowed and they sharply increased provisions for bad loans. March economic data, however, have suggested the economy may be starting to bottom out, buoyed by a flurry of stimulus measures ranging from higher infrastructure spending to massive corporate tax cuts. Profits at China’s industrial firms also returned to growth in March after shrinking for four months, adding to optimism that strains on corporate balance sheets may be easing in at least some sectors. Chinese banks extended a record amount of new credit in the first quarter, totalling 5.81 trillion yuan ($862.89 billion). ICBC, the world’s top commercial lender by assets, on Monday posted a 4.1 percent profit rise to 82.01 billion yuan, its fastest first-quarter growth since 2014. Bank of Communications (BoCom) , the fifth-largest in China, booked its fastest quarterly growth in five years with a 4.9 percent rise to 21.07 billion yuan. Analysts had expected ICBC and BoCom to report profit growth of 4.3 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. Non-performing loan (NPL) ratios fell at ICBC, BoCom and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd , and held steady at China Construction Bank Ltd (CCB) and Bank of China Ltd (BoC) . The pressure on asset quality of banks has marginally eased due to a stabilizing economy in the first quarter, and disposal of bad loans by lenders, said Nicholas Zhu, a Beijing-based banking analyst of Moody’s Investors Service. However, few analysts are betting on a sustained improvement in asset quality as Beijing pushes state lenders to aggressively ramp up lending to smaller, private companies, which are considered higher credit risks than state-backed firms and more vulnerable to cyclical downturns. Analysts have also cautioned it is too early to say there has been a sustainable turnaround in the economy. “The formation of new NPLs can’t be taken lightly should the macroeconomic situation become less stable, so there’s a lingering concern for the asset quality,” Zhu said. Net interest margin, a key gauge of profitability, improved slightly at ICBC and BoCom but narrowed by 0.08 percentage points at BoC and 0.02 percentage points at CCB in the quarter. Margins at big banks will likely continue to narrow over the course of 2019 due to relatively ample liquidity in the market, said Wang Jian, Shanghai-based banking analyst at Guosen Securities. “Unless the economy picks up significantly, the central bank is not likely to tighten the liquidity condition,” Wang said.

888,White House says Stephen Moore still has Trump's support for Fed seat - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  4:07 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House still backs Stephen Moore for a seat on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser said on Monday, despite concerns among some Democratic lawmakers about his competence and past remarks. “We’re still behind him, and he’s going through the process of vetting,” National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House. Moore, who said on Sunday he was facing a “smear campaign,” has come under fire for comments about women and his out-of-the-mainstream economic views. Democrats also worry he is too political for the independent central bank. Even some Republican senators are lukewarm. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters on Monday that Moore had “a pretty common-sense approach to economics.” “But does that qualify him to be a Fed member?” he asked, adding that he was withholding judgment for now. Republican Senator Richard Shelby told reporters he had not committed to supporting Moore’s possible nomination and was concerned about the “drip by drip” of negative news stories about him. Shelby is a member of the Banking Committee, which would consider a Fed nomination. In 2014, Moore wrote that family stability could be disrupted if women earned more than men, and in 2000 he opined that “women tennis pros don’t really want equal pay for equal work. They want equal pay for inferior work.” He has also called cities in the Midwest the “armpits of America.” Moore has been criticized for voicing support for tying monetary policy decisions to commodity prices and for his fluctuating views on interest rates. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Monday the White House was reviewing Moore’s past comments.   Trump has yet to formally nominate the long-time economic commentator, who would need to be confirmed by the Senate to take the post. There are currently two vacancies on the Fed’s board. Trump wanted to nominate businessman Herman Cain for the second vacancy, but Cain bowed out last week after it became clear he did not have the needed support in the Senate. Kudlow said the administration was interviewing a number of candidates for that second Fed post. Trump has frequently criticized the Fed for pushing borrowing costs up. Kudlow has said both he and the president feel rates should be lowered, a position Moore has also previously advocated. On Monday, Kudlow told Fox Business Network that signs inflation was slowing “opens the door” to a rate cut. The central bank last month brought a three-year rate-hike cycle to an end amid signs of slower global economic growth.

889,Senior prosecutor Weissmann to leave U.S. special counsel's team soon - Reuters,"March 14, 2019 /  3:35 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - One of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s top prosecutors will soon leave his post, a spokesman said on Thursday, confirming a move likely to add fuel to speculation that the investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election is nearing an end. Andrew Weissmann, who orchestrated the prosecution of  President Donald Trump’s campaign chairman Paul Manafort, will leave the special counsel’s team “in the near future,” Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said. News of his departure, first reported by National Public Radio, came a day after Manafort was sentenced by a federal judge in Washington, bringing his total punishment to 7-1/2 years in prison from two criminal cases brought by Mueller’s team. Manafort was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a litany of financial and other crimes. Weissmann, who has taught at the New York University School of Law in the past, is in talks with the school to return to a teaching post “following his current commitments,” said Michael Orey, a university spokesman. Weissmann has been a pivotal member of Mueller’s team, which has brought charges against 34 people and three companies during a 22-month-old investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 campaign conspired with Russia and whether the Republican president unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Unless Weissmann is leaving for unspecified personal reasons, his departure signals Mueller has likely completed all of the inquiry’s major investigative steps, although there could still be additional indictments, said Barbara McQuade, a former senior federal prosecutor in Michigan. “I see this as the surest sign yet of a wrap-up,” McQuade said. A handful of other prosecutors working with the special counsel already have left their posts, while a senior FBI agent on Mueller’s team, David Archey, this month became head of the FBI’s office in Richmond, Virginia. Mueller is preparing to deliver a confidential report on his findings to Attorney General William Barr, marking the conclusion of the special counsel’s work. Barr will then decide how much of the report to make public. The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a non-binding resolution on Thursday calling for Mueller’s report to be released to Congress and the public. The vote was 420-0, with four conservative Republican lawmakers allied with Trump voting “present.” Before joining Mueller’s team in May 2017, Weissmann was best known for two assignments: the investigation of now-defunct energy company Enron and organized crime cases when he was a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. Weissmann was detailed to the special counsel from the U.S. Justice Department, where he had headed the criminal fraud section. He has given notice to the department that he will not be returning, according to a person familiar with the matter. A department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Weissmann, who was in a Washington federal court on Thursday to attend a hearing in the special counsel’s prosecution of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone, did not respond to a request for comment. Stone was indicted in January, accused of lying about his communications with associates about the Wikileaks website that released documents that prosecutors said were stolen by Russia and made public to hurt Trump’s 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Stone has pleaded not guilty. His trial is set for on Nov. 5. Reporting by Nathan Layne; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball, Susan Heavey and Sarah N.

890,Democrat Beto O'Rourke barnstorms Iowa after jumping into presidential race - Reuters,"March 14, 2019 /  9:09 AM / in 2 months","5 Min ReadBURLINGTON, Iowa (Reuters) - Beto O’Rourke made his debut as a Democratic presidential candidate on Thursday, betting his optimistic economic message, liberal immigration policies and fame gained in a failed bid for the U.S. Senate last year will net him the party’s 2020 nomination. The former U.S congressman from El Paso, Texas, who announced his White House run by video on social media, immediately kicked off a three-day campaign swing through Iowa, which hosts the nation’s first nominating contest in less than a year and is critical to his chances. “The challenges have never been greater, or more severe, or more critical or more defining for our future,” he told an enthusiastic crowd at a coffeehouse in Burlington. O’Rourke, 46, joined a jam-packed field of more than a dozen Democratic candidates, including several U.S. senators. It remains to be seen whether he can make up ground for his relatively late entry into the race. Critics say O’Rourke lacks a deep policy background and his unsuccessful run against U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas last November disqualifies him from pursuing an even higher office.  Still, his underdog race against Cruz earned him a national following. Even in defeat, O’Rourke demonstrated a talent for attracting capacity crowds and raising large sums of money, skills he will need to carry to the national stage if he is to capture the nomination. O’Rourke jumped atop the coffee shop’s counter and delivered an impassioned address, touching upon issues of economic inequality, climate change and education. He largely avoided criticizing President Donald Trump by name but made his opposition to Trump’s policies clear.  He also avoided any allusions to the Democratic field - or his own chances in the race. Asked by an attendee what made him stand out from the pack, he demurred. “All I can tell you is who I am,” he said. He cited his ability to work with Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration. Trump, who became known for slapping derisive nicknames onto opponents during the 2016 campaign, focused on O’Rourke’s hands on Thursday when asked about O’Rourke’s campaign announcement. “Well, I think he’s got a lot of hand movement. I’ve never seen so much hand movement. I said, ‘Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?’,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance with Ireland’s prime minister. Unlike many of his opponents who launched campaigns while barely registering in public opinion polls, O’Rourke begins in sixth place in the RealClearPolitics average of polls, receiving an average of 5 percent. But O’Rourke is far from a front-runner, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering a White House bid, leading polls. It remains to be seen how O’Rourke, a white male with a history of supporting some moderate positions in Congress, will fare in a Democratic nominating battle with a heavy emphasis on progressive policies and diversity. He lands squarely in the middle of an internal party debate about whether to nominate a liberal firebrand or a centrist, and he will face a test on whether he can match up with policy heavyweights like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.  Tom Courtney, a former Iowa state senator and the local chairman of the Democratic Party, said O’Rourke could reshape the race.  “Him coming into the race could dry up money for some of the others,” said Courtney, who is neutral in the party primary. “Some of the candidates who didn’t have too good a chance just might drop out.” Shea McCuen, 36, of Burlington, expressed concern that O’Rourke was too unestablished and progressive and risked alienating traditional Democrats. He said he might make a better vice presidential nominee alongside someone such as Biden.  “Going too young or too new, you’re going to lose some of the older Democrats,” McCuen said. Dawn Hecox, 65, of Fort Madison, Iowa, said O’Rourke reminded her of a young Barack Obama when he ran in Iowa as a presidential candidate in 2007.  “He has really fresh ideas,” Hecox said. “This election I am looking at who can beat Trump,” she added. “We don’t need what we’ve got in Washington right now.”  O’Rourke is the 15th Democrat in the field and the second from Texas, and his opponents took notice. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California sent an email fundraising appeal to her supporters on Thursday that had his name in the subject line. “He injects a lot of excitement, but I also think he has a huge bar to meet,” said Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, who worked on presidential campaigns for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. “The expectations for him are so high that it’s going to be tough not to disappoint some people who are now seeing him through rose-colored glasses.” Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson and Doina Chiacu in Washington and Rich McKay in Atlanta; editing by Colleen Jenkins, Jonathan Oatis and James DalgleishAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

891,Families can sue gun maker for Sandy Hook school massacre: court - Reuters,"March 14, 2019 /  4:02 PM / 2 months ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Families of schoolchildren gunned down in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre can sue Remington Outdoor Co Inc, a Connecticut court ruled on Thursday, in a setback for gun makers long shielded from liability in mass shootings.      In a 4-3 ruling widely expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Connecticut’s highest court found the lawsuit could proceed based on a state law protecting consumers against fraudulent marketing. “The Connecticut Supreme Court has blown a very large hole into the federal immunity for firearms manufacturers in lawsuits alleging criminal misuse of the products they sell,” said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University and author of a book on gun litigation. Remington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a mass shooting that rocked the United States shortly before Christmas of 2012, a 20-year-old gunman killed 20 school children aged 6 and 7 in addition to six adult staff, using a Remington AR-15 Bushmaster rifle, a semi-automatic civilian version of the U.S. military’s M-16. The families of nine of the victims and one survivor have said Remington, along with a gun wholesaler and local retailer, are partially responsible for the carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, because they marketed the weapon based on its militaristic appeal. Josh Koskoff, one of the lawyers for the victims’ families, said in a statement the families were grateful for the court’s rejection of the gun industry’s bid for complete immunity. “The families’ goal has always been to shed light on Remington’s calculated and profit-driven strategy to expand the AR-15 market and court high-risk users, all at the expense of Americans’ safety. Today’s decision is a critical step toward achieving that goal,” Koskoff said. Leading gun control advocates such as Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign applauded the ruling. The National Rifle Association, the powerful gun rights lobby, did not immediately comment. Should the case go before the U.S. Supreme Court, where  conservatives hold a 5-4 majority, it may not be affected by the constitutional protection for people to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Instead, it would depend on the justices’ interpretation of the broader legal question of whether federal courts should generally be allowed to interfere in state law, experts said. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, has provided the U.S. firearms industry an almost impenetrable defense against lawsuits by victims of mass shootings and gun violence, broadly shielding Remington and others such as American Outdoor Brands Corp, Sturm Ruger & Co and Vista Outdoor Inc from liability. The families had tried to advance the case on a relatively novel argument in gun litigation based on the legal doctrine of negligent entrustment, an argument historically used when someone lends a car to a high-risk driver who then causes an accident. The Connecticut court rejected that theory, instead saying the families could bring their claims under the consumer protection statute.  “Once we accept the premise that Congress did not intend to immunize firearms suppliers who engage in truly unethical and irresponsible marketing practices promoting criminal conduct ... it falls to a jury to decide whether the promotional schemes alleged in the present case rise to the level of illegal trade practices and whether fault for the tragedy can be laid at their feet,” the judges said. Three dissenting judges argued that the federal gun maker shield law did not include such an exception.   The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry’s trade association, agreed with the dissenters, saying the ruling was “at odds with all other state and federal appellate courts that have interpreted the scope of the exception.”  Michael Moreland, a professor at Villanova Law School in Pennsylvania, said he expected gun victims to face a difficult legal battle given the broad federal protection for gun manufacturers. The U.S. Supreme Court has trended toward rejecting state law claims that are barred by federal law, he said.

892,UPDATE 1-Brazil's public investment could evaporate to less than 0.5 pct of GDP - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  10:31 PM / in 8 days","3 Min Read(Recasts; adds context, detail, quote) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, April 29 (Reuters) - Brazil’s public investment is grinding to a virtual standstill and could fall to a new record low below 0.5 percent of gross domestic product this year if the government is forced to tighten the squeeze on discretionary spending, the Treasury said on Monday. The forecast accompanied figures that showed the central government’s primary deficit narrowed in March and over the first quarter, but which once again highlighted the precarious state of the country’s public finances. Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida said the improvement so far this year was “temporary,” and warned that an uncertain revenue outlook coupled with onerous non-discretionary spending commitments such as social security could hit federal investment in 2019. “We’re getting to a very critical level,” Almeida told reporters, noting that when discretionary spending is cut, the area that is often sacrificed the most is public investment. Public investment in Brazil has been on a downward path for years, battered by the 2015-16 recession, from which the economy has still not fully recovered. This has forced governments to try and shore up the public finances by slashing spending, most notably via pension reform. Since 2014, public investment has fallen 60 percent, Almeida said, a startling statistic for a country that invests little to begin with. It was 1.7 percent of GDP in 2014, and 0.7 percent of GDP last year. Almeida noted that government revenues could suffer from the steep fall in the price of oil late last year, although crude has recovered some 40 percent this year. But Brazil’s economy is also struggling - some economists reckon it may even have shrunk in the first quarter - which will hit the tax take. “The problem this year is not spending, but revenue,” Almeida told reporters. Under the government’s fiscal rules, if it looks like revenues are going to undershoot forecasts the government will suspend or cut discretionary spending, often public investment. In its first bi-monthly review of spending and revenue last month, the government said almost 30 billion reais ($7.6 billion) needed to be cut from ministries’ budgets this year.

894,Uber drivers plan protest over pay ahead of IPO - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  9:51 PM / 8 days ago","2 Min ReadApril 29 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in six U.S. cities are planning to shut their apps for 12 hours on May 8 to protest against low wages and working conditions, two days ahead of the company’s expected market debut. Drivers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington DC will shut their app on the day, when a separate protest will be carried out outside Uber’s head office in San Francisco, a spokeswoman for Gig Workers Rising, a campaign for gig workers, told Reuters. About “hundreds of drivers” are likely to join the protest, with Los Angeles and San Francisco expected to see a higher concentration of people, Clarkson said on Monday. The drivers’ demands also include employee benefit plans such as health care, holiday pay and representation in Uber’s management structure. Uber expects to price its IPO on May 9 and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day,  people familiar with the matter have said. “Uber’s IPO will put millions in the pockets of executives, but the drivers who provide the service that is core to the company will get nothing, “ Clarkson said. To improve relations with drivers, Uber had announced plans to offer cash bonuses to some of its most active drivers with the option to purchase shares in the company’s market debut.

895,Democrats insist on 'substantial' new revenue for U.S. infrastructure - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  4:11 PM / 8 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A day before heading to the White House to meet with President Donald Trump, top Democrats in Congress on Monday said a bill to boost U.S. infrastructure must be funded with “substantial, new and real revenue” to meet massive needs across the country. In a letter to the president released ahead of their meeting on Tuesday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer outlined their priorities for draft legislation, which they said included renewable energy, broadband, water, school, and housing infrastructure. They also called for investments in risk mitigation efforts for current infrastructure to handle the effects of climate change. “We look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country’s needs,” they wrote. Both Republicans and Democrats have supported taking measures to strengthen U.S. infrastructure, but the price tag and measures to pay for it may be a stumbling block to cooperation. Trump economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters on Monday that the president had not made up his mind on whether to support raising a federal tax on gasoline to help fund an infrastructure package. Both sides are keeping expectations low for the meeting and no formal proposals are expected to be exchanged.  “We want to hear what they have to say about it, and we’ll react to that. But no, we’re not ... coming into it with a blueprint,” Kudlow said. In a February 2018 meeting with lawmakers, Trump had endorsed hiking the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents per gallon to fund infrastructure improvements, Democratic Senator Tom Carper said. The current tax of 18.4 cents a gallon on gasoline has been in place since 1993. The federal diesel tax is 24.4 cents a gallon. Schumer said on Monday that the federal government could finance $1 trillion in infrastructure improvements by reversing some of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and modestly boosting corporate tax rates. The tax bill is one of Trump’s signature legislative accomplishments. “It would be extraordinarily unfair to ask the middle class to shoulder the cost of an infrastructure bill,” Schumer said.  The president, who vowed in 2016 to back $1 trillion of infrastructure spending over 10 years, has been vague about his plans in recent months. In February last year, Trump asked Congress to authorize $200 billion in federal money over 10 years to spur road, bridge and other projects mostly funded by states, cities and the private sector. That plan was roundly criticized and never voted on in Congress, which was then controlled by Republicans. An administration official confirmed that Trump was not a fan of that plan, which featured public-private partnerships, which he said Trump did not believe would work at the federal level. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on April 11 that a big infrastructure boost is popular but “nobody on either side has stepped up with a credible proposal to pay for it. “I’m all for taking it up once the president and Democrats, everybody says OK, here’s how we’re going to pay for it. As soon as that magically appears I think we have a way forward,” McConnell said. Pelosi requested the meeting on infrastructure with Trump. Other Democrats expected to attend include Representatives Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Richard Neal, who chairs the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Senators Dick Durbin, Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, Ron Wyden and Carper will also attend, along with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, No. 3 House Democrat James Clyburn and Representative Ben Ray Lujan.

897,"S&P 500 posts high, extends 2019 rally; Alphabet falls late - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  12:06 PM / in 8 days","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 set an intraday record high on Monday, bolstering the view that the decade-long bull market has further to run, after consumer spending rose in March and inflation data was benign. The benchmark index topped its intraday record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21, rising to a session high of 2,949.52. The S&P 500 is now up more than 17% for the year to date. The index along with the Nasdaq posted another record close as well on Monday.  Hopes of a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve have powered the rally in stocks this year, and even though the Monday’s gains were small, strategists said recent new highs encourage further buying.  “It does create pressure to bring more buyers. Today’s headline augments the fear of missing out. It’s going to make the bears less bearish or more worried they’re going to get run over,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. A Commerce Department report showed U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but a key inflation measure posted its smallest annual gain in 14 months. Tame inflation supports the Fed’s recent decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted tariff spat between the two countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a television interview that aired on Monday, said he hopes that the latest talks between the United States and China may seal a trade deal. “It’s really about the administration continuing to hint a trade agreement is near,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “People don’t want to miss out on the expected rally from that news.”          The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.06 points, or 0.04%, to 26,554.39, the S&P 500 gained 3.15 points, or 0.11%, to 2,943.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.46 points, or 0.19%, to 8,161.85. The Fed starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced. Another busy week of earnings is expected. After the bell, shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc were down 7.2% after it reported revenue below Wall Street targets.  Alphabet shares ended the regular session up 1.5% at $1,296.20.  Apple Inc is due to report on Tuesday. Analysts now expect earnings of S&P 500 companies to have fallen just 0.2% in the first quarter, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data.  Ingersoll-Rand shares jumped 6.5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Gardner Denver Holdings Inc is nearing a deal to acquire a unit of the air conditioner maker. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 25 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.81 billion shares, compared to the 6.56 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (This story has been refiled to to say Alphabet, not Google, in headline).

901,WeWork owner The We Company joins IPO stampede - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:16 PM / in 8 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - WeWork owner The We Company said on Monday it had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with U.S. regulators, the latest in a swarm of U.S. startups planning a stock market debut this year. WeWork, recently valued at $47 billion in a private fundraising round, said its amended IPO registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will help it decide if it is sure it wants to become a publicly traded company. “After a lot of thought, last week we decided to file the first amendment to our submission, which is a step towards allowing us to decide to become a public company,” Chief Executive Adam Neumann wrote to staff in a memo seen by Reuters.  “I do not have an exact date or timeline to share with you, but I wanted you to know first that this process has started.” If it completes its IPO in 2019, WeWork is likely to be the biggest company by value to list on the stock market this year after Uber Technologies Inc, which is aiming for a valuation of up to $91 billion when it prices its IPO next week.  WeWork has helped pioneer “coworking,” or shared desk-space, with a focus on startups, entrepreneurs and freelancers, and has received significant backing from some of the world’s biggest investors, including Japan’s SoftBank.  The company has faced questions about the sustainability of its business model, which is based on short-term revenue agreements and long-term loan liabilities.  In the first three quarters of 2018, WeWork posted a net loss of about $1.22 billion on revenue of $1.25 billion.  The New York-based company, founded in 2010, said in January it would operate under a new name, The We Company, which would operate separate business units that lease commercial office space, rent out residences and run schools. Earlier this year, SoftBank boosted its stake in WeWork by $2 billion in a deal that was billions of dollars below what the shared workspace provider had hoped to raise to fund growth and buy out existing shareholders. Investors expect 2019 to be one of the most active years on record for high-profile new listings, with the likes of Slack Technologies and Postmates also planning to go public, as the stock market hovers near all-time highs. So far in 2019, technology or internet companies have raised $7 billion through IPOs in the United States, compared to $20.8 billion for the whole of last year, according to data provider Dealogic.

902,U.S. lawmakers say Boeing 737 MAX 8 grounded for at least 'weeks' - Reuters,"March 14, 2019 /  4:09 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said after a briefing with the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday that Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 9 planes will remain grounded for “weeks” at a minimum, until a software upgrade could be tested and installed in all of the planes. FAA Administrator Dan Elwell told reporters on Wednesday the software update will be ready within a couple of months after regulators around the world grounded the plane following a second fatal crash in the 737 MAX 8 since October. The FAA said Monday it planned to require the upgrade it termed “design changes” by April. An FAA spokesman confirmed Thursday that the FAA will not unground the airplanes until the software patch is approved and installed. The software patch may not be enough to allow the planes to be ungrounded depending on the findings from the ongoing investigation into the crash of Ethiopian Airlines 302 that killed 157 people on Sunday. Boeing declined to comment, but said Monday it would roll out the software improvement “across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks.” Representative Rick Larsen said after the briefing the software upgrade would take a few weeks to complete and installing on all aircraft would take “at least through April.” He said additional training would also have to take place. Larsen, the top Democrat on an aviation subcommittee, said despite the fact that the FAA was the last major regulator to ground the plane, the “rest of the world is looking to the FAA to lead the effort on the fix and to make a decision about ungrounding the airplanes.” Representative Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the software upgrade will result in the airplanes behaving more like older versions of the 737. The upgrade will revise an automated protection system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS, which come under scrutiny in October’s fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia. “After the pilot has tried to correct, the MCAS is going to not keep repeating itself, which is what it does now. It keep triggering automatically and the pilot has to do it again,” DeFazio said, unless it is manually disengaged by the pilot. “It will essentially shut itself off.” The upgrade will address if there is a disagreement between censors, DeFazio said.  Lawmakers noted that there have been no confirmed incidents in 50,000 North America flights with the 737 MAX 8 and questioned if training by carriers abroad was an issue.

903,Trump slams handling of Brexit by UK's May - Reuters,"March 14, 2019 /  3:15 PM / in 2 months","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday criticized British Prime Minister Theresa May’s handling of the Brexit talks for Britain’s departure from the European Union and said another referendum on the issue would be unfair to the side that won. Trump, who met May last summer at Blenheim Palace, England, said he had given her his ideas on how to handle the negotiation on Britain’s break from the European Union but that she had not taken his advice. “I will tell you, I’m surprised at how badly it’s all gone from the standpoint of a negotiation,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. “But I gave the prime minister my ideas on how to negotiate it and I think you would have been successful. She didn’t listen to that, and that’s fine. I mean ... she’s got to do what she’s got to do. But I think it could have been negotiated in a different manner, frankly.” Trump said he planned to stay out of the negotiations. He also said another vote on Brexit would be unfair, and reiterated that he would like to see a U.S. trade deal with the United Kingdom after it leaves the EU. “I hate to see it being, everything being ripped apart right now. I don’t think another vote would be possible because it would be very unfair to the people that won,” Trump said.     Varadkar, sitting alongside Trump at the White House, said he looked forward to discussing Brexit with Trump and that he would like to see a European trade deal with the United States.

905,Trump's ex-lawyer Cohen says testimony 'could have been clearer': lawyer - Reuters,"March 13, 2019 /  1:53 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen’s testimony to Congress regarding any potential pardon for his crimes “could have been clearer,” but he never personally asked the president for such a reprieve, Cohen’s lawyer said. In a statement to lawmakers on Tuesday, Cohen’s legal team sought to clarify his recent testimony amid questions over whether Cohen sought, or Trump offered, a pardon to the man who once declared he would take a bullet for the Republican president but later flipped to cooperate with federal prosecutors.  Cohen, who is to report to prison in May for campaign finance crimes and previously lying to Congress, said at a public hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives panel last month, “I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.” Trump himself challenged that claim. In a tweet on Friday, Trump said that Cohen “directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again!” Cohen, in his own tweet, responded, calling the president’s assertion “another set of lies.” On Wednesday, two Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which publicly questioned Cohen about possible pardons, asked Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democratic committee chairman, to join them in referring Cohen to the Justice Department for a possible perjury investigation.  Cummings said he did not “see the need for further action - at least at this time.”  “Our practice on this Committee is to give witnesses an opportunity to clarify their testimony, and that is what Mr. Cohen has done,” Cummings said in a statement.  In Tuesday’s letter, an attorney for Cohen said his testimony about not seeking a pardon referred to the period after Cohen decided to break from Trump in June 2018 and left their joint defense agreement.      “Cohen rejected the opportunity to ask for and receive a pardon even though he knew he was going to prison with hardships to his family,” Cohen lawyer Michael Monico said in the letter to the Oversight Committee. Another attorney, Robert Costello, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that Cohen instructed him last year to ask Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani about the possibility of a pardon. “We have documents to back our position up, and are preparing to provide these to the U.S. Attorney’s office, who has asked for them,” Costello said in a statement to Reuters. Giuliani told Reuters last week that Costello called him around May 2018 and said, “Cohen has asked me to raise with you, can he get a pardon?” “I told him, no, you’re not going to get a pardon,” Giuliani said, adding that at one point Costello told him “Cohen was upset, but he never asked again about a pardon.” Lanny Davis, another Cohen lawyer, said later on Wednesday that “Mr. Cohen’s testimony was truthful. The letter provided greater time frame context for that testimony.”  Davis complained that Oversight Committee Republicans had never “mentioned the hush money checks signed by President Trump, proving that the president committed a felony as part of the Stormy Daniels illegal hush money scheme” and questioned why Representative Jim Jordan, one of Trump’s most avid defenders on the committee, had ignored this. Cohen has met with congressional committees four times since being sentenced, including a televised Feb. 27 hearing led by Cummings.

906,"Senate rebukes Trump on Saudi, backs war powers resolution - Reuters","March 13, 2019 /  2:19 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved a resolution seeking to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the war in Yemen, in a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s policy toward the kingdom. The vote was 54-46 in the Senate, more than the 51 needed to pass in the 100-member Senate, as seven Republicans joined Democrats in backing the measure. The war powers resolution seeks to end any U.S. military involvement in the conflict, including providing targeting support for Saudi air strikes, without authorization from Congress. The four-year-long civil war in Yemen, which pits the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels backed by Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire humanitarian crisis, with the country on the brink of famine. Backers of the resolution, including a handful of Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, argued that U.S. involvement in Yemen violates the constitutional requirement that Congress, not the president, should determine when the country goes to war. “We’re helping a foreign power bomb its adversaries in what is undoubtedly, irrefutably, a war,” said Republican Senator Mike Lee, who sponsored the resolution, urging a ‘yes’ vote. The Yemen vote could be only the first of two major setbacks for Trump this week, as senators are due to vote tomorrow on a resolution disapproving of his use of his emergency powers to pay for a wall on the border with Mexico, even though Congress has not approved it. The resolution must still be approved by the House of Representatives to be sent to the White House, which said earlier on Wednesday that Trump plans a veto. It would be the first of his two-year-long presidency. MESSAGE TO TRUMP - AND RIYADH Democrats and Republicans reintroduced the resolution two weeks ago as a way to send a strong message to Riyadh - and to Trump - about the humanitarian disaster in Yemen. Many lawmakers also want to push Trump to demand a stronger response from the Saudi government to the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey in October. Trump has held back on criticizing Saudi Arabia, calling them an important strategic ally and counterbalance to Iran in the region. He has also touted Saudi purchases of U.S. defense equipment as a generator of American jobs. Resolution opponents argued that support for the Saudi-led coalition is not an appropriate use of the war powers act limiting the president’s ability to send troops into action, because U.S. forces are not actively engaged in fighting. Some also contended that stopping U.S. support would help Iran, and potentially prolong the conflict by ending Washington’s ability to influence Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a partner in the conflict, to pursue a sustainable political settlement. “We need to stay engaged with the limited engagement that we have,” said Senator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He also said the resolution “sets a bad precedent” because the United States is not directly involved in Yemen. The Senate had approved the war powers resolution in December, during the last Congress, the first time such a measure had passed the chamber. But Republicans, who controlled the House until January, did not let it come up for a vote. With the Democrats in control, the House passed its own version of the resolution in February, but a procedural issue meant the House must vote on the Senate’s version of the measure. Overcoming a veto would require two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and House, more votes than it has garnered so far.

907,Senate Republican delivers blow to Trump border emergency - Reuters,"March 13, 2019 /  2:10 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate appeared poised to pass a proposal to terminate President Donald Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the southern border, despite his threat to veto the measure and heavy lobbying of his fellow Republicans.  Republican Senator Mike Lee, who had been shopping a second bill that would keep the emergency declaration in effect temporarily, said on Wednesday the White House had said Trump would not support his proposal, so he would be voting on Thursday to end the emergency declaration. “For decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch,” Lee said in a statement. “I will be voting to terminate the latest emergency declaration.” The Utah lawmaker was the fifth Republican senator to say they back a measure passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives to terminate Trump’s declaration. In the 100-seat Senate, votes from at least four Republicans are needed to pass the measure, along with all 45 Democrats and two independents. Given Trump’s threat to veto the legislation, it is unlikely to become law. “We’ll see whether or not I have to do the veto. And it will be, I think, all very successful, regardless of how it all works out, but it’s going to be very successful,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday. At stake are billions of dollars in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump is demanding but Congress has refused to fully provide. The stalemate led to a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January. Under the emergency declaration Trump signed on Feb. 15, he would take money from other federal programs to build the barrier he says is needed to curb illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs. There are also court challenges asserting Congress, not the president, decides how taxpayer money is spent. Republicans who oppose the national emergency are worried that future Democratic presidents could usurp the power of Congress to fund the government and use the tactic to pass their own pet programs. Lee had introduced a second measure that would end future emergency declarations after 30 days unless Congress votes to extend them. That 30-day approval window would apply after Trump’s current border declaration expires in one year, meaning it could remain in place for at least a year without congressional approval. Vice President Mike Pence met with Republican senators this week to push Lee’s plan, saying Trump would support it. Lee said on Wednesday the White House had subsequently made clear his bill did “not have an immediate path forward” and he hoped it could be the “starting point for future work.” Reporting by Amanda Becker, Richard Cowan, Doina Chiacu and Tim Ahmann; Additional reporting by Steve Holland, David Shepardson and Makini Brice; Editing by David Gregorio and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

908,Trump announces news conference at U.S.-Mexico border within three weeks - Reuters,"March 13, 2019 /  6:49 PM / in 2 months","1 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his administration would have a news conference at the southern U.S. border with Mexico in the next three weeks, as he continues to seek congressional backing for a wall there. “We’re going to have a news conference at the border over the next three weeks,” Trump told reporters at a briefing at the White House on drug trafficking.     The U.S. Congress is on the verge of issuing a sharp rebuke to Trump over his declaration of an emergency at the border. Already approved by the House of Representatives, the resolution to terminate the declaration has sufficient support in the Senate to be passed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week. Trump said “we’ll see” whether he has to veto the congressional resolution ending his emergency declaration.

910,U.S. drops reference to 'Israeli-occupied' Golan Heights in annual rights report - Reuters,"March 13, 2019 /  3:49 PM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadJERUSALEM (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department changed its usual description of the Golan Heights from “Israeli-occupied” to “Israeli-controlled” in an annual global human rights report released on Wednesday. The move came amid intensified efforts by Israel to win  U.S. recognition of its claim to sovereignty over the strategic plateau it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and effectively annexed in 1981, a step not recognized internationally. There was no immediate comment from Israeli leaders on the U.S. terminology change, which stopped short of a formal  declaration accepting the territorial claim. The Golan - like the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories also taken by Israel in the June 1967 conflict - is regarded internationally as occupied under a U.N. Security Council resolution passed later that year. On Monday, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham toured the Golan with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pledged to lobby the Trump administration to recognize the area as belonging to Israel. A separate section in the State Department report, on the West Bank and Gaza, did not include the terms “occupied” or under “occupation” in referring to the Palestinian territories. But a State Department official, commenting on the absence of those words, said: “The policy on the status of the territories has not changed” and the report was focused on human rights issues, not legal terminology. Palestinians have been concerned about the strength of a long-standing U.S. commitment to the creation of a state of their own in the West Bank and Gaza, a pledge stemming from interim peace deals with Israel signed in the 1990s. Breaking with a decades-long policy, and drawing Palestinian accusations of pro-Israel bias, President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017. He moved the U.S. Embassy to the contested holy city from Tel Aviv last year. Commenting on the State Department report, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said new “U.S. labels” for Palestinian lands “will not change the fact that this is occupied territory, in accordance with U.N. resolutions and international law”. U.S. officials have said Washington will present a new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan after Israel’s April 9 election. Netanyahu travels to Washington later this month to address the pro-Israeli lobby AIPAC, and Israeli media reports said he also plans to hold talks with Trump, with the Golan recognition issue on the agenda. Formal U.S. acceptance of Israel’s territorial claim could bolster Netanyahu’s re-election prospects in a closely contested race as he battles corruption allegations, which he denies. Hours before the U.S. report was released, Israel accused a suspected Lebanese Hezbollah operative who was previously held in Iraq over the killing of five U.S. military personnel of now setting up a guerrilla network on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan for cross-border attacks.

911,"US STOCKS-S&P 500 posts record high, extending 2019 rally - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  8:46 PM / 8 days ago","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * S&P 500 hits new intraday high, crosses 2,940.91 * Consumer spending rose in March * Indexes up: Dow 0.04%, S&P 500 0.1%, Nasdaq 0.2% (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 set an intraday record high on Monday, bolstering the view that the decade-long bull market has further to run, after consumer spending rose in March and inflation data was benign. The benchmark index topped its intraday record of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21, rising to a session high of 2,949.52. The S&P 500 is now up more than 17% for the year to date. The index along with the Nasdaq posted another record close as well on Monday. Hopes of a resolution of the U.S.-China trade war, upbeat earnings and a dovish Federal Reserve have powered the rally in stocks this year, and even though the Monday’s gains were small, strategists said recent new highs encourage further buying. “It does create pressure to bring more buyers. Today’s headline augments the fear of missing out. It’s going to make the bears less bearish or more worried they’re going to get run over,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. A Commerce Department report showed U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but a key inflation measure posted its smallest annual gain in 14 months. Tame inflation supports the Fed’s recent decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted tariff spat between the two countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a television interview that aired on Monday, said he hopes that the latest talks between the United States and China may seal a trade deal. “It’s really about the administration continuing to hint a trade agreement is near,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “People don’t want to miss out on the expected rally from that news.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.06 points, or 0.04%, to 26,554.39, the S&P 500 gained 3.15 points, or 0.11%, to 2,943.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.46 points, or 0.19%, to 8,161.85. The Fed starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced. Another busy week of earnings is expected, with results due from Google parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc among other top names. Analysts now expect earnings of S&P 500 companies to have fallen just 0.2% in the first quarter, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv data. Ingersoll-Rand shares jumped 6.5 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported Gardner Denver Holdings Inc is nearing a deal to acquire a unit of the air conditioner maker. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 25 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 5.81 billion shares, compared to the 6.56 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

913,Uber quizzed on growth at IPO roadshow in London - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  2:35 PM / in 8 days","5 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi sought to persuade money managers in London that the loss-making ride hailing firm’s growth plans justified a valuation of up to $91.5 billion in an initial public offering (IPO). In the ballroom at Claridge’s, the five-star hotel in London’s wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened on Monday to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company’s plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping.  Uber is trying to show investors that it can shift from being simply a ride-hailing service to a technology platform for services ranging from delivering groceries and take-away meals to organizing freight transportation.  “While they didn’t call themselves Amazon, they made several references to their platform and how they intend to build that out,” said one investor who attended the hour-long presentation but declined to be named.   Uber reported on Friday it was aiming for a valuation of between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion, less than the $120 billion investment bankers told the company last year it could fetch. It also disclosed it suffered a loss of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion in the first quarter of 2019. Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit and some investors at the roadshow said the ride-hailing industry faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability.  “It’s going to be much more difficult and cumbersome to extract profitability,” said another investor who attended the roadshow.     Uber’s lower valuation target follows the poor performance of smaller rival Lyft Inc, whose shares are down around 20 percent from when the company listed last month. Lyft was the first U.S. ride-hailing company to go public and one challenge investors grappled with was how to value a company with no clear peer.  The second investor who attended the Uber roadshow said people should look at the airline industry, as opposed to other technology companies, when assessing Uber’s business model.  “If you think about airlines, there’s a lot of barriers to entry and there are capital intensive barriers, but ultimately airlines are not massively profitable,” the investor said.  A spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the investor comments.  After widespread media coverage of Lyft’s IPO marketing, Uber appears to be aiming for a more discreet roadshow.  Investors were not told the presentation’s venue until around three hours before it began, and attendees all had to show government-issued identification before being granted admission with media firmly barred.  One investor, who declined to be named like the others, complained that the event was relatively brief, saying they did not have a chance to ask many questions.  A source working on the roadshow said the presentation - the only one for investors outside of the U.S. - lasted only around 10 minutes, with another 50 spent on questions and answers. As well as growth and cost-control, several questions focused on the company’s culture and business practices following a string of embarrassing scandals have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. In London, the transport authority refused to renew Uber’s license in September 2017 citing safety concerns, though it was granted a 15-month probationary operating license last June, telling a court it had improved its procedures.  “The CEO was very impressive and their governance is much better now, they’ve done so much in a short space of time,” said the first investor. Khosrowshahi took the role in Aug. 2017, succeeding co-founder Travis Kalanick. The Uber IPO, which is expected to price on May 9 according to people familiar with the matter, would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014. The Uber IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs & Co and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

914,"Global stocks climb as S&P 500 hits record, oil steadies after selloff - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  1:08 AM / 8 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - A jump in U.S. consumer spending propelled U.S. shares to a record high on Monday and global equities edged upwards, helping offset a weak euro zone sentiment survey and political uncertainty over Spain’s elections. Major U.S. indexes advanced modestly, with the S&P 500 topping its intraday record of 2,940.91 set on Sept. 21 with a session high of 2,949.52. The benchmark index posted a record closing high last week but had been unable to pierce the intraday mark. Both the S&P and Nasdaq closed at record levels again on Monday.  Economic data showed U.S. consumer spending surged 0.9% in March, the most in more than 9-1/2 years, although inflation  remained subdued, supporting the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to hold off on further U.S. interest rate hikes this year. Sentiment for stocks on Wall Street was also buoyed by the brightening picture of corporate profits, putting some concerns about a possible earnings recession at bay. Refinitiv data showed a 0.2% decline in earnings reports to date for the quarter, a solid improvement from the 2% decline expected at the start of the month. “It does create pressure to bring more buyers. Today’s headline augments the fear of missing out,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.  “It’s going to make the bears less bearish or more worried they’re going to get run over.” The Fed is due to meet this week and will issue its latest policy announcement on Wednesday.

European shares ended a choppy session slightly higher, as investors chose to focus on the positives of a weekend win for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s ruling socialists in Spain’s third election in four years. Spain’s IBEX 35 index managed to rally after falling nearly 1% to end the session 0.12% higher, and Spanish government bond yields dipped after Sanchez overcame a challenge from right-wing nationalists in elections on Sunday.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.08% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.16%. U.S. Treasury yields rose in the wake of the consumer spending data, while the dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies as traders awaited more data to convince them whether to add to their bullish positions in the greenback. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.527%, from 2.504% late on Friday. The dollar index fell 0.17%, with the euro up 0.31% to $1.1183. Oil prices pared early losses of more than $1 a barrel, after dropping nearly 3% on Friday when the market tumbled after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that producer group OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran.  U.S. crude settled up 0.32% at $63.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $72.04, down 0.15% on the day.

916,U.S. Treasury cuts borrowing estimate for second quarter - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:58 PM / in 8 days","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday said it plans to borrow much less in the second quarter than it previously expected as the Federal Reserve ends a plan to reduce its own holdings of U.S. debt securities. In a statement, Treasury said it will borrow $30 billion during the April-June period, less than half its previous estimate of $83 billion.  It said the drop was due to changes in “fiscal activity” and new assumptions of the cash it will need to keep on hand. A Treasury official who asked not to be identified said the fiscal change related to the Fed’s plans to stabilize its massive portfolio of bonds relative to the size of the U.S. economy.  Changes to the Fed’s balance sheet policy have had big impacts on the Treasury’s borrowing needs since the central bank ramped up purchases of Treasury securities around the 2007-09 recession in a bid to support the economy.  For years, the Fed’s added purchases of U.S. debt securities eased the Treasury’s need to borrow from the public. Then, in 2017, the Fed began trimming its balance sheet, which led the Treasury to increase its public borrowing.  In March, the Fed said it would soon begin ending a program to trim its holdings of U.S. securities. That effectively will make the U.S. central bank a bigger buyer of U.S. Treasury securities relative to recent months. Treasury said it expects to borrow $160 billion during the July-September quarter. It borrowed $374 billion through credit markets in the January-March quarter, ending the period with $334 billion in cash. It expects to end the April-June quarter with $270 billion in cash. Additional details of Treasury’s quarterly refunding will be announced at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Wednesday.

918,"Dollar index slips below 23-month high before Fed, U.S. jobs data - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  12:57 AM / in 8 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Monday, slipping further from a 23-month high, as traders await more data to convince them whether to add to their bullish positions in the greenback. Most major currencies held in tight ranges on light trading volume as Japan began its extended Golden Week holiday. China will observe its Labor Day holiday from Wednesday to Friday. A Federal Reserve policy meeting, Brexit negotiations and a raft of global data including U.S. payrolls could each be the trigger for big currency swings this week. “You have a lot of economic data later this week from around the world. People are waiting to see if there is a lot of major shifts,” said Chuck Tomes, associate portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. A swathe of manufacturing surveys from Europe and China are due later this week, along with a first reading on EU GDP. The U.S. payrolls report on Friday is forecast to show a solid increase of 185,000 jobs in April, with unemployment at 3.8%. In late U.S. trading, an index that tracks the greenback against the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was down 0.14% at 97.865. Last week, it reached 98.330, the highest since May 2017. The euro was 0.33% higher at $1.1185, while the dollar was up 0.19% at 111.72 yen. “I expect major currencies to be rangebound in this environment,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. The dollar index failed to move higher after data that showed U.S. consumer spending gaining 0.9% in March, marking its biggest monthly increase in more than 9-1/2 years. The core personal consumption expenditure price index, on the other hand, did not change in March, leaving its year-over-year increase at 1.6%, the smallest rise in 14 months.  Traders await clues on the Fed’s global economic outlook as the central bank’s policymaking board meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts do not anticipate any major changes from Fed officials who signaled last month they would not raise interest rates in 2019. Since the Fed’s March meeting, U.S. economic data has shown expansion has continued despite some slowing since late 2018. Last Friday, the government said first-quarter gross domestic product grew at a 3.2% pace, a figure bolstered largely by a surge in inventories and exports. Speculators raised their long dollar positions to $37.21 billion last week, the highest level since December 2015, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released late Friday.

919,Mueller says former Trump adviser Flynn's cooperation 'otherwise complete' - Reuters,"March 13, 2019 /  1:15 AM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn has completed his cooperation with the special counsel’s Russia investigation, although he is still aiding another federal probe, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The disclosure came in a joint court filing between Flynn’s lawyers and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office in which they asked for another delay in Flynn’s sentencing, citing his ongoing cooperation with the other federal investigation. The other investigation is a case brought by prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA) against Flynn’s former business partner, Bijan Rafiekian, for unregistered lobbying on behalf of Turkey. Rafiekian has pleaded not guilty and Flynn could be a witness at a trial scheduled to begin in July. “While the defendant remains in a position to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, and could testify in the EDVA case should it proceed to trial, in the government’s view his cooperation is otherwise complete,” Mueller wrote in the filing. The comment is the latest sign that Mueller may be winding up his 22-month probe into the links between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.   Flynn and Mueller’s office had been given a deadline of March 13 to update U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan about Flynn’s cooperation. The deadline was set in December when Sullivan excoriated Flynn, including by suggesting he may have committed treason, and recommended he put off Flynn’s sentencing until his cooperation was complete and he could get full credit for it. In Tuesday’s filing, Flynn’s lawyers asked to report back again to Sullivan in 90 days. Flynn has been cooperating with Mueller since pleading guilty in December 2017 to lying to FBI agents about his conversations in late 2016 with Sergei Kislyak, then Russia’s ambassador in Washington, about U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow by the administration of Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. The conversations took place between Trump’s November 2016 election victory and his inauguration in January 2017. The indictment against Rafiekian accuses him of working with Turkish government officials on a secret plan to return Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is living in exile in Pennsylvania, to Turkey — all without registering as a lobbyist as is required by law. Flynn worked with Rafiekian, a former director at the U.S. Export-Import Bank, on that project.

920,U.S. missile defense budget cut as North Korea pushes ahead - Reuters,"March 12, 2019 /  8:34 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Just when it looks like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may restart his ballistic missile testing program, U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed trimming the missile defense budget, as one set of deterrents is delayed by two years. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency - charged with developing, testing and fielding a ballistic missile defense system - will delay the expansion of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system by two years because of a delay in the redesign of the Raytheon Co-made “kill vehicle” the system uses. A “kill vehicle” pops off the top of the defending missile above the Earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead. The GMD is a network of radars, anti-ballistic missiles based in Alaska and California, and other equipment designed to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMS. The expansion of the field of interceptors in Alaska from 44 ground-based interceptors, or GBIs, to 64 had been slated for completion in 2023. But the delay, due to technical issues and not connected to the cut in the agency’s budget, now means that the placement of the additional 20 interceptors will not be operational until 2025, the MDA said on Tuesday. “The important thing is to get it right, and if we’re going to build more GBI’s, we want to put the best kill vehicle on the top of it,” said Tom Karako, a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. At the same time, North Korea has been pushing ahead with its nuclear weapons program after a summit meeting between Kim and Trump in Hanoi ended abruptly on Feb. 28 without an agreement on denuclearization. New activity has been detected at a North Korean ICBM plant, South Korean media said on Thursday, as Trump said he would be “very disappointed” if Pyongyang rebuilt a rocket site. In the budget, the Missile Defense Agency, or MDA, saw its appropriation cut by $1 billion to $9.4 billion. Michelle Atkinson, chief financial officer of the MDA, told reporters, “What you are seeing in ‘20 actually looks like a decrease, but it’s really just the declining funding,” as the agency comes off recent financial injections. Trump’s smaller request comes on the heels of a significant budget boost last year after several North Korean missile tests. The MDA projected a budget of $9.2 billion in 2021, and $9.1 billion in 2022, continuing the trend of declining funding. One Pentagon-wide effort in lasers that could be used to defeat missiles saw investment slow dramatically. After nearly doubling just the MDA’s budget for directed energy from $109 million in 2018 to $224 million in 2019, the Pentagon as a whole plans to invest only $235 million in the technology in fiscal 2020. Among other proposals included in a recently published Missile Defense Review is one involving lasers mounted on drones - aimed at stopping missiles just after takeoff in what is called the boost phase. During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable, flying at its slowest speed, easily detected by the heat from its engines and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the Earth’s atmosphere.

921,Texas Republican opposes Trump plan to fund border wall with U.S. defense funds - Reuters,"March 12, 2019 /  11:40 PM / 2 months ago","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican on the U.S. House Armed Services Committee said on Tuesday he opposed President Donald Trump’s plan to use $7 billion from the military budget to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Representative Mac Thornberry said he backs the wall, but not with Pentagon funds, calling Trump’s overall $750 billion defense budget request “the bare minimum” of what the U.S. military needs. “There are things you can’t do if you fund non-defense items with defense dollars, and I don’t think that’s a good idea whatever the merits of the other program,” Thornberry, a Republican representing the Texas Panhandle, said at a roundtable with journalists. The comments from Thornberry, a former chairman of the Armed Services panel, underscored the bipartisan opposition facing the budget Trump sent to Congress on Monday, even among those who back many of his programs. Democrats dismissed the budget proposal as dead on arrival. Thornberry also questioned Trump’s request for $165 billion of the Pentagon’s war-fighting account, nearly three times last year’s $60 billion allocation, and widely seen as an attempt to spend more on the military without having to reach an agreement with Democrats on spending for domestic programs. “I don’t think this is the Pentagon’s idea,” Thornberry said, instead calling for the two sides to negotiate a spending agreement. Thornberry joined many of his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats in disputing the wisdom of steep cuts at the State Department - Trump proposed reducing spending on diplomacy by 23 percent and slashing more than 30 percent from foreign aid. “We need the State Department,” he added. Separately, Congress is on the verge of approving a resolution to reject Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the southern border as a way to get money to build the wall - and keep a campaign promise - without lawmakers’ approval.

925,Sterling holds gains vs dollar before cenbank meeting - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  8:17 AM / in 8 days","2 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Sterling rose to a three-day high against the dollar on Monday but was little changed against other major currencies before a central bank policy meeting this week. Markets do not expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates until early 2020. “The general weakness in the dollar is contributing to the pound’s strength and the moves may be exaggerated in a thin market,” said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFG based in London. Against the dollar, the pound gained as much as 0.7 percent to $1.2945 but was steady against the euro and the Japanese yen.  With Japan out for a week of holidays, traders are worried the absence of Tokyo, one of the world’s top five currency trading centres, might fuel some exaggerated moves in foreign exchange markets. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows. Despite the pound’s gains against the dollar, net positions by hedge funds in sterling slipped back into negative territory, according to the latest data.

926,UPDATE 2-Tourist arrivals in Colombo to drop by 50 percent after bombings -Sri Lanka tourism chief - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  10:06 AM / 8 days ago","2 Min Read(Adds estimate of lost revenues) By Nafisa Eltahir DUBAI, April 29 (Reuters) - Tourist arrivals in Colombo will fall by 50 percent over the next two months following the Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 250 people, Sri Lanka’s Tourism Bureau Chairman Kishu Gomes predicted on Monday. Tourist arrivals in areas outside Colombo are likely to fall by about 30 percent as a result of the attacks, Gomes told reporters at a travel conference in Dubai. Sri Lanka was facing lost tourism revenues of about $750 million this year, he told Reuters. SriLankan Airlines’ chief executive Vipula Gunatilleka told Reuters that the carrier had a 10 percent increase in cancellations last week and expects that number to rise. A collapse in tourism following the attacks on churches and hotels would deal a severe blow to the island’s economy and financial markets, and potentially force it to seek further assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Tourism was Sri Lanka’s third largest and fastest growing source of foreign currency last year, after private remittances and textile and garment exports, accounting for almost $4.4 billion or 4.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2018.[nL3N2255A3 Gomes said the tourism bureau had targeted 2.5 million visitors in 2019. “We will probably reach about 2 million,” Gomes told reporters. “We are looking at providing some concessions to the industry for them to be able to maintain their viability for the next few months.” Gomes said confidence could return if the military is able to give assurances on security. “If the military can come out over the next few days and make a strong statement with respect to security that’s when we will obviously offer a bit of confidence and try and work against that anticipation,” the tourism chief said.

928,Uber quizzed on growth at IPO roadshow in London - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  2:25 PM / 8 days ago","4 Min Read* Uber aiming for valuation of $80.5 billion to $91.5 billion * Held first investor presentation in London * Questions focused on growth, costs and culture By Clara Denina  and Simon Jessop LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi sought to persuade money managers in London that the loss-making ride hailing firm’s growth plans justified a valuation of up to $91.5 billion in an initial public offering (IPO). In the ballroom at Claridge’s, the five-star hotel in London’s wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened on Monday to Khosrowshahi and CFO Nelson Chai talk about the company’s plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping. Uber is trying to show investors that it can shift from being simply a ride-hailing service to a technology platform for services ranging from delivering groceries and take-away meals to organising freight transportation. “While they didn’t call themselves Amazon, they made several references to their platform and how they intend to build that out,” said one investor who attended the hour-long presentation but declined to be named. Uber reported on Friday that it was aiming for a valuation of between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion, less than the $120 billion investment bankers told the company last year it could fetch. It also disclosed that it made a loss of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The lower valuation comes after the poor performance of smaller rival Lyft Inc, whose shares are down around 20 percent from when the company listed last month. After widespread media coverage of Lyft’s IPO marketing, Uber appears to be aiming for a more discreet roadshow. Investors were not told the presentation’s venue until around three hours before it began, and attendees all had to show government-issued identification before being granted admission with media firmly barred. A second investor who also declined to be named, complained that the event was relatively brief, saying they didn’t have a chance to ask many questions. A source working on the roadshow said the presentation - the only one for investors outside of the U.S. - lasted only around 10 minutes, with another 50 spent on questions and answers. As well as growth and cost-control, several questions focused on the company’s culture and business practices following a string of embarrassing scandals. Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. In London, the transport authority refused to renew Uber’s licence in September 2017 citing safety concerns, though it was granted a 15-month probationary operating licence last June, telling a court it had improved its procedures. “The CEO was very impressive and their governance is much better now, they’ve done so much in a short space of time,” said the first investor. Khosrowshahi took the role in Aug. 2017, succeeding co-founder Travis Kalanick. The Uber IPO, which is expected to price on May 9 according to people familiar with the matter, would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014. The Uber IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs & Co and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

Hopes of a trade resolution and dovish Federal Reserve this year has been powering the benchmark index, which crossed its record high of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21 for the first time during the session. A Commerce Department report showed domestic consumer spending rose by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but price pressures remained muted. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, remained steady at 0.1% in March. “We are coming off a weak patch in the consumer sector, so you have to take the data with a grain of salt, the sector was hit by the partial government shutdown, so some of this strength is a rebound from that,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “There’s a little bit of caution, we’ve got a lot of information coming down the pipe this week, especially the Fed meeting.” The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its interest rate decision at the end of a two-day meeting, starting Tuesday. Interest-rate sensitive financials rose 1.02%, the most among the 11 major sectors. In yet another busy week for earnings, about 160 S&P 500 companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc, are due to report their quarterly reports. Analysts now expect profits of S&P 500 companies to fall 0.2%, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted tariff spat between the two countries. At 9:52 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.42 points, or 0.03%, at 26,534.91, the S&P 500 was up 2.55 points, or 0.09%, at 2,942.43 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.67 points, or 0.02%, at 8,148.07. The healthcare sector fell 0.37%, weighing the most on markets, amid ongoing concerns of potential regulatory changes to the healthcare policy. Boeing Co dipped 0.3%. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg will meet Boeing shareholders for the first time on Monday since two fatal crashes that led to the 737 MAX’s grounding worldwide. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.41-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 29 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 49 new highs and nine new lows.

932,U.S. immigration agency to close its overseas offices - Reuters,"March 12, 2019 /  3:53 PM / 2 months ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration is planning to close the U.S. immigration agency’s overseas locations, according to current and former officials and an internal memo, in a move affecting offices that currently handle family visa requests, international adoptions and other tasks. The move is the latest from an administration that has worked to limit both legal and illegal immigration since Trump took office in January 2017, including cuts to the U.S. refugee program and heightened vetting of U.S. visa applications. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Francis Cissna, in an email message to agency employees, announced plans for closure of the international field offices. The plans called for shifting those duties to U.S.-based agency offices and American consulates and embassies abroad. The agency, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, currently operates 23 offices overseas, scattered across Latin America, Europe and Asia, according to the agency’s website. The agency offices carry out services including: helping American citizens who want to bring relatives to the United States; processing refugee applications; enabling overseas citizenship applications; and assisting Americans who want to adopt foreign children, according to its website.  The international offices can also process naturalizations of U.S. military service members who are not already U.S. citizens. USCIS officers abroad also look for fraud in visa applications and provide technical immigration advice to other U.S. government officials. On Monday, senior USCIS officials told employees within its Refugee Asylum and International Operations division that the agency had decided to close its overseas posts, one current and one former official said. The closures will happen over the next year and some of the offices’ tasks likely will be shifted to the State Department, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  “Change can be difficult and can cause consternation,” Cissna wrote, but said the agency is committed to implementing “as smooth a transition as possible.” In places where USCIS does not have overseas posts, the State Department already carries out some of its duties, such as replacing green cards for American legal permanent residents who have lost theirs. International USCIS staff provide support to U.S. officials who travel abroad to interview refugee applicants. The administration has put in place new barriers for asylum seekers, barred citizens of several Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States and pushed new rules that would make it harder for low-income immigrants to become legal permanent American residents. Advocates expressed concern that the move to close down overseas offices would create additional roadbocks for vulnerable applicants. “They are doing an across-the-board effort to dismantle the capacity of this country to process refugees and immigrants legally,” said Mark Hetfield, president of the U.S. refugee assistance organization HIAS. “It is not consistent with what President Trump said in the State of the Union (address), which is that he wants immigrants to come here, that he wants them to come here legally.”  “This is another example of the administration pulling up the drawbridge,” Hetfield added. Leon Rodriguez, USCIS director under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama, said the shift may have been aimed at cutting costs and that most duties now performed internationally by USCIS likely will be delegated to U.S. consulates abroad. “Symbolically it is retreating from an international presence,” Rodriguez said. Agency spokeswoman Jessica Collins said by email: “As we have internally shared, USCIS is in preliminary discussions to consider shifting its international USCIS office workloads to USCIS domestic offices in the United States and, where practicable, to U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.” “The goal of any such shift would be to maximize USCIS resources that could then be reallocated, in part, to backlog reduction efforts,” Collins said. The agency will work closely with the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security “to ensure no interruption in the provision of immigration services to affected applicants and petitioners,” Collins added. USCIS has in the past decided to close individual offices based on demand for its services. The agency previously announced that its Moscow field office will permanently close at the end of this month, citing a “significant decrease in workload.” Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington and Mica Rosenberg in New York; Additional reporting by Kristina Cooke in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Trott and Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

934,Ticking clock may save Trump from impeachment in Congress - Reuters,"March 12, 2019 /  11:04 AM / 2 months ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A momentous question hanging over Washington is whether investigations into President Donald Trump will prompt the U.S. Congress to try to remove him from office through the impeachment process set out in the U.S. Constitution. The answer could be significantly influenced by the clock. With the 2020 presidential and congressional election campaigns already gearing up, the political calendar could dictate whether initiating the time-consuming impeachment process is even plausible, Democratic and Republican lawmakers said. An emerging sentiment among some lawmakers is that by the time a president is nearing or in the last year of a four-year term, voters in the next election, not Congress, should determine whether he stays or goes, even amid allegations of wrongdoing. The House of Representatives, which would initiate any impeachment bid against the Republican Trump, is controlled by Democrats. Republicans control the Senate, which would conduct a trial and then vote on whether to remove Trump if the House impeaches him for any “high crimes and misdemeanors,” as the Constitution specifies. [nL1N20H1WX] A Republican-led House voted to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1998, midway through his second term in office, and the Senate voted not to remove him in 1999. Under the Constitution, presidents are barred from seeking a third term. Asked whether Congress should begin impeachment actions against Trump if it means doing so late this year or into 2020, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat, told Reuters, “Well, the (presidential) race is next year, so I would think it would not make sense perhaps to do it in an election year.” “But the year before, I think is fair game,” added Feinstein, who like all Senate Democrats at the time voted to acquit Clinton of the perjury and obstruction of justice counts approved by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump is unfit to be president but she is “not for impeachment.” “Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country,” Pelosi said in a Washington Post interview published on Monday. “And he’s just not worth it.” Representative Steve Chabot, one of 13 House Republicans who prosecuted Clinton’s impeachment charges before the Senate, said in an interview, “The closer one gets to an election, I think the bar goes up as to what one considers to be impeachable.” As an election nears, “I think there is an inherent consideration that perhaps the voters should decide this,” added Chabot, a House Judiciary Committee member. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is preparing to submit to U.S. Attorney General William Barr a report on his investigation into whether Trump’s 2016 campaign conspired with Russia and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Several congressional committees have launched their own investigations. Trump has denied obstruction of justice and collusion with Moscow.  The Clinton impeachment process ran five months from the release of the independent counsel report that prompted the House to act until his Senate acquittal. Even though the Nov. 3, 2020, election is roughly 20 months away, numerous Democrats have kicked off campaigns to win the right to challenge Trump, who is seeking re-election. The state-by-state contests to decide the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees begin Feb. 3, with the Iowa caucuses. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who testified before the House Judiciary Committee during Clinton’s impeachment process, said of the current Congress: “They’ve basically got a sweet spot of a year” to impeach and hold a Senate trial, if lawmakers deem those actions necessary. Turley told an American Bar Association conference in New Orleans, “No one is going to tolerate an impeachment months before an election, when the president is on the campaign trail.” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, whose panel would be instrumental in drafting any articles of impeachment, has said he believes Trump has committed obstruction of justice, but that it is too soon to decide on impeachment. “We do not now have the evidence all sorted out,” Nadler told ABC’s “This Week” program on March 3. “Before you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public that it ought to happen,” Nadler added. Only two presidents, Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been impeached by the House. Neither was removed. In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Johnson was impeached in 1868 after firing his secretary of war, only to be acquitted by the Senate. President Richard Nixon resigned amid the Watergate scandal in 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved articles of impeachment but before the full House had a chance to vote. Regardless of whether impeachment is pursued, Democrats and even some fellow Republicans noted the importance of congressional oversight of Trump. Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a Judiciary Committee member, said in an interview that the “oversight function is the critical thing right now.” Raskin added, “Timing is obviously going to be a subsidiary factor along with the character of the offenses that have been discovered.” Timing, Raskin said, “becomes more of a factor” in impeachment as elections near. Chabot offered some advice to his fellow Judiciary Committee members: “Move forward with great caution.” Chabot said if there is evidence that Trump “colluded with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to steal an election - if that really happened - then he ought to be impeached, as far as I’m concerned.” Chabot quickly added that he doubts there will be such evidence. Democratic Representative Joe Courtney said in an interview impeachment “would probably be a very hard thing for the average American to swallow if we’ve got an election” looming with Trump on the ballot. “Having said that,” Courtney added, “there are certain circumstances, which I don’t think we’re in right now - sometimes you just have to do what you have to do if the country’s at great risk.” Reporting by Richard Cowan in Washington; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in New Orleans; Editing by Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

935,"Strong U.S. growth, weak inflation leave Fed stuck happily on hold - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  5:46 PM / 8 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its policy meeting this week as policymakers balance recent stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth against sluggish inflation. Officials have given no signal in recent weeks of any change to the U.S. central bank’s benchmark overnight lending rate, currently set in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent. Markets have bet heavily the Fed’s “patient” approach means just that - with rates on hold until a run of good or bad news about the economy provides a compelling reason to move. Data compiled by CME Group put the odds the Fed leaves rates unchanged this week at 97 percent. “We do not expect a big change in tone,” compared to the Fed’s mid-March policy statement, with policymakers likely to be “more upbeat on growth, though with a more cautious reading of recent inflation developments,” JP Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a preview of this week’s meeting. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is due to release its latest statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday after the end of a two-day meeting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference shortly after. In the weeks since the Fed’s March meeting, most of the incoming U.S. data has surprised in a positive way, diminishing the likelihood officials might be compelled to cut rates as President Donald Trump has demanded. (Graphic: The Fed's split decision  link: tmsnrt.rs/2GQbzq1). The gap in interest rates between different types of bonds, which narrowed in late March in what could be construed as a growing concern about recession, has since become larger as recession concerns eased. Gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 3.2 percent for the first three months of the year, comparable to last year’s pace. The 3 percent growth achieved in 2018 surprised many at the central bank, and in their March statement officials said they thought the economy had slowed in the first weeks of this year. After adding a meager 33,000 jobs in February, U.S. employers added nearly 200,000 in March. The S&P 500 index also hit a new record high and U.S. retail sales rebounded in March after a lull. “The GDP figures – along with the strong rebound in retail sales and durable goods orders in March – are a testament to the economy’s resilience,” analysts at Oxford Economics wrote last week. It is the type of data, in fact, that until a few weeks ago might have set the stage for an interest rate increase.  But a round of volatility in stock and bond markets late last year, coupled with weak inflation and signs of a global economic slowdown, prompted the Fed to change its plans for further hikes and shift to a strategy of staying on hold until something changes. The Fed raised rates four times last year, and as late as December envisioned more increases this year. Inflation in particular continues to fall short of the Fed’s 2 percent goal, and was just 1.5 percent on an annualized basis in the most recent report. Some officials, most notably Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, have said they also feel inflation expectations are nearing uncomfortably low levels. Fed officials watch different measures of inflation expectations almost as closely as the actual inflation numbers, and view them as central to the future rate of price increases. That’s a strong reason, analysts say, for the Fed to hold off on rate hikes until it’s clear inflation is moving higher. Faced with the “dichotomy” of continuing economic growth and below-target inflation, “the Fed should keep policy on hold at its May FOMC meeting as it navigates the tug-of-war,” between the two, analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote.

Hopes of a trade resolution, upbeat earnings and a dovish Fed have been powering a rally in the benchmark index this year. The index crossed its record high of 2,940.91 hit on Sept. 21 for the first time this year, restoring investors’ faith in the decade-long bull run. A Commerce Department report showed U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but price pressures remained muted, with a key inflation measure posting its smallest annual gain in 14 months. Tame inflation may lead the central bank to cut interest rates, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said in a television interview on Monday. “We’re in a sweet spot where the rates are low and the economy is strong and there is no possibility of rates rising, and that is an environment that markets like,” said Paul Brigandi, managing director and head of trading at Direxion in New York. “The strength of the consumer and the overall economy doing well leads to strength in banks as a strong consumer leads to more lending activity.” Financial companies rose 1.41%, leading gains among the 11 major S&P sectors, while the banking sector gained 2.12%. The Federal Reserve starts a two-day meeting on Tuesday, at the end of which a decision on interest rates will be announced. In yet another busy week of earnings, about 160 S&P 500 companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc, are set to report their quarterly results. Analysts now expect profits of S&P 500 companies to fall just 0.2%, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted tariff spat between the two countries.

937,Alibaba to pay $250 million to settle lawsuit over pre-IPO warning on counterfeiting - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  1:55 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Monday it will pay $250 million to settle a U.S. lawsuit faulting the Chinese e-commerce company for concealing a regulatory warning about its ability to stop counterfeiting before it went public in 2014. The lawsuit accused Alibaba of securities fraud for failing to disclose it had met with China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce on July 16, 2014, two months before the company’s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba’s American Depositary Shares slid 12.8 percent on Jan. 28-29, 2015, after the SAIC issued a white paper based on concerns raised at the meeting, saying many products sold on Alibaba websites were fake or infringed trademarks. The white paper also said the SAIC delayed releasing its findings so the IPO would not be affected. Monday’s proposed class-action settlement covers investors in Alibaba ADS and ADS options in the 4-1/2 months preceding the release of the white paper, which was later withdrawn. The accord, which requires court approval, also resolves claims against Alibaba officials including billionaire founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma. Alibaba denied wrongdoing. It said the settlement ends all pending securities litigation against the company, its executive officers and its directors. In court papers, the plaintiffs’ lawyers called the accord “inherently fair, reasonable, and adequate,” citing potential hurdles in showing that Alibaba made false statements and intended to commit fraud. The lawyers may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement fund for legal fees, the papers show. They did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment. The Chinese company has long faced accusations that its online platforms are a haven for counterfeiters, including in lawsuits by luxury brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. Alibaba, Amazon.com Inc, eBay Inc and other such companies have policies banning counterfeiting, and highlighted their investments to thwart the practice. On April 3, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on online counterfeiting, saying global transactions in fake and pirated goods could reach $500 billion annually.  The case is In re Alibaba Group Holding Limited Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-md-02631.

938,Iraq will 'cooperate' with Siemens on power grid plan - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  5:18 PM / 8 days ago","1 Min ReadBAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s government said on Monday it would “cooperate” with German engineering group Siemens in a potential deal to develop the country’s power grid, but gave no further details. Siemens and U.S. rival General Electric have been competing for a possible $15 million deal to develop Iraq’s electricity infrastructure. “The (Iraqi) cabinet decided to implement a road map for the electricity sector in cooperation with Siemens,” the government said in a statement, without elaborating. It did not mention GE and did not say whether Siemens would be the only company involved in the power grid development. Siemens had been favorite to win a contract to supply 11 gigawatts of power-generation equipment in the possible $15 billion deal, though the Financial Times reported in October that the German group may have to share the work with GE after pressure from the U.S. administration.

939,European shares end higher as Spanish stocks recover poise - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  4:43 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares closed marginally higher on Monday led by gains for Banco Santander, as investors chose to focus on the positives of a weekend win for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s ruling socialists in Spain’s third election in four years. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 0.08 percent stronger, with most regional indices ending in positive territory. Spain’s IBEX, down nearly 1 percent earlier in the session, finished up 0.12 percent as losses for utilities were outweighed by the rally in the shares of the country’s major lenders. Sanchez’s pro-European PSOE won Sunday’s election, but was short of a parliamentary majority, meaning it will need the help of regional parties, or the centre-right, to form a coalition government.  “It looks like we are going to be able to continue with a government under PSOE,” said Bert Colijn, a euro zone-focused senior economist at ING.  “I would say it’s quite a positive story. I think that in general being pro-European is good for reform and policy and his being pro-euro zone would help markets.”   Jitters around the result of the poll, added to weak euro zone economic sentiment data, had pushed markets lower in morning trade in Europe.  But the gains for Santander, leading banks across Europe higher, along with a dip in Spanish bond market yields, pointed to a more positive take on the events from investors. Europe’s banking sector index rose almost 1 percent, with HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo and BNP Paribas all among the top ten boosts to the broader STOXX 600 index. French drugmaker Sanofi also rose 1.7 percent after positive U.S. and European regulator decisions on cholesterol and diabetes drugs co-developed by the company. Airbus gained 0.95 percent as Middle East carrier  Flydubai’s chairman said the airline could order Airbus A320neos as replacements for Boeing 737 MAX jets. A fall in German drug-maker Bayer, as well as oil majors tracking a decline in crude prices, kept gains in check. Bayer shares, which were trading ex-dividend, fell as a majority of shareholders rejected the management’s actions on Friday, fuelling market talk the company could become a takeover target. About 30 billion euros have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto, which the company finished taking over last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup.     Market participants will watch out for a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Chinese factory data this week for further clues on policy direction in the world’s largest economies.

940,"U.S. consumer spending roars back, but inflation tame - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  12:38 PM / in 8 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles, but price pressures remained muted, with a key inflation measure posting its smallest annual gain in 14 months. The surge in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Monday sets a stronger base for growth in consumption heading into the second quarter after it slowed sharply in the first three months of the year. It further allayed concerns about the economy’s health, which had been brought to the fore by a temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve last month. Tame inflation, however, supported the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year. Fed officials are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the economy and deliberate on the future course of monetary policy. The U.S. central bank in March dropped forecasts for any interest rate increases this year, halting a three-year policy tightening campaign. The Fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018. “The economy is in a sweet spot for now with not enough inflation to cause the Fed to raise rates, and with inflation  not low enough to worry Fed officials that economic demand is weakening, which could require rate cuts,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, surged 0.9 percent. That was the biggest rise since August 2009 and was also driven by increased healthcare expenditures. Spending rose 0.1 percent in February.  Data for January was revised up to show consumer spending rising 0.3 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain. The release of the February spending data was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending jumping 0.7 percent in March.  When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 0.7 percent in March. This so-called real consumer spending was unchanged in February. The data was included in last Friday’s first-quarter gross domestic product report.  March’s surge in real consumer spending suggested an acceleration in consumption was likely in the second quarter. Consumer spending increased at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the slowest in a year. The overall economy grew at a 3.2 percent rate last quarter. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on wall Street rose, lifting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite to record highs.  In March, spending on goods rebounded 1.7 percent, with outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as cars shooting up 2.3 percent. Spending on goods fell 0.5 percent in February. Outlays on services increased 0.5 percent last month, driven by healthcare spending, after rising 0.4 percent in February. Inflation was benign, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components unchanged in March after edging up 0.1 percent in February. That lowered the year-on-year increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6 percent, the smallest increase since January 2018, from 1.7 percent in February. The core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. It hit the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target in March last year for the first time since April 2012.  The low inflation readings caught the attention of the White House, where President Donald Trump has railed against the Fed for tightening monetary policy. Trump has called for rate cuts, tweeting earlier this month that there was “almost no inflation.” The Trump administration blamed the economy’s stumble at the turn of the year on the rate hikes.  On Monday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said slowing inflation opened the door for possible rate cuts. Economists, however, are not convinced. “These below-target rates of inflation will likely be acknowledged by the Fed at this week’s meeting, but we still think it unlikely that the Fed would be prompted into rate cuts by weak inflation readings alone,” said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. With personal income ticking up 0.1 percent in March after rising 0.2 percent in February, there are concerns that the current pace of consumer spending might be unsustainable. Incomes have been almost flat since surging last December.  But a strong labor market and still very high savings are seen underpinning spending. Wages rose 0.4 percent in March after advancing 0.3 percent in the prior month. Savings fell to $1.03 trillion in March from $1.16 trillion in February.

Major U.S. indexes advanced modestly, with the S&P 500 topping its intraday record of 2,940.91 set on Sept. 21 with a session high of 2,946.23. The benchmark index posted a record close last week but has been unable to pierce the intraday mark. Economic data showed U.S. consumer spending surged 0.9% in March, the most in more than 9-1/2 years, although inflation remained subdued, supporting the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent decision to hold off on further interest rate hikes this year. Sentiment for stocks on Wall Street was also buoyed by the brightening picture of corporate profits, putting some concerns about a possible earnings recession at bay. Refinitiv data showed a 0.2% decline in earnings reports to date for the quarter, a solid improvement from the 2% decline expected at the start of the month. “Earnings have been OK to good,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “And, when you get that lower inflation number as well, which I think suggests no interest rate rise, there are just not enough reasons right now that investors see to sell stocks.” The Fed is due to meet this week and will issue its latest policy announcement on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.01 point, or -0%, to 26,543.32, the S&P 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.10%, to 2,942.85 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.24 points, or 0.16%, to 8,159.64. European shares were slightly higher in choppy trade, as uncertainty related to the formation of a government in Spain and weak euro zone economic sentiment data exacerbated fears over slowing global growth kept gains in check. Spain’s IBEX 35 index underperformed its peers, but had moved near the unchanged mark after falling nearly 1%, and Spanish government bond yields dipped after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez overcame a challenge from right-wing nationalists in elections on Sunday. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.10% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12%. U.S. Treasury yields rose in the wake of the consumer spending data, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.527%, from 2.504% late on Friday. The dollar index fell 0.02%, with the euro up 0.14% to $1.1164. Oil prices pared early losses of more than $1 a barrel, after dropping nearly 3% on Friday when the market tumbled after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that producer group OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran. U.S. crude fell 0.25% to $63.14 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.64, up 0.01% on the day. Additional reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Dan

Clinton, who did not campaign in Wisconsin during the 2016 general election campaign, also fell short in two other traditionally “blue wall” states - Michigan and Pennsylvania - by narrow margins, helping give Trump his path to victory in one of the greatest upsets in modern American politics. The 2020 Democratic National Convention will be held July 13-16 at the Fiserv Forum arena in downtown Milwaukee, marking the first time a Midwestern city other than Chicago has hosted the event in more than a century, party officials said. Miami and Houston were also considered as candidates for the convention. But the choice of Milwaukee, the largest city and economic heart of Wisconsin, reflected Democrats’ determination to reclaim the mantle as the party of the working class in America’s rustbelt. “We will show in 490 days that the Midwest is the opportunity belt,” Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez told a news conference at the Fiserv Forum, where the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association play. “We’re ready to host this convention, and we are ready to make sure that all of America knows how much we care about the working people in our community,” Mayor Tom Barrett said.  The announcement comes at a time of tension between moderate, establishment Democrats, whose success in the 2018 November midterm races enabled the party to regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives, and more liberal Democrats. This progressive wing is dominated by younger figures who see a chance to swing the party, and nation as a whole, to the left. Governor Tony Evers, who defeated two-term Republican Scott Walker in the 2018 race, seemed eager to appeal to both wings of the party, pointing to Wisconsin as “a place where we value diversity, inclusivity and where we value young people.” While modern national political conventions serve largely as coronations of their parties’ respective nominees - who have clinched the requisite delegate votes in advance during the primaries - the events play a key role in showcasing a party’s message and highlighting up-and-coming political personalities. More than a dozen Democrats have announced that they are seeking the nomination in the state-by-state contests that kick off in February 2020 with Iowa’s caucuses followed by the New Hampshire primary. The unusually crowded and diverse field includes five women serving in the U.S. Senate and the party’s first openly gay candidate. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist and U.S. senator from Vermont who rose to national prominence when he ran in 2016, and Joe Biden, a former U.S. senator and vice president who has not formally declared but is expected to run, have emerged as front-runners in recent opinion polls. The Republican National Convention will be held in Charlotte, North Carolina, more than a month later, Aug. 24-27.  Democrats had carried Wisconsin in presidential elections going back to the 1980s, until Clinton narrowly lost the state.   Some Republicans ridiculed the choice: “Four years too late, Democrats go to Wisconsin,” Kellyanne Conway, one of Trump’s senior advisers, wrote on Twitter. The convention is expected to generate some $200 million in economic activity and draw about 50,000 visitors to Milwaukee, known historically as a hub of beer brewing and manufacturing, including the including the headquarters of Harley-Davidson Inc, the iconic motorcycle brand.

946,"Doomed with Democrats, Trump's budget boosts Pentagon, targets safety net - Reuters","March 11, 2019 /  10:05 AM / 2 months ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump called on Monday for spending more U.S. taxpayer money on the military and a U.S.-Mexico border wall, while overhauling social safety-net programs in a budget plan likely to die in Congress but live on in his 2020 re-election campaign. Like past presidential budget proposals, Trump’s plan was highly unlikely to become law. It was immediately panned by Democrats, who control the House of Representatives and blocked Trump’s push for border wall funding in a standoff that led last year to a five-week partial federal government shutdown. The $4.7 trillion plan asks for $8.6 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico - more than six times what Congress gave Trump for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than he has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year after he failed to get the money he wanted. It also includes proposals to overhaul Medicare, Medicaid and other costly social programs that help the poor and underprivileged. The budget makes no immediate progress on reducing the federal deficit or the national debt, issues once paramount to Trump’s fellow Republicans. “President Trump has somehow managed to produce a budget request even more untethered from reality than his past two,” said Democratic U.S. Representative Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that Trump’s plan “is not worth the paper it is printed on.” Acting administration budget chief Russell Vought will defend Trump’s plan before the House Budget Committee on Tuesday. “This budget contains nearly $2.7 trillion in savings, more spending reductions proposed than any administration in history,” Vought told reporters at the White House on Monday. “This budget will balance in 15 years.” Like last year’s $4.4 trillion Trump budget, which was dead on arrival on Capitol Hill, the 2020 version relies on rosy economic projections to achieve projected balance in the future. “We view the president’s 2020 budget proposal as a political priority-setting document. ... Congressional dynamics will mostly restrain requested domestic spending cuts and major changes to authorization language,” said Ed Mills, policy analyst at financial firm Raymond James in a research note. The stakes for a spending deal of some sort in Congress are high this year. On Oct. 1, when fiscal 2020 begins, a deadline also arrives for lifting the federal debt limit. Failing to do that could risk an economy-shaking U.S. government debt default. A major part of Trump’s budget is his proposed 4 percent boost in defense spending to $750 billion. It relies on using the emergency Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account - derided by conservatives as a slush fund - to skirt spending caps set out in a 2011 fiscal restraint law. Non-defense spending was held below those caps, thanks to steep proposed funding cuts to the State Department (23 percent) and Environmental Protection Agency (31 percent), among others. A senior administration official told reporters the budget would cut U.S. aid to foreign countries by $13 billion. It would also cut federal subsidies to farmers, add a user fee on e-cigarettes and end a tax credit for electric car purchases.     Tax cuts have been a priority for the Republican White House and Congress in the past two years, rather than deficit reduction. The deficit ran to $900 billion in 2019 and the national debt has ballooned to $22 trillion. The Committee for a Responsible Budget said Trump’s budget would add $10.5 trillion to the debt over a decade, and criticized the White House for what it called a “fantasy assumption” of 3 percent economic growth over that timeframe. Unless the White House and Congress reach a spending deal, automatic spending caps from the 2011 law will kick in on Oct. 1, adding another level of urgency to the fall deadlines. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said House Democrats would put out their own budget proposal around the first week of April and that he hoped for a deal with the Senate. “The ingredients ... are there to make a reasonable deal. And the White House is the wild card,” he said.

947,"Beto O'Rourke heading to Iowa, fueling speculation about White House bid - Reuters","March 12, 2019 /  2:32 AM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke is heading to the early presidential voting state of Iowa this weekend, fuelling speculation that the Democrat is poised to enter the White House race. O’Rourke said last week he had made a decision about whether to seek the Democratic nomination for president. A trip to Iowa on Saturday, where the first votes in the nominating contest will be cast in February, suggests his entry into the race is imminent. In an announcement posted on Twitter, Eric Giddens, an Iowa Democrat who is running in a special election for a state senate seat, said his campaign workers and O’Rourke will be urging students this Saturday at the University of Northern Iowa to vote in his election race. The tweet by Giddens was accompanied by a video of O’Rourke speaking from his home city of El Paso, Texas, wearing a University of Northern Iowa baseball cap and urging UNI students to vote for Giddens. “Supporting him for state Senate is the way that we get Iowa, and by extension, this country, back on the right track,” O’Rourke says. “UNI, we’re counting on you, and we’re looking forward to seeing you soon. Adios.” Chris Evans, a spokesman for O’Rourke, confirmed in an email to Reuters that O’Rourke will be in Waterloo, Iowa, campaigning for Giddens on Saturday afternoon. He did not respond to requests about whether O’Rourke was planning to run for president. With its position as first in the nation status when it comes to presidential nominating battles, Iowa can sometimes make or break candidacies and is an early and frequent destination for White House hopefuls.  Other Democratic presidential candidates have already visited Iowa ahead of O’Rourke’s visit. O’Rourke, 46, rose to national prominence last year when he narrowly lost his bid to defeat Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz. O’Rourke had previously said he would decide by the end of February if he would launch a White House campaign, and speculation around his plans mounted after several high-profile public appearances. He sat for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in New York and held a rival rally last month to decry Trump’s immigration policy as the president promoted his planned border wall in El Paso. He has also visited the general election battleground state of Wisconsin. Reporting by Tim Reid; Editing by Robert BirselAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

948,"Clean Russian oil has reached Belarus via key pipeline, Moscow says - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  12:58 PM / 8 days ago","5 Min ReadMINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Clean Russian oil had reached the border with Belarus by midday on Monday, a Russian official said, five days after European refineries suspended imports because of contamination in the Druzhba pipeline.  Poland, Germany, Ukraine, Slovakia and other countries on the network suspended oil imports via the Druzhba pipeline after finding contaminants that can damage refinery equipment. “As planned, at 1200 (0900 GMT) on April 29 oil ... has reached ... the Druzhba pipeline’s Unecha border station,” Ilya Dzhus, spokesman for Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, said in a statement.  Belarus had earlier said that clean Russian oil had yet to reach its borders via the pipeline — a major source of oil supply across Europe — after tainted crude prompted several importers to halt flows last week. State-run oil company Belneftekhim said that Belarusian refineries were still running at reduced capacity, though Moscow had said it would start pumping clean crude through the Druzhba network from Monday. Negotiations with Moscow over Belneftekhim’s oil supply will continue, one of its deputy chairmen, Vladimir Sizov, told Reuters as he left talks at the Russian Energy Ministry on Monday.  The Druzhba network supplies refineries as far west as Germany. Belneftekhim spokeswoman Marina Kostyuchenko said that clean Russian oil may reach the country later than Monday.  “For now, I don’t see that it (oil) will arrive today ... Even if oil has reached the Russian side (of the border), time is needed (for it) to arrive to us,” she said.  Moscow had also said on Friday that it would take two weeks to stabilize supplies across the Druzhba network, which has northern and southern pipeline spurs.     A source with a buyer at the northern Druzhba leg on Monday said that supplies via Adamova Zastava to Poland and Germany remained halted and were not expected to resume in the short term.  The problems arose when an unidentified Russian producer contaminated oil with high levels of organic chloride, which is typically used to boost oil output but which must be separated before shipment to avoid damaging refiners’ processing units. It remains unclear how contaminants got into the pipeline system near the Russian city of Samara on the Volga river. “Clean Urals is about to reach the Belarus border, but it doesn’t solve anything. No solution. The situation is worse than it seems,” an industry source familiar with the talks told Reuters. Russia has not offered specifics about how it planned to clean out contaminated oil from the whole network. Druzhba can ship up to 1 million barrels per day, amounting to 1 percent of global crude demand.  Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin told reporters in Minsk after Friday’s talks that one option was to mix clean oil with the contaminated crude. Another is to transport clean oil by rail tankers, Russian Railways said last week. Some Western buyers last week refused to take Urals cargoes loading from the Baltic port of Ust-Luga, which also received contaminated oil. A port official and traders on Friday said loadings had resumed.  Traders working with the port told Reuters on Monday that loadings were continuing but the organic chlorides content in the crude was rising.  “It has reached around 200 ppm (parts per million) in cargoes recently loaded from the port,” one trader said. The regular ratio is about 10 ppm.  Oil flows from nearby Primorsk as well as Novorossiisk and Kozmino in Russia’s far east were not affected, traders said. In total Russia exports about 4 million barrels of oil per day.  Some European refineries have turned to supplies through other pipelines, but analysts say those routes have limited capacity. Czech oil refiner Unipetrol has asked the government to lend it crude from state reserves, with amounts to be discussed at a meeting on Monday.       Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft is investigating the matter, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday, adding that this could lead to a wider inquiry, possibly including law enforcement agencies. The pipeline issue has cut off a major supply route for Polish refineries owned by PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos, as well as plants in Germany owned by Total, Shell, Eni and Rosneft.

949,UPDATE 3-Spanish bonds strengthen after pro-European election result - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:41 AM / in 8 days","4 Min Read* Spain’s Socialists look set for government return * Spain/Germany bond yield gap tightens sharply * U.S. consumer spending increases by most in 9-1/2 years * S&P affirms Italy’s BBB rating, two notches above junk * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates pricing, adds detail on US consumer spending) By Abhinav Ramnarayan LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Spanish government bond yields dipped on Monday after the weekend’s general election in which the Socialists emerged as the strongest party, a result seen by many in the market as pro-European. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez portrayed the result as a morale booster for the European Union as he looks set to regain power after his Socialists overcame a historic challenge by right-wing nationalists in Sunday’s vote. Coalition talks are set to begin this week, but market participants anticipate a coalition of left-leaning parties to take power in Spain as the most likely outcome. “When you compare this to our worst fears for Europe, this is the most pro-European voting result you could have had,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management. “But also these parties are the more conciliatory to separatist forces, so I suspect Catalonia is going to remain an issue for the foreseeable future,” she said, referring to the thriving independence movement in the northeastern province. Spain’s 10- and 30-year bond yields, having dropped in the run-up to the vote on the back of pre-election polls, were down about two basis points on Monday. Spain’s bond yield spread over Germany was at its tightest level in nearly two weeks at 100 basis points and well off last week’s highs of 110.6 bps. The spread is heading towards the 95 bps mark which matches the tightest levels this year reached in early March. Spanish government bonds have been one of the strongest performing in the region over the past two years as the country’s impressive economic growth has pushed up its credit rating to the Single A category from two of the three main ratings agencies. Better than expected U.S. consumer spending data briefly nudged up the safe haven 10-year German Bund yield to a session high of 0.017 percent. It was last up around two basis points at zero percent. Other better-rated euro zone government bond yields rose 1-2 bps on the day. “The silver lining for Spain continues to be growth,” Barclays said in a note. “In 2019, Spain will still outperform other large euro-area economies Germany, France and Italy. Therefore, we think that markets will not react very negatively to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead.” Elsewhere, an early rally in Italian bonds — triggered by S&P Global’s decision on Friday to maintain the country’s sovereign credit rating two notches above junk — proved short-lived. Italy’s 10-year bond yield was flat at around 2.58 percent, having dropped as much as five basis points to 2.53 percent in early trade. Later in the week, inflation numbers for the euro zone, a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting and business surveys in Italy and Spain could all have an impact on markets. Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan,

952,Trump budget proposes ending electric vehicle tax credit - Reuters,"March 11, 2019 /  5:57 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House proposed on Monday eliminating a tax credit worth up to $7,500 on the purchase of new electric vehicles, a move it says would save the U.S. government $2.5 billion over a decade. Major automakers have been lobbying Congress to extend the credit that phases out after companies hit 200,000 vehicles sold. They are hopeful Congress could expand the benefit by including it in a package of extended tax provisions that would otherwise expire that could win approval this year.  Tesla Inc and General Motors Co both hit the 200,000 figure last year, but other major automakers are far from that figure. The credit consumers receive for buying Teslas fell to $3,750 on Jan. 1 and will drop to $1,875 for six months starting July 1. The credit for GM vehicles will fall to $3,750 on April 1, and then drop to $1,875 in October for six months. It will completely disappear for Tesla buyers in January 2020 and in April 2020 for GM. In November, a congressional report said 57,066 taxpayers claimed $375 million in electric vehicle tax credits in 2016. Congress previously estimated the cost of the credit at $7.5 billion between the 2018 and 2022 fiscal years. The credit enjoys strong support among Democrats in Congress, but Senator John Barrasso, a Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has proposed legislation to end it entirely. In December, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration of President Donald Trump wanted to end subsidies for electric cars and other related items, including renewable energy sources. “As a matter of our policy, we want to end all of those subsidies,” Kudlow said. “And by the way, other subsidies that were imposed during the Obama administration, we are ending, whether it’s for renewables and so forth.” Trump last year threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the company’s decision to close five North American plants and cut 15,000 jobs. The Trump 2020 budget also proposes ending funding for a Energy Department loan program that aided automakers building more fuel-efficient models, including Tesla, Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co. But the program has not funded a new loan since 2011. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is seeking $14.2 million for the deployment and development of self-driving car technologies, including testing and research to address regulatory issues. Trump’s $4.7 trillion budget, which seeks to slash funding for foreign aid and the State Department and increase spending for the military and a border wall, is expected to be rejected by Congress.

953,Alibaba pays $250 mln to settle lawsuit over pre-IPO counterfeiting warning - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  1:51 PM / in 8 days","3 Min ReadNEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Monday it will pay $250 million to settle a U.S. lawsuit faulting the Chinese e-commerce company for concealing a regulatory warning about its ability to stop counterfeiting before it went public in 2014. The lawsuit accused Alibaba of securities fraud for failing to disclose it had met with China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce on July 16, 2014, two months before the company’s $25 billion initial public offering. Alibaba’s American Depositary Shares fell 12.8 percent on Jan. 28 and 29, 2015 after the SAIC issued a white paper based on concerns raised at the meeting, saying many products sold on Alibaba websites were fake or infringed trademarks. The white paper also said the SAIC delayed releasing its findings so the IPO would not be affected. While the white paper was later withdrawn, seven proposed U.S. class-action lawsuits were filed on behalf of ADS investors over the share price decline, before being consolidated. Alibaba said it did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to the settlement, which requires court approval. Settlement papers were not immediately available. The investors’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Alibaba has long faced accusations that its online platforms are a haven for counterfeiters, including in lawsuits by luxury brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. Companies including Alibaba, Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc have policies banning counterfeiting, and highlighted their investments to thwart the practice. On April 3, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on online counterfeiting, saying global transactions in fake and pirated goods could reach $500 billion annually. The settlement covers investors in Alibaba ADS and ADS stock options from Sept. 19, 2014 through Jan. 29, 2015. The lead plaintiffs are Christine Asia Co and William Tai. The case is In re Alibaba Group Holding Limited Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-md-02631.

960,US STOCKS-Wall St set for flat open as investors await fresh earnings - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  1:11 PM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Consumer spending in March posts biggest gain since 2009 * Disney up after stellar ‘Avengers: Endgame’ movie debut * Boeing drops, CEO to face shareholders at 10 a.m. ET * Futures flat: Dow 0.03%, S&P 0.00%, Nasdaq 0.02% (Updates prices, adds comments) By Shreyashi   Sanyal April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were trading flat on Monday after hitting a closing high in the previous session, as investors waited for a fresh batch of earnings reports while sentiment was supported by upbeat consumer spending data. A Commerce Department report showed domestic consumer spending rose by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in March, but price pressures remained muted. However, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, remained steady at 0.1% in March. “We are coming off a weak patch in the consumer sector, so you have to take the data with a grain of salt, the sector was hit by the partial government shutdown, so some of this strength is a rebound from that,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “There’s a little bit of caution, we’ve got a lot of information coming down the pipe this week, especially the Fed meeting.” The Federal Open Market Committee will announce its interest rate decision at the end of a two-day meeting, starting Tuesday. In yet another busy week for earnings, about 160 S&P 500 companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc, are due to report their quarterly reports. Analysts now expect profits of S&P 500 companies to fall 0.3%, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted tariff spat between the two countries. Hopes of a trade resolution and a dovish Fed has sparked a rally in stocks from a slump late last year, putting the S&P 500 index just 0.04% shy of its all-time high of 2,940.91 points hit in September. At 8:59 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 8 points, or 0.03%. S&P 500 e-minis remained unchanged and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 1.25 points, or 0.02%. Among stocks, Walt Disney Co rose 1.5% after the debut of “Avengers: Endgame” over the weekend pushed total ticket sales for the superhero spectacle to $1.2 billion, crushing records in dozens of countries. Boeing Co dipped 0.9%. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg will meet Boeing shareholders for the first time on Monday since two fatal crashes that led to the 737 MAX’s grounding worldwide. Alphabet Inc edged up 0.2% ahead of its results after the bell, while Apple, which is set to report on Tuesday, dipped 0.1%.

961,Trump adviser: some time may pass before a third North Korea summit - Reuters,"March 10, 2019 /  4:19 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is open to a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but some time may have to go by before this takes place, Trump’s national security adviser said on Sunday. Speaking on ABC, John Bolton said the United States has no illusions about North Korea’s capabilities, but Trump remains confident in his personal relationship with the North Korean leader.  Bolton’s comments came after two U.S. think tanks and Seoul’s spy agency said last week that North Korea was rebuilding a rocket launch site at Sohae in the west of the country.  There have also been reports from South Korea’s intelligence service of new activity at a factory at Sanumdong near Pyongyang that produced North Korea’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.  Bolton declined to discuss those reports or say whether a new North Korean missile launch would scuttle engagement with the United States. He said, however, that it was a mistake to assume North Korea would “automatically” comply with its obligations. “The president’s confident in his personal relationship with Kim Jong Un. He’s invested a lot of time in trying to develop that relationship,” Bolton told ABC’s “This Week.” “He said he’s open to a third summit, none has been scheduled, and some time may have to go by.  But he’s prepared to engage again because he does think that the prospects for North Korea, which he’s been trying to persuade Kim Jong Un to accept if they denuclearized, are really quite spectacular,” Bolton said. Trump told reporters Friday he would be disappointed if Pyongyang were to resume weapons testing and reiterated his belief in his good relationship with the North Korean leader, despite the recent collapse of their second summit in Hanoi. North Korea has frozen nuclear and missile testing since 2017, and Trump has pointed to this as a positive outcome from nearly a year of high-level engagement with North Korea. In his interview with ABC and in another with Fox News Channel, Bolton appeared to rule out any partial deal with North Korea and said Trump had proposed a “big deal” at the Hanoi summit under which North Korea would completely denuclearize and also give up its chemical and biological weapons. “It’s possible that North Korea will go back and rethink the position they came in with and come back to talk to the president about the big deal,” he told Fox. Bolton called the incremental approach North Korea has sought a “ploy” to obtain sanctions relief.

962,U.S. presses India to stop buying oil from Venezuela's Maduro: envoy - Reuters,"March 10, 2019 /  11:54 AM / in 2 months","6 Min Read(Reuters) - The United States is pressing India to stop buying oil from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government, Washington’s top envoy for Venezuela said, as the Trump administration this week threatened more U.S. sanctions to cut off Maduro’s financial lifelines. “We say you should not be helping this regime. You should be on the side of the Venezuelan people,” Elliott Abrams told Reuters in an interview. The Trump administration has given the same message to other governments, Abrams said, and has made a similar argument to foreign banks and companies doing business with Maduro. Abrams described the U.S. approach as “arguing, cajoling, urging.”  The talks with India come as the United States and its regional allies, who back Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, threaten more sanctions to cut off revenue streams to Maduro’s government and force him to step down. Washington views Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader and has imposed sanctions on the country’s oil sector and announced asset freezes and visa bans targeting top government officials.  The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela’s economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country’s crude, behind the United States, which through sanctions against Maduro has handed control of much of that revenue to Guaido. Washington wants India to do the same. Oil shipments to China, another major importer of Venezuelan oil, do not generate cash because they go to pay off billions of dollars in loans made to Caracas by Beijing. The talks over Venezuela come as trade tensions rise between Washington and New Delhi, and when the United States is also pushing India to cease buying Iranian oil.  The United States is planning to end preferential trade treatment for India that allows duty-free entry for up to $5.6 billion worth of its exports to the United States.  U.S. sanctions typically block American firms from doing business with specific foreign governments or companies.  Any move by the United States to prevent purchases of Venezuelan crude would be part of a strategy known as “secondary sanctions,” in which Washington applies penalties to companies not based in the United States.  That strategy, and even the threat of using it, was vital in Washington’s pressure campaign to cut off revenue to Iran, which eventually helped force Tehran to negotiate a nuclear deal with six world powers in 2015.  But it has drawn criticism from some foreign governments that argue that the United States should not be able to force its policy decisions on firms in other countries. U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton this week put foreign banks “on notice” that they risked U.S. sanctions for hiding Venezuelan assets.      “If that leads to people to cooperate voluntarily, we’re glad,” Abrams said. Asked whether India had agreed to stop buying oil from Maduro’s government, Abrams said: “I don’t want to characterize the discussions, which continue.” The issue will be discussed on Tuesday during U.S.-India diplomatic consultations in Washington, an Indian official said, adding that India “was very cognizant of the U.S. position” on Venezuela. Abrams said there were no signs that Maduro is open to negotiations to end the political impasse with Guaido, emphasizing that any talks would need to be reached among Venezuelans. Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela’s oil minister, attended a conference in New Delhi in mid-February seeking to “double” the country’s crude exports to India while boosting Venezuelan imports of Indian refined products. He also said he was open to barter payments.     But Venezuela’s exports to India remained relatively stable in the month since the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA , meaning shipments were not nearly enough to make up for the fall in U.S. sales. Venezuela directly exported 297,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to India in February, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, which does not include barrels first shipped to other ports such as Singapore or Rotterdam. India imported 342,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude in January, and an average of 340,000 bpd last year. That was well off the more than 400,000 bpd India used to import, on average, and not nearly enough to make up for the drop in U.S. imports to 104,800 bpd in February from more than 500,000 bpd before the sanctions hit.     India is also being pressured by lawmakers from both major U.S. parties. Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted on Feb. 13 that Indian refiner Reliance Petroleum’s purchases of Venezuelan oil would undermine Guaido’s “legitimate government” and “lead to calls for secondary sanctions on Reliance.”       Albio Sires, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives’ subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, wrote to India’s ambassador in Washington on Feb. 12 expressing concern about what Sires called Venezuela’s “attempts to work around U.S. efforts to hold Maduro accountable and approach one of our strongest partners in the process.”      Venezuelan oil made up just 4.2 percent of India’s total imports in January, data show. Venezuela is also not a top foreign policy priority for India, as it is for other major buyers like Russia, said Moises Rendon of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.     “The U.S. has enough leverage to get India to pull away the relationship with Venezuela,” Rendon said. “That’s why the U.S. role here is key.”  Reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington, Marianna Parraga in Mexico City, Luc Cohen in New York, and Nidhi Verma in New Delhi; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Lisa ShumakerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

963,"Biden tops 2020 Iowa presidential poll, Sanders gains momentum - Reuters","March 10, 2019 /  2:54 AM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden topped a poll of Iowa voters on Saturday that also showed Senator Bernie Sanders gaining momentum against him in the No. 2 spot. Biden, who has not announced whether he is running in the 2020 election, is the first choice for president of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers with 27 percent in the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll. Sanders, 77, got 25 percent.  “If I’m Joe Biden sitting on the fence and I see this poll, this might make me want to jump in,” J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co, which conducted the poll, told the Des Moines Register. The newspaper’s Iowa poll has a long track record of relative accuracy in the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process. In this cycle, Iowa will hold the first contest in the Democratic race in February 2020.  Nearly 65 percent of the voters said Biden, 76, who was also a U.S. senator first elected in 1972, has more experience than any other candidate and should enter the race, while 31 percent said his time as a candidate has passed. Sanders, a progressive populist who held a rally in Iowa as the poll was being conducted last week, gained 6 percentage points from 19 percent in the group’s previous poll released in December. Biden fell 5 percentage points from 32 percent in the last poll. At least a dozen major candidates already have jumped into the Democratic contest to pick a nominee to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, and Democrats are still waiting for decisions in coming weeks from other big names such as Biden and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas. In most national polls of Democrats, Biden has a solid lead while Sanders, who lost the 2016 Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, typically is in second. In those polls, Senator Kamala Harris of California has vaulted into third ahead of other senators including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey.     In the Iowa poll, Warren was third with 9 percent of voters, and Harris was fourth with 7 percent. O’Rourke got 5 percent of voters, down 6 percentage points from December.     It was the Register’s first Iowa poll since candidates began jumping into the race at the beginning of the year. The poll also surveyed support of likely Iowa caucus-goers on issues that have dominated the early discussion and drawn support from most of the Democratic presidential contenders.  The Green New Deal, a proposal by Democrats in Congress to tackle climate change, was supported in full by 65 percent of the Democratic voters, partially by 26 percent, with 4 percent not supporting. The deal would fund government programs on clean energy and make buildings energy efficient while helping to address poverty.  Support was also measured for Medicare-for-all, a plan first proposed by Sanders in 2017, to replace the current mix of private and government financed healthcare coverage with a universal coverage plan funded solely by the government. It was supported by 49 percent of the likely caucus-goers, partially by 35 percent, with 11 percent not supporting.

969,PRECIOUS-Gold slips from more than one-week high as data lifts equities - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  10:25 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read* SPDR gold holdings at lowest since Oct. 19 * Gold specs raise net short positions in week to April 23 * Palladium off one-month peak hit earlier in the session (Updates prices) By Swati Verma April 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices slipped on Monday from a more than one-week high hit in the previous session as strong data from China and the United States buoyed stock markets, denting the appeal of bullion. Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,281.19 per ounce at 1150 GMT. U.S. gold futures shed 0.4 percent to $1,283.20 an ounce. Global shares rose, supported by data showing profits at Chinese industrial firms grew for the first time in four months and a strong reading of U.S. first quarter growth data last week. “Since quite some time it’s been a risk friendly market, with equities on the rise. Gold prices are also trading below a very important level of $1,300, which is weighing on the market,” Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said. The recent uplift in equities has led investors cut their exposure to gold, with holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, falling to its lowest since Oct. 19 at 746.69 tonnes on Friday. Holdings have fallen by over 3 percent since the beginning of this month. Speculators also increased their bearish wagers on COMEX gold in the week to April 23, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. “We remain in a very uncertain period for gold though. On the one hand, the environment is primed for gold to come under more pressure, but when we broke through $1,280 two weeks ago, any downside momentum quickly faded,” OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam said. Gold on Friday rose to its highest since April 16 at $1,288.59 and also posted its biggest weekly percentage gain in five weeks. “We saw a nice pop higher at the end of last week as the dollar softened a little on the back of the GDP data. The headline number was strong - and much better than expected - but the underlying figures are less impressive,” Erlam said. The U.S. GDP data instigated questions about the actual economic strength of the country, since the quarterly growth figures were largely driven by temporary factors like a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015. Investors are now looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting and a raft of global data including on U.S. core inflation and payrolls this week. Elsewhere, silver fell 0.5 percent to $14.98 per ounce, while platinum slipped 0.5 percent to $890.37. Palladium was also down 0.5 percent at $1,457, having climbed to its highest in a month at $1,466.42 earlier in the session.

971,GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares turn flat as sentiment wanes - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:58 AM / 8 days ago","5 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * U.S. GDP, China industrial profits data help stocks * MSCI ACWI flat * Italian bonds rally after S&P affirms rating * Spain’s IBEX falls over half a percent after elections LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Global shares were steady on Monday as a weak euro zone sentiment survey and political uncertainty in the wake of Spain’s elections proved a drag on earlier gains driven by strong economic data out of China and the United States. The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was flat in early afternoon trade in London, giving up earlier gains of as much as 0.06 percent. U.S. stock futures pointed to a subdued open on Wall Street. European shares, which had firmed at the open, were hit by uncertainty related to the formation of a government in Spain and weak euro zone economic sentiment data that exacerbated fears over slowing global growth. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 index underperformed peers, falling as much as 0.8 percent, and Spanish government bond yields dipped after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez overcame a challenge from right-wing nationalists in elections on Sunday. Shares in Italian banks got a boost and Italian government bonds rallied after S&P Global affirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating. Still nagged by uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, investors were looking to a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve this week and Chinese factory data for further clues on policy direction in the world’s biggest economies. “For stock traders, it seems that the important catalysts are pointing higher: the U.S. sees strong domestic growth, low inflation keeps the Fed at bay and could potentially trigger a rate cut so it seems that equities have nowhere to go but higher - at least in the short term,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS. Chinese blue-chips rose over 1 percent after losing 5.6 percent last week, leading Shanghai shares to an intraday high in afternoon trade. In China, fresh data showed industrial profits grew in March after four months of contraction, but analysts said sentiment remained fragile. Economists polled by Reuters expect factory activity in the world’s second largest economy to grow at a steady but modest pace in April. In contrast with weakness in Asian markets last week, Wall Street ended Friday on a high note, propelled by GDP figures. Australian shares were down 0.4 percent after hitting an 11-year closing high on Friday, while Seoul’s KOSPI was up 1.4 percent. Japan’s financial markets are closed for a long national holiday this week, but the Nikkei 225 futures index in Singapore was 0.9 percent higher. U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annualised rate in the first quarter, although some analysts sounded a cautious note. “The details (of the GDP release), however, were distinctly less impressive with underlying domestic demand growing only 1.3 percent, the slowest rate since 2015,” said Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood. “Given this mixed picture, this coming week’s spate of U.S. data releases will be of heightened importance for markets.” The March reading for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s favoured inflation measure, is due later on Monday. The central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell expected to balance the strong domestic growth data against persistent concerns over the global outlook. Markets will also be looking to global factory activity surveys this week, particularly official and private readings on Chinese manufacturing which will both be released on Tuesday. Currency markets were calm. The dollar was 0.2 percent higher against the yen at 111.74, and the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1162. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was nearly flat at 98.039. Oil prices fell, extending a slump from Friday that ended weeks of rallying, after President Donald Trump demanded that producer club OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Brent crude fell half a percent to $71.81 per barrel. Spot gold fell 0.4 percent, trading at $1,280.62 per ounce. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho, additional reporting by Andrew

In yet another busy week for earnings, about 160 S&P 500 companies, including Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc, are due to report their quarterly reports. Analysts now expect profits of S&P 500 companies to fall 0.3%, a sharp improvement from a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of the month, according to Refinitiv data. An inflation report from the Commerce Department is expected to show personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for March to have risen 0.7% from 0.1% in February. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The core PCE index, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, is expected to remain steady at 0.1% in March. Also weighing on sentiment was data from the Euro Zone that showed economic sentiment dipped for the 10th consecutive month to its lowest level in more than two years in April. As trade talks enter their last leg, U.S. negotiators head to China on Tuesday to try to hammer out details to end the protracted trade spat between the two countries.

973,UPDATE 1-Clean Russian oil yet to reach Belarus via major pipeline to Europe - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:45 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read* Belarus refineries running at reduced capacity * Refinery supplies as far west as Germany affected * Moscow says two-weeks needed to fix issue across network By Andrei Makhovsky and Gleb Gorodyankin MINSK/MOSCOW, April 29 (Reuters) - Belarus said on Monday that clean Russian oil had yet to reach its borders via a major pipeline supplying Europe after tainted crude running through the system prompted several importers to halt flows last week. State-run oil firm Belneftekhim said Belarusian refineries were still running at reduced capacity, after Moscow had said it would start pumping clean crude from Monday through the Druzhba network that supplies refineries as far west as Germany. Moscow had also said on Friday it would take two weeks to stabilise oil supplies across the Druzhba network, which has northern and southern pipeline spurs. Poland, Germany, Ukraine, Slovakia and other countries on the network suspended imports via the pipeline after finding contaminants in the crude that can damage refinery equipment. A source with a buyer at the northern Druzhba leg said on Monday that supplies via Adamova Zastava to Poland and Germany were still halted and not expected to resume in the short term. Belneftekhim said it was holding talks at Russia’s Energy Ministry with Russian oil firms on the matter. The problem arose when an unidentified Russian producer contaminated oil with high levels of organic chloride, which is typically used to boost oil output but which must be separated before shipment to avoid damaging refining processing units. Russia has not offered specifics about how it planned to clean out contaminated oil from the whole network. Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin told reporters in Minsk after Friday’s talks that one option to resolve the problem was to mix clean oil with the contaminated crude. Another option to supply refineries reliant on the pipeline would be to transport clean oil by rail tankers, traders said. Some refineries have turned to supplies via other pipelines, but analysts say those alternative routes have limited capacity. Czech oil refiner Unipetrol has asked the government to lend it crude from state reserves to use, with amounts to be discussed at a meeting on Monday. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft is investigating the issue, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday, adding that this could lead to a wider inquiry, possibly including law enforcement agencies. The pipeline issue has cut off a major supply route for Polish refineries owned by Poland’s PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos, as well as plants in Germany owned by Total , Shell, Eni and Rosneft.

974,U.S. judge gives Trump ex-aide Manafort leniency: under four years in prison - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  11:02 AM / 2 months ago","8 Min ReadALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was sentenced on Thursday by a U.S. judge to less than four years in prison - far shy of federal sentencing guidelines - for financial crimes uncovered during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis imposed the surprisingly lenient 47-month sentence on Manafort, 69, during a hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, in which the veteran Republican political consultant asked for mercy but expressed no remorse for his actions.  Manafort was convicted by a jury last August of five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud and one count of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. Ellis disregarded federal sentencing guidelines cited by prosecutors that called for 19-1/2 to 24 years in prison. The judge ordered Manafort to pay a fine of $50,000 and restitution of just over $24 million. Manafort, brought into the courtroom in a wheelchair because of a condition called gout, listened during the hearing as Ellis extolled his “otherwise blameless” life in which he “earned the admiration of a number of people” and engaged in “a lot of good things.” “Clearly the guidelines were way out of whack on this,” Ellis said. Manafort was convicted after prosecutors accused him of hiding from the U.S. government millions of dollars he earned as a consultant for Ukraine’s former pro-Russia government. After pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s ouster, prosecutors said, Manafort lied to banks to secure loans and maintain an opulent lifestyle with luxurious homes, designer suits and even a $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket. The judge also said Manafort “is not before the court for any allegations that he, or anyone at his direction, colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election.” The sentence was even less than the sentence recommended by Manafort’s lawyers of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 years in prison. “These are serious crimes, we understand that,” said Thomas Zehnle, one of Manafort’s lawyers. “Tax evasion is by no means jaywalking. But it’s not narcotics trafficking.” Legal experts expressed surprise over the sentence. “This is a tremendous defeat for the special counsel’s office,” former federal prosecutor David Weinstein said. Manafort’s sentence was less than half of what people who plead guilty and cooperate with the government typically get in similar cases, according to Mark Allenbaugh, a former attorney with the U.S. Sentencing Commission. “Very shocking,” he said. Ellis, appointed to the bench by Republican former President Ronald Reagan, called the sentence “sufficiently punitive,” and noted that Manafort’s time already served would be subtracted from the 47 months. Manafort has been jailed since June 2018. Manafort’s legal troubles are not over. He faces sentencing next Wednesday in Washington in a separate case for two conspiracy charges involving lobbying and money laundering to which he pleaded guilty last September. Legal experts said the light sentence from Ellis could prompt U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to impose a sentence closer to the maximum of 10 years in the Washington case, and order that the sentence run after the current one is completed rather than concurrently. Jackson was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama. Before the sentencing, Manafort expressed no remorse but talked about how the case had been difficult for him and his family. Manafort, who opted not to testify during his trial, told Ellis that “to say I have been humiliated and ashamed would be a gross understatement.” He described his life as “professionally and financially in shambles.” The judge told Manafort: “I was surprised I did not hear you express regret for engaging in wrongful conduct.” Manafort, with noticeably grayer hair than just months ago, came into the courtroom in a wheelchair holding a cane, wearing a green prison jumpsuit emblazoned with the words “Alexandria Inmate” on the back. It was a far cry from Manafort’s usual dapper appearance and stylish garb. During a break shortly before the sentence was handed down, Manafort turned around and blew his wife, Kathleen, a kiss. The case capped a stunning downfall for Manafort, a prominent figure in Republican Party circles for decades who also worked as a consultant to such international figures as former Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and Yanukovych. Ellis had faced criticism by some in the legal community for comments he made during the trial that were widely interpreted as biased against the prosecution. Ellis repeatedly interrupted prosecutors, told them to stop using the word “oligarch” to describe people associated with Manafort because it made him seem “despicable,” and objected to pictures of Manafort’s luxury items they planned to show jurors. “It isn’t a crime to have a lot of money and be profligate in your spending,” Ellis told prosecutors during the trial. Prosecutor Greg Andres urged Ellis to impose a steep sentence. “This case must stand as a beacon to others that this conduct cannot be accepted,” Andres told the hearing on Thursday. Jackson ruled on Feb. 13 that Manafort had breached his agreement to cooperate with Mueller’s office by lying to prosecutors about three matters pertinent to the Russia probe including his interactions with a business partner they have said has ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort is the only one of the 34 people and three companies charged by Mueller to have gone to trial. Several others including former campaign aides Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen have pleaded guilty, while longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone has pleaded not guilty. Trump, a Republican who has called Mueller’s investigation a politically motivated “witch hunt,” has not ruled out giving Manafort a presidential pardon, saying in November: “I wouldn’t take it off the table.”  “There’s absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved with any collusion with any government official from Russia,” Kevin Downing, another Manafort lawyer, said outside the courthouse. The Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, quickly accused Downing of making “a deliberate appeal for a pardon” from Trump. Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said after the sentencing:     “I believe Manafort has been disproportionately harassed and hopefully soon there will be an investigation of the overzealous prosecutorial intimidation so it doesn’t happen again.” Mueller is preparing to submit to U.S. Attorney General William Barr a report on his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction and Russia has denied U.S. intelligence findings that it interfered in the 2016 election in an effort to boost Trump. Manafort worked for Trump’s campaign for five pivotal months in 2016 that included the Republican National Convention where Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination, three of them as campaign chairman.

975,"Trump says ex-lawyer Cohen asked him for a pardon, but he declined - Reuters","March 8, 2019 /  4:25 PM / in 2 months","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who has since turned against him and pleaded guilty to multiple crimes, had asked him directly for a pardon but was rejected. “Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied!,” Trump tweeted. “Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO.” Cohen responded by calling Trump’s assertions lies. “Just another set of lies by @POTUS @realdonaldtrump,” he wrote in a tweet. Cohen is due to begin serving a three-year prison sentence on May 6 for lying to Congress last year about efforts to build a Trump tower in Moscow, along with other charges. Trump in December called Cohen a “rat” for cooperating with prosecutors and has said he should go to prison. In public testimony last week before a House of Representatives panel, Cohen called Trump, his employer for more than 10 years, a “racist,” “conman” and “cheat.” Cohen has said he worked on the Moscow project for nearly a year while Trump was running for president, and acted at Trump’s direction to break campaign-finance laws by arranging “hush money” payments to women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump.

976,"House passes Democrats' campaign finance, ethics bill - Reuters","March 8, 2019 /  5:26 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday passed legislation that Democrats say will lessen the influence of big-money interests in federal elections, make voting easier and tackle “gerrymandering” that skews the makeup of congressional districts to favor particular political parties. In a warning shot to Republican President Donald Trump, Democrats included a provision in the bill requiring all presidents and presidential nominees to make public their tax filings - something the current White House resident has steadfastly refused to do. Some congressional investigators think those returns could shed light on whether Trump has had any business dealings in Russia that could have influenced his relations with Moscow, either as a presidential candidate or as president. In a party-line vote of 234-193, the House approved the “For the People Act,” a bill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised in the 2018 congressional election campaigns that Democrats would pursue to help clean up American politics and foster voting rights. Shortly before passage of the bill, Pelosi said it “ends the dominance of big, dark, special-interest money in politics and it empowers small donors and the grassroots” and “fights voter suppression.” But the measure is likely to become merely a campaign tool for Democrats as they try to expand the number of seats they hold in the House and to capture the Senate and White House in the 2020 elections. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has repeatedly attacked the Democratic bill, leaving little chance for it in the Republican-controlled Senate. Backers say the legislation would make voter registration easier, expand voting hours on election days, restore voting rights to U.S. citizens who have served prison sentences for felonies and shore up voting machines and election infrastructure against cyber attacks and other interference. The legislation comes after U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russia meddled in the 2016 American presidential elections and as Moscow has been accused of trying to influence the outcome of elections in other democracies. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election. Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has been investigating whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in a way that was beneficial to his successful 2016 White House bid. Trump has denied there was any collusion between his campaign and Moscow, and has labeled Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt.” The House bill would require states to establish independent commissions for drawing congressional districts, instead of the  power residing mainly in the hands of state governors and legislatures. Tougher ethics standards would be imposed on members of Congress, and small campaign donations would be matched with federal funds to try to blunt the influence of big donors.  Calling it the “Democrat Politician Protection Act,” McConnell has lambasted the legislation, arguing it would give Washington too much control over elections while unnecessarily using tax dollars for political campaigns. As Senate majority leader, McConnell has the power to largely decide what legislation is debated in the upper chamber.

Putin has already signed an order to simplify the procedure for obtaining a Russian passport for residents of separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine, prompting calls from Kiev for more international sanctions. Ukrainian President-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Putin should not expect many Ukrainians to take up his offer of a Russian passport, while offering Ukrainian citizenship to Russians.

981,What happens next as Spain's Socialists try to form government - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  11:01 AM / in 8 days","3 Min ReadMADRID, April 29 (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Socialists won a national election on Sunday but failed to gain a parliamentary majority. Sanchez will now seek partners to form a new government. Here are the likely next steps: Sanchez will approach other parties in an attempt to find common ground to form a government. The talks could last weeeks if not months. The first session of the lower chamber is scheduled for May 21. After that, King Felipe will consult with party leaders to find a prime ministerial candidate who the lower chamber will support. A new government needs an absolute majority in a first round parliamentary vote to take office. In a second round vote only a simple majority is necessary. If the candidate fails to pass these votes, the clock starts ticking on a two-month deadline for deputies to choose a new prime minister before parliament is automatically dissolved, and another election scheduled to take place 54 days later. Most analysts believe the most likely result is a coalition government of the Socialists and leftist Podemos, although they would not have a majority. At the last count, the Socialists had won 123 seats in parliament and Podemos 42. That leaves them 11 seats short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament and means they would still rely on smaller parties, most likely Basque nationalists or Catalan separatists, to go ahead. The picture could still change slightly as the election count is finalised in the first weeks of May. If talks between the Socialists and Podemos fail, Sanchez could contact centre-right Ciudadanos, which became Spain’s third-biggest party after Sunday’s vote with 57 seats in parliament. The two parties would have a majority and many in the financial markets see this as the preferred option. So far neither party has backed this option. Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera has told supporters his party would lead the parliamentary opposition to Sanchez while Socialist backers chanted “with Rivera, no!” at a post-election rally on Sunday. Alternatively, senior members of Sanchez’s government have suggested they could continue to govern with a minority of seats, as they have since taking office last June. After discussions with the parties, King Felipe faces no specific deadline to propose a candidate. There are regional and local elections on May 26 - the same day as European parliament elections - which will delay talks to form a governmen. That means a new government is unlikely to be ready until June or July. Reporting By Axel Bugge and Isla Binnie; Editing by Angus

986,FOREX-Dollar rally stalls underlining slowdown fears - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  9:21 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read* Major currencies hold to tight ranges * Investors await Fed meeting, U.S. inflation and jobs data * Japan closed all week, China closed Wednesday-Friday * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds context, quote) By Tom Finn and Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - A rally in the dollar faltered on Monday with strong U.S. data doing little to lift the currency or convince investors that a slowdown in activity is over. The greenback traded in a narrow range as Japan kicked off a week of holidays, typically a period of thin liquidity that can prompt spikes in volatility. A Federal Reserve policy meeting, Brexit negotiations and a raft of global data including on U.S. core inflation and payrolls could each be the trigger for big currency swings this week. All eyes are on the Fed to see what its policymakers made of a first-quarter gross domestic product report that showed strong growth of 3.2 percent, but largely for one-off reasons including a surge in inventories. “This is not the week during which we would be looking to put on large positions in FX in an attempt to profit from the market implications of one or more economic events,” said Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in London. “Nevertheless, our overwhelming bias with high conviction remains buying the USD on dips vs most of the rest of the G10 space.” The aggregate dollar long position climbed to $33.6 billion on Monday, its highest level since December 2015, according to Scotiabank’s weekly CFTC sentiment report. The euro remains the largest held net short. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction softer at 97.970, having eased from a near two-year peak of 98.330. The dollar fell back on Friday despite the upbeat GDP report because core inflation slowed sharply, leading speculators to narrow the odds on a rate cut this year. Most other major central banks have also turned dovish in recent months, keeping their currencies subdued. The Canadian dollar and Swedish crown, for instance, both took hits last week when their central banks put a halt on future rate hikes. The European Central Bank is under pressure to keep its stimulus in place, if not to do a new round, while markets are pricing in rate cuts for Australia and New Zealand following weak inflation readings. Some fear the lack of liquidity could lead to a re-run of the dollar’s flash crash from January when the yen made massive gains in a matter of minutes as bears were forced to cover short positions. The euro was a shade firmer at $1.1157, but still not far from a near two-year trough of $1.1110. The euro has been broadly pushing lower since early January. A swathe of manufacturing surveys from Europe and China are due later this week, along with a first reading on EU GDP. The U.S. payrolls report on Friday is forecast to show a solid increase of 180,000 in April, with unemployment at 3.8 percent. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney, Editing by Peter

987,Debate over anti-Semitism charges exposes divide in Democratic Party - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  9:40 PM / 2 months ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a broad resolution condemning bigotry on Thursday after remarks by a Democratic member that some viewed as anti-Semitic exposed an ideological and generational rift in the party. Some Democrats, including several U.S. senators who are seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination, warned that party leaders were playing into Republicans’ hands and had stymied legitimate debate over U.S.-Israel policy. The House, which is controlled by Democrats, approved the resolution condemning anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim discrimination and other forms of bigotry by a 407-to-23 vote. The vote came less than a week after Representative Ilhan Omar, one of the two first Muslim women elected to Congress, made statements at a Washington event that were denounced by some as anti-Semitic.  The resolution does not mention Omar by name. But Republicans have seized on Omar’s statements and the resulting intra-party conflict as a sign the Democratic Party is fractured. Many Democrats, in turn, have said House leaders were cowed by a Republican effort to divert attention from bigotry within their own ranks and that Omar is being held to a different standard.  “Unfortunately, I think the Democratic leadership here has made what I think is a pretty serious mistake in caving to this pressure,” said Democratic strategist Peter Daou, who has advised Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. The disagreement began after Omar, in an appearance at a Washington book store, said she feared that statements she and fellow Representative Rashida Tlaib made about foreign policy and the pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) would be viewed as anti-Semitic because they are Muslim. “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it’s OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA (National Rifle Association), of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies?” Omar said. Omar’s critics denounced the statement as playing into the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish Americans are loyal to Israel over the United States. Omar said opposing the policies of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not synonymous with anti-Semitism. Omar, in a joint statement issued after Thursday’s vote with Tlaib and Representative Andre Carson, a Democrat from Indiana, said “we are tremendously proud to be part of a body that has put forth a condemnation of all forms of bigotry.” Omar had previously apologized for February tweets that her critics said suggested Jewish Americans used money to influence pro-Israel U.S. policies. Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, told reporters on Wednesday that Omar “embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry.”  President Donald Trump on Twitter on Wednesday called the Democratic response “shameful.”  Cheney, complaining that the House should have “rebuked” Omar by name and removed her from the Foreign Affairs Committee, voted against the resolution. Other Republicans who voted no, such as Chris Collins of New York, said the bill was not “strong enough in support of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East.” Republican Representative Steve King, who was condemned by the House in January for questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive, voted present.   Democrats had been divided over how best to handle Omar’s comments. Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he welcomes policy debate but that it was “deeply offensive to call into question the loyalty of fellow American citizens because of their political views, including the U.S.-Israel relationship.” Young, progressive House newcomers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and several Democratic presidential candidates, however, came to Omar’s defense. Senator Bernie Sanders said in a statement that “we must not ... equate anti-Semitism with legitimate criticism of the right-wing, Netanyahu government.” Senator Elizabeth Warren said “branding criticism of Israel as automatically anti-Semitic has a chilling effect on our public discourse.” Senator Kamala Harris said she was concerned about Omar’s safety.  Daou, the Democratic strategist, said a political double standard was at play, pointing to a recent tweet from Republican Representative Jim Jordan that used a dollar sign for a letter in the name of Democratic donor Tom Steyer, who is Jewish. “Why is it that a white, male Republican can largely get away with the same thing and this massive outcry happened over a Muslim, progressive woman of color? That’s something we have to grapple with,” Daou said.

988,House Republican lays into Democrats' corruption probe of Trump - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  8:10 PM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Republican on a U.S. House of Representatives oversight committee that is investigating President Donald Trump blasted the Democratic-led probe on Thursday as a “draconian inquisition” and an abuse of congressional power. The House Judiciary Committee’s ranking Republican, Doug Collins, said the panel’s investigation into obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power under Trump surpasses the scope of legitimate legislative inquiry and violates the U.S. Constitution. Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler launched the investigation on Monday by sending document requests to 81 government agencies, business entities and individuals associated with Trump, including his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. “Your requests are part of a concerted effort to target and punish associates of the president,” Collins wrote to Nadler in a March 7 letter released by the Republican’s office. “This effort to intimidate those who choose to associate with the president ‘through actual or threatened imposition of government power or sanction’ violates the First Amendment.”  Nadler’s office was not immediately available to comment on the letter, which cited several court cases as legal precedents for limiting the scope of congressional investigations.  Democrats, who won control of the House last year in an election marked by voter opposition to Trump, say they must investigate the Republican president to uphold the rule of law after two years of inactivity under the previous Republican majority. The committee is seeking evidence of misconduct by Trump, including any effort to obstruct U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian election meddling during the 1996 presidential election and any collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, and other federal investigations.  But Collins, a Georgia Republican, said Democrats could instead upend the rule of law: “Your 81 letters appear to be little more than a deep-sea fishing expedition with the purpose of exposing private matters and airing alleged dirty laundry rather than legislating.”  While some Democrats want to impeach Trump, Nadler and other House Democratic committee chairmen say they are far from any such decision.   But without impeachment proceedings providing a legislative purpose, Collins said the House Judiciary probe threatens to usurp the law enforcement powers granted to the executive and judicial branches of government by the Constitution, while burdening innocent individuals with unnecessary legal costs. “It is my hope that your draconian inquisitions are not returning this committee to the dark days of 16th-century England,” he said. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow, and has labeled the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.” Reporting by David Morgan; editing by Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

990,"EMERGING MARKETS-Stocks, FX gain as China data boost sentiment - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  9:16 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read* MSCI’s EM equities index up 0.5 pct * Chinese blue chips supported by industrial profit data * Czech stocks see worst day since June 2016 on possible bank tax * Currencies advance against dollar By Aaron Saldanha April 29 (Reuters) - Emerging-market stocks rose on Monday after China reported profits at industrial companies grew for the first time in four months. Developing-world currencies advanced against a weaker U.S. dollar. The Chinese data was supplemented by data on Friday that showed first-quarter U.S. economic growth was driven by temporary factors, making it less likely to lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon. “I do believe these are some positive signs from China and we in Europe are hoping we can see some spill-overs,” said Morten Lund, an analyst at Nordea Markets. MSCI’s index of developing-world equities was up 0.5 percent, its best one-day showing in nearly two weeks, as stocks rose in China and South Korea. Chinese blue-chip stocks gained 0.3 percent from Friday’s three-and-a-half-week low. The 1.7 percent rise by South Korea equities was their largest since Jan. 9. Russia’s rouble gained 0.2 percent and Russian equities added 0.4 percent, mainly on gains by financials and energy stocks. Shares of Safmar Financial Investments led the gains, rising 1.9 percent. Safmar bought a controlling stake in the Afipsky refinery, Kommersant reported. Gazprom shares gained 1.3 percent after it reported 2018 profit doubled on record-high sales to Europe. Turkey’s lira fell 0.1 percent. The local stocks index slid 0.3 percent. Turkish banks fell 1.8 percent and were headed for their lowest closing level in a month. A report said banks would start raising lira deposit rates this week, a move that would most likely trim their profitability but could support the currency. “If you look at the Turkish banks at least before the August (2018) crisis, they were or are well capitalised ... but when your currency depreciates so much and interest rates spike, you have got to be concerned,” said Nordea’s Lund. South Africa’s rand was up 0.4 percent, gaining for a third straight session. South African stocks marked time. In emerging Europe, Czech stocks fell 2.5 percent, set for their worst day since late June 2016, after the prime minister said the government would debate introducing taxes on banks, insurers and mobile operators.

991,Investors call for reprieve for Bayer bosses after AGM rebuke - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:32 AM / 8 days ago","4 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Three of Bayer’s largest German investors said the drugmaker’s embattled management needed to stay at the helm to avoid further upheaval, despite their unease over a share price slump in the wake of the $63 billion Monsanto takeover. The backing for Chief Executive Werner Baumann comes after an unprecedented rebuke at the annual shareholder meeting on Friday, where a majority of investors cast a vote of disapproval of top management’s actions. “A hasty replacement of the CEO would only increase the risk of a break-up and therefore can’t be in the interest of long-term oriented investors such as Union Investment,” said Janne Werning, an analyst at Germany’s Union Investment which is a top-20 shareholder. “The scale of the litigation risks won’t become clearer before next year, that’s why we think it’s fair and necessary to grant top management more time,” he said in a written statement over the weekend. DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank, said on Monday it currently also saw no merits in ousting Bayer’s top managers. Union had been among top-20 investors who cast a ‘No’ vote in Bayer’s annual AGM poll to ratify management’s business conduct during the year under review, saying the legal risks associated with Monsanto had been known for many years. About 30 billion euros ($33 billion) have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. More than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. Bayer shares were 2.3 percent lower by 0910 GMT on Monday, as the stock traded without the right to a 2.80 euro per-share dividend for the first time. Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the Roundup verdicts and has pointed to global regulators’ findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, is safe. Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Deka Investment, said on Friday that management change would only compound the chaos. “It can’t be in anyone’s interest to see the daily operations being neglected, on top of all the existing chaos,” he said at the AGM. In a cautionary reminder of the risks of management turmoil, shares in German engineering group Thyssenkrupp continued to slide after both the CEO and chairman quit last year amid calls from activist investors to change strategy. Markus Mayer, an analyst at brokerage Baader Helvea stressed the potential benefits of a management shake-up. “Activist investors or strategic buyers ...might replace the supervisory board and management and split up and/or take over parts of Bayer. As we see significant valuation upside for Bayer,” he said on Monday.  Over the weekend, Bayer’s management was at pains to reassure staff over any fallout from the AGM vote, saying it was the backing from the non-executive board that counted.    “The stockholder vote will generate press attention and speculation about Bayer’s leadership. You will likely read about it in the media or face questions from friends and family,” Bayer’s executive board told employees in a letter seen by Reuters. It said the vote had no legal consequences. “The Supervisory Board’s vote of confidence in us as the Board of Management gives us a clear mandate to lead our company,” managers went on to say. Bayer’s non-executive supervisory board won 66.4 percent of the votes ratifying its business conduct at the AGM. Though a majority, the result came in far below a nod of 95 percent or more that is the norm at German AGMs.     Additional reporting by Patricia Weiss; Editing by Keith WeirAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

992,"Spain's Socialists, short of majority, weigh partners for forming government - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  9:13 AM / 8 days ago","4 Min ReadMADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s ruling Socialists were considering possible partners for a new government for the politically polarized country on Monday after they won a national election but failed to secure a majority. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez faces a choice between a complex alliance with fellow leftists Podemos or joining forces across the political divide with the center-right Ciudadanos. The Socialists won 123 seats in Sunday’s election, up from 84 in the outgoing parliament as they saw off the challenge from the right, which was splintered by the rise of the far-right Vox. With nearly all the votes counted, the Socialists together with the far-left Podemos were 11 seats short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament.  That could mean Sanchez having to rely on pro-independence Catalan parties or Basque nationalists to govern. “A Socialist-led government with support from Podemos seems the most likely outcome,” rating agency DBRS said in a report. “This political combination needs the parliamentary support from smaller parties.” Podemos leader Pablo Iglesais said on Sunday his party would happily enter a coalition with the Socialists, but Sanchez has yet to comment. Another possibility that Sanchez has not ruled out is an  alliance with Ciudadanos. The two parties would have enough seats to govern without other partners - an alliance favored by many in the business and financial world. However, a Socialist-Ciudadanos deal appeared unlikely on Monday.  Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera told supporters on Sunday night his party would lead the parliamentary opposition to Sanchez. Ines Arrimadas, head of Ciudadanos in Catalonia, added on Monday: “Everyone who voted for Ciudadanos did so knowing that we would not ally with Sanchez.” Either way, negotiations on forming a government could take weeks or even months.  Under Spanish electoral law, a new government requires an absolute majority in parliament to take office in a first round of voting. To do that in combination with Podemos, the Socialists would require the support of at least one lawmaker from the Catalan separatist camp.  The region’s independence drive was the most divisive issue in an election dominated by a sometimes fraught debate over national identity. In cutting a deal with the separatists, Sanchez risks stepping into a political minefield. In any second round of voting, Sanchez would need only a simple majority to get his government voted in, which the Socialists and Podemos could do with backing of all regional parties except the Catalans, plus one abstention. The picture could still change when the election count is finalised in coming weeks. Still, the left clearly won Spain’s third national election in four years as the mainstream conservative Popular Party (PP) lost votes to Vox, which benefited from anti-immigration sentiment and concerns over Catalan separatism.  Vox became the first far-right party in Spain to have a major representation in parliament since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The PP had its worst election since the early 1980s, winning just 66 seats - less that half of its total in the outgoing parliament. The PP, together with Ciudadanos and Vox combined only won 147 seats. Sanchez called the election after failing to win support in parliament early this year for his 2019 budget. Ciudadanos got 57 seats on Sunday, Podemos 42 and Vox 24.

993,"PRECIOUS-Gold falls as U.S., China data boost equities - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  4:40 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min Read* SPDR gold holdings at lowest since Oct. 19 * Palladium off one-month peak (Updates prices, adds comments) By Arijit Bose April 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices eased on Monday, having touched a more-than one week high in the previous session, as stronger equity markets lifted risk-sentiment, thereby eroding safe-haven demand of the metal. Spot gold fell by 0.3 percent to $1,281.87 per ounce at 0847 GMT, having hit its highest since April 16 at $1,288.59 in the previous session. U.S. gold futures shed 0.4 percent to $1,283.80 an ounce. “There have been rebounds in both U.S. and Chinese data. This is beating the safe-haven demand and helping the equity markets instead,” said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of commodity research at SMC Comtrade. Global shares rose on Monday, aided by data showing profits at Chinese industrial firms grew for the first time in four months and a strong reading of U.S. first quarter growth data last week. Chinese industrial firms rose 13.9 percent year-on-year in March, thereby furthering optimism that the country’s economy may be starting to stabilize. Friday’s gross domestic product (GDP) data from the United States also saw the country’s economy grow by 3.2 percent in the first quarter. The recent uplift in equities has kept gold under the wraps with holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, falling 0.16 percent to its lowest since Oct. 19 at 746.69 tonnes on Friday. Holdings have fallen by over 3 percent since the beginning of this month. However, the U.S. GDP data also instigated questions about the actual economic strength of the country, since the quarterly growth figures were largely driven by temporary factors like a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015. Data showed that core personal consumption expenditure price index figure, the Fed’s preferred metric of inflation, increased at only a 1.3 percent rate versus 1.8 percent in the prior quarter. “The U.S. GDP figures, also cast some doubt on the state of its economy and the strength of the U.S. consumer,” said IG Markets analyst Kyle Rodda, said adding that has prompted some traders to expect a rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve. About a third of economists polled by Reuters on April 25 expect one real rate cut by 2020. Lower interest rates in the U.S. put pressure on the dollar and bond yields, making greenback-denominated gold less expensive for holders of other currencies and increasing the appeal of non-yielding assets. Elsewhere, silver fell 0.6 percent to $14.97 per ounce, while platinum gained 0.1 percent to $895.25. Palladium fell 0.4 percent to $1,458.50, having climbed to its highest in a month at $1,466.42 earlier in the session.

April 29 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi’s stock index fell on Monday, pulled down by its financial shares, particularly First Abu Dhabi Bank. Most major Gulf markets fell. The Abu Dhabi index lost 1 percent, with First Abu Dhabi Bank shedding 1.5 percent before reporting its first-quarter results later in the day. Dana Gas slid 2.1 percent to fall for the third straight session. The company’s stock went ex-dividend on Thursday and has been sliding since. Saudi Arabia’s main index was the only market to gain in early trading, inching up 0.1 percent.

995,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Global shares advance on data boost from U.S., China - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  8:37 AM / 8 days ago","5 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * U.S. GDP, China industrial profits data help stocks * MSCI ACWI up 0.06 percent * Italian bonds rally after S&P affirms rating * Spain’s IBEX falls over half a percent after elections * Dollar dips By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - Global shares rose on Monday, aided by data showing profits at Chinese industrial firms grew for the first time in four months and a strong reading of U.S. first quarter growth data last week. The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.06 percent after the start of European trading. Most major European stock markets traded firmer, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.1 percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 index underperformed peers, however, down over half a percent after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez overcame a challenge from right-wing nationalists in elections on Sunday. The elections had little immediate impact on the country’s bond market. Shares in Italian banks got a boost and Italian government bonds rallied after S&P Global affirmed Italy’s sovereign credit rating. Still nagged by uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, investors were looking to a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve this week and Chinese factory data for further clues on policy direction in the world’s biggest economies. “For stock traders, it seems that the important catalysts are pointing higher: the U.S. sees strong domestic growth, low inflation keeps the Fed at bay and could potentially trigger a rate cut so it seems that equities have nowhere to go but higher - at least in the short term,” said Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS. Chinese blue-chips rose over 1 percent after losing 5.6 percent last week, leading Shanghai shares .SSEC to an intraday high in afternoon trade. Australian shares were down 0.4 percent after hitting an 11-year closing high on Friday, while Seoul’s KOSPI was up 1.4 percent. Japan’s financial markets are closed for a long national holiday this week, but Nikkei 225 futures index in Singapore was 0.9 percent higher. Monday’s gains follow data showing U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 3.2 percent annualised rate in the first quarter. Nomura FX strategist Jordan Rochester noted last week’s U.S. GDP was driven by a surge in inventories, government spending, and a big contribution from net trade. “None of those are likely to be sustained, hence why market reaction was limited,” he said in a note to clients. “But overall, the past week has been dominated by higher U.S. equity prices and consequently a U.S. dollar outperformance story. In our view, this week should see a test of that new trend,” he said, referencing upcoming economic data this week. In China, fresh data showed industrial profits grew in March after four months of contraction, but analysts said sentiment remained fragile. Economists polled by Reuters expect factory activity in the world’s second largest economy to grow at a steady but modest pace in April. In contrast with weakness in Asian markets last week, Wall Street ended Friday on a high note, propelled by the GDP figures. The March reading for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s favoured inflation measure, is due later on Monday. The central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell expected to balance the strong domestic growth data against persistent concerns over the global outlook. Markets will also be looking to global factory activity surveys this week, particularly official and private readings on Chinese manufacturing which will both be released on Tuesday. With Japan on an extended break, currency markets were calm ahead of the FOMC meeting and U.S. jobs numbers. The dollar was 0.2 percent higher against the yen at 111.74, and the euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1162. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, slipped 0.03 percent to 97.985. Oil prices fell, extending a slump from Friday that ended weeks of rallying, after President Donald Trump demanded that producer club OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran.

996,FAB weighs on Abu Dhabi stocks; most major Gulf markets down - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  8:30 AM / in 8 days","2 Min ReadApril 29 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi’s stock index fell on Monday, pulled down by its financial shares, particularly First Abu Dhabi Bank. Most major Gulf markets fell. The Abu Dhabi index lost 1 percent, with First Abu Dhabi Bank shedding 1.5 percent before reporting its first-quarter results later in the day. Dana Gas slid 2.1 percent to fall for the third straight session. The company’s stock went ex-dividend on Thursday and has been sliding since. Saudi Arabia’s main index was the only market to gain in early trading, inching up 0.1 percent. Saudi British Bank rose 2.6 percent to its highest in four years after reporting a 24 percent increase in first-quarter net profit. Zahrat Al Waha gained 1.5 percent after posting a two-fold rise in its first-quarter net profit. Dubai’s index slipped 0.2 percent for its fifth straight day of loss, partly due to a 4.3 percent decline by Dubai Islamic Insurance And Reinsurance after its shareholders elected against a dividend distribution for 2018. Islamic Arab Insurance Co also fell 1.6 percent after its shareholders decided against a dividend distribution for the year. Qatar’s blue-chip index was down 0.1 percent.

997,IMF urges economic stability during Algeria's political transition - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  8:27 AM / 8 days ago","3 Min ReadDUBAI (Reuters) - Algeria needs to focus on avoiding economic instability during its political transition after the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a senior official at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. Jihad Azour, IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia director, also told Reuters the OPEC member should carry out reforms to help cut deficit and reduce reliance on oil and gas. Bouteflika resigned on April 2 amid mass demonstrations against his two decade rule, and the protests have not stopped, with activists seeking the departure of Prime Minister Nouredibe Bedoui and interim president Abdelkader Bensalah. Bensalah is in charge of a 90-day transition period set to end with a presidential election on July 4. Algeria has been under financial pressure due to a fall in global oil prices since mid-2014. It has failed to diversify the economy away from crude and gas which account for 60 percent of the budget and 94 percent of total exports. “Structural reforms will allow Algeria to diversify outside oil and to use its strengths, both in terms of a young population, geographical location and wealth it has in different sectors,” Azour said. Algeria’s economy grew 2.3 percent in 2018 due to higher oil prices, up from 1.4 percent the previous year, but below a 4 percent government forecast, according to the finance ministry. The non-energy sector grew 4 percent last year, against 2.2 percent in 2017. The government last year started implementing changes that allow the central bank to lend directly to the treasury to fund internal public debt. The budget deficit is projected at 9.2 percent of gross domestic product for this year, up from 9 percent in 2018. “What is important economically for Algeria is to preserve economic stability during this political transition,” Azour said. There will also be a need to “anchor stability in the medium term by reducing gradually the level of the budget deficit and avoiding any monetizing of the deficit,” he added.

Markets do not expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates this week. Rates now are not expected to rise until early 2020. “The general weakness in the dollar is contributing to the pound’s strength and the moves may be exaggerated in a thin market,” said Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at MUFG based in London. Against the dollar, the pound gained as much as 0.7 percent to $1.2945 but was steady against the euro and the Japanese yen. With Japan out for a week of holidays, traders are worried the absence of Tokyo, one of the world’s top five currency trading centers, might fuel some exaggerated moves in foreign exchange markets. Overall volatility in the currency markets remained near five-year lows. Despite the pound’s gains against the dollar, net positions by hedge funds in sterling slipped back into negative territory, according to the latest data.

1000,Senator Blumenthal seeks criminal investigation of shoddy military housing - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  8:20 PM / 2 months ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators demanded accountability for slum-like housing conditions on military bases across the country Thursday, with one calling for a criminal investigation of private landlords granted vast power over tenant housing. “There are clear indications of fraud,” Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, drawing applause from the crowd. “I would recommend that these issues be referred to the United States Department of Justice.” Blumenthal did not offer details during the hearing. Yet other senators described military families being charged questionable fees or being sickened by dangerous housing conditions. Last month, a survey of military families found deep dissatisfaction, countering a far rosier picture of tenant satisfaction presented by private contractors managing base housing. During Thursday’s hearing, the secretaries and chiefs of staff overseeing the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines told Congress of the steps they are taking to resolve escalating complaints of substandard housing. The Senate hearings were prompted by a Reuters investigation detailing health and safety concerns afflicting base housing, and describing how military families are armed with few rights to challenge powerful private industry landlords. Read the series at: reut.rs/2t1Y2UA On the eve of the hearing, the military branches unveiled a proposed tenant bill of rights that aims to hold private landlords more accountable for health and safety hazards. The branches are now conducting inspections nationwide. “We are going to have to keep our boot on the throat of the underperforming contractors,” said Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein. But under committee questioning, the service secretaries acknowledged they are still working out the fine print of the bill of rights, including how the protections will be enforced. One major hurdle: The services plan to renegotiate their 50-year contracts with landlords hired under the military’s privatization program. When the military began privatizing its housing in the 1990s, branches teamed with real estate firms who took responsibility for managing more than 200,000 family dwellings on bases. The partnerships receive nearly $4 billion in annual rent payments. “In the whole Bill of Rights, it will not work, it will be a puff piece, unless we link that into the agreements” with the companies, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer told senators. The Navy and Army are pushing to renegotiate the fees paid to private real estate firms, some of which are based on performance. Private operators did not testify Thursday, but in interviews, and in hearings last month, said they are committed to fixing flaws. The full cost of housing remediation has yet to be determined. Senators said they want contractors to pay. “By no means will we bail the contractors out and pass along the costs to the taxpayers,” said the committee’s chairman, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma. “That’s not going to happen.” Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina attacked the practice of housing operators using non-disclosure agreements to silence service members from speaking out. “Over the next 30 days I want to see every damn one of these canceled, unless you want to walk into my office with a housing provider that thinks it’s a good idea,” Tillis said. Also Thursday, senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris of California, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, pressed for action beyond the measures proposed by military leaders. Citing the Reuters series, the four introduced a bill that would require military officials to conduct stringent oversight of private landlords and ensure health hazards are addressed to the satisfaction of residents. Among other steps, the bill would force base commanders to withhold rent payments until a military housing official and the resident confirm health and safety threats were remediated. The measure also calls for the Secretary of Defense to withhold incentive fees from any contractor who persistently fails to remedy hazards. “Unfortunately, many living in private military housing are dealing with hazardous conditions with little or no recourse,” Feinstein said. “Our legislation would fix that.” Link to press release: tmsnrt.rs/2VHehmn Link to bill: tmsnrt.rs/2C4qSbR After the hearing, Air Force spouse Janna Driver said fixes have not come easily. Last month, Driver told Congress that while living on an Air Force base in Oklahoma, mold caused health problems, forced her family to vacate and left them $40,000 in debt. Driver told Reuters the military seems closer to fixing the problem, but that she was disappointed by how much more work remains. “I think we have a long way to go,” Driver said.

1001,Megaphones and more: Mueller details Russian U.S. election meddling - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  12:08 PM / 2 months ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - From breaking into computers to paying for a megaphone, Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. political system have been spelled out in detail by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has described an elaborate campaign of hacking and propaganda during the 2016 presidential race. While Mueller has yet to submit to U.S. Attorney General William Barr a final report on his investigation into Russia’s role in the election, the former FBI director already has provided a sweeping account in a pair of indictments that charged 25 Russian individuals and three Russian companies. Key questions still to be answered are whether Mueller will conclude that Trump’s campaign conspired with Moscow and whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied election interference. Here is an explanation of Mueller’s findings about Russian activities and U.S. intelligence assessments of the ongoing threat. On Feb. 16, 2018, Mueller charged 13 Russian individuals and three Russian entities with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire and bank fraud and identity theft. It said the Internet Research Agency, a Russian-backed propaganda arm known for trolling on social media, flooded American social media sites Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram to promote Trump and spread disparaging information about his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. The indictment said the Russian efforts dated to 2014, before Trump’s candidacy, and were intended to sow discord in the United States. The St. Petersburg-based so-called troll farm employed hundreds of people for its online operations and had a multimillion-dollar budget, according to the indictment. It had a management group and departments including graphics, data analysis and search-engine optimization. Employees worked day and night shifts corresponding to U.S. time zones. Its funding was provided by Evgeny Prigozhin, a businessman who U.S. officials have said has extensive ties to Russia’s military and political establishment, and companies he controlled including Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering. Prigozhin has been described by Russian media as being close to President Vladimir Putin. He has been dubbed “Putin’s cook” because his catering business has organized banquets for Russia’s president. The Russians targeted Americans with information warfare, adopting false online personas and creating hundreds of social media accounts to push divisive messages and spread distrust of candidates and America’s political system in general, the indictment said. They aimed to denigrate Clinton and support the candidacies of Trump, who won the Republican presidential nomination, and Bernie Sanders, her rival for the Democratic nomination. In Florida, a pivotal state in U.S. presidential elections, the Russians steered unwitting Americans to pro-Trump rallies they conceived and organized. The indictment said the Russians paid “a real U.S. person to wear a costume portraying Clinton in a prison uniform at a rally” and another “to build a cage large enough to hold an actress depicting Clinton in a prison uniform.” The accused Russians used false Facebook persona “Matt Skier” to contact a real American to recruit for a “March for Trump” rally, offering “money to print posters and get a megaphone,” the indictment said. They created an Instagram account “Woke Blacks” to encourage African-Americans not to vote for “Killary,” saying, “We’d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.” Fake social media accounts were used to post messages saying American Muslims should refuse to vote for Clinton “because she wants to continue the war on Muslims in the Middle East.” Alternatively, they took out Facebook ads promoting a June 2016 rally in Washington, “Support Hillary. Save American Muslims” rally. They recruited an American to hold up a sign with a quote falsely attributed to Clinton that embraced Islamic sharia law, the indictment said. Some of the accused Russians traveled around the United States to gather intelligence, the indictment said, visiting at least 10 states: California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Texas. On July 13, 2018, Mueller charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with hacking Democratic Party computer networks in 2016 to steal large amounts of data and then time their release to damage Clinton. The Russian hackers broke into the computer networks of the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, covertly monitoring employee computers and planting malicious code, as well as stealing emails and other documents, according to the indictment. Using fictitious online personas such as DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the hackers released tens of thousands of stolen emails and documents. The Guccifer 2.0 persona communicated with Americans, including an unidentified person who was in regular contact with senior members of the Trump campaign, the indictment said. Guccifer 2.0 cooperated extensively with “Organization 1” - the WikiLeaks website - to discuss the timing of the release of stolen documents to “heighten their impact” on the election. On or about July 27, 2016, the Russians tried to break into email accounts used by Clinton’s personal office and her campaign, the indictment said. The same day, candidate Trump told reporters: “Russia, if you are listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” referring to emails from a private server Clinton had used when she was secretary of state. To hide their identity, the Russians laundered money and financed their operation through cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Mueller’s team said. The U.S. intelligence community’s 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment report cited Russia’s continuing efforts to interfere in the American political system. It stated, “Russia’s social media efforts will continue to focus on aggravating social and racial tensions, undermining trust in authorities, and criticizing perceived anti-Russia politicians. Moscow may employ additional influence toolkits - such as spreading disinformation, conducting hack-and-leak operations or manipulating data - in a more targeted fashion to influence U.S. policy, actions and elections.” The report said Russia and “unidentified actors” as recently as 2018 conducted cyber activity targeting U.S. election infrastructure, though there is no evidence showing “any compromise of our nation’s election infrastructure that would have prevented voting, changed vote counts or disrupted the ability to tally votes.” (The story fixes typo, “has” in third paragraph) Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Will DunhamAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1002,Democrat Sherrod Brown says he will not enter 2020 White House race - Reuters,"March 7, 2019 /  5:47 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said on Thursday he would not enter the 2020 U.S. presidential race, but would work to help the party recapture the White House and battle Republican President Donald Trump’s “phony populism.” Brown, who just wrapped up an exploratory month-long tour of four early voting states, said he was confident the growing field of Democratic White House contenders would carry on his fight for workers. “We’ve seen candidates begin taking up the dignity of work fight, and we have seen voters across the country demanding it,” Brown said in a statement. “It is how we beat Trump, and it is how we should govern.” Talking to reporters outside the Senate chamber, he said he did not have a lifelong ambition to be president and the tour had been designed to elevate his pro-worker message within the party. “In that sense, it was mission accomplished,” Brown said. “I look forward to going back to the Senate where I think I can be most effective.” Brown, a liberal with strong ties to the labor movement, had not registered significant support in most opinion polls of a Democratic field that includes better-known fellow senators such as Kamala Harris of California, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. His decision is certain to increase speculation that former Vice President Joe Biden, another Democrat with a history of appealing to working-class voters, is likely to enter the race. Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas is also expected to announce a decision soon. Three other possible Democratic contenders - former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, and U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon - also announced this week that they would not run. Brown had easily won re-election to the Senate in November in Ohio, even though Republicans captured every other statewide office. That feat impressed many Democrats looking to take back the industrial states Trump swept on his way to victory in 2016, and sparked talk about a Brown candidacy. On his exploratory tour, Brown argued he could be a unifying force in a party debating whether to focus on winning back working-class voters or rallying the suburban, women and minority voters who fueled the party’s gains in November’s congressional elections. “It’s not an either/or,” Brown said when he kicked off the tour in late January. “We can do both.”     Reporting by John Whitesides, additional reporting by Richard Cowan; editing by Mohammad Zargham and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1003,Euro zone bank lending slowed in March: ECB - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  8:11 AM / in 8 days","2 Min ReadFRANKFURT, April 29 (Reuters) - Corporate and household lending growth in the euro zone slowed last month, European Central Bank data showed on Monday, a potential sign that banks are restricting credit amid the bloc’s economic slowdown. Corporate lending growth slowed to 3.5 percent in March from 3.8 percent in February, well below its post-crisis peak of 4.3 percent hit in September. With economic growth slowing sharply on weak export demand for manufactured goods, the ECB has already put plans to normalise policy on hold, announcing instead further stimulus measures to aid bank lending and prop up a still limping economy. Fearing that banks will shut the flow of credit to firms amid a slowdown, the ECB said it would give lenders a new line of ultra cheap loans with the ultimate aim of getting cash to firms so they continue to invest. Credit growth to households meanwhile slowed to 3.2 percent in March from 3.3 percent a month earlier, the ECB data showed. Still, the annual growth rate of the M3 measure of money supply, which often foreshadows future activity, unexpectedly rose to 4.5 percent from 4.3 percent a month earlier, beating gloomier forecasts for 4.2 percent.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged higher by 0730 GMT, with Italy’s FTMIB inching higher after S&P affirmed the country’s sovereign ratings but Spain’s IBEX lagged on uncertainty related to a government formation at the centre. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is set to regain power after his Socialists overcame a historic challenge by right-wing nationalists but will need the help of regional parties, or the centre right, to form a government. In earnings, Spain’s state-owned lender Bankia climbed 2 percent as after the company’s net profit for first quarter came in slightly ahead of expectations. SMCP rose 5 percent after the French fashion group reported a rise in first-quarter revenues on Monday and kept its guidance for a higher annual sales growth and stable profit margins. SAS slipped 5 percent after the Scandinavian airline cancelled more than 1,200 flights scheduled for Monday and Tuesday as a pilot strike entered its third day on Sunday. Oil stocks lagged after President Donald Trump demanded that producer club OPEC raise output to soften the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Bayer dropped about 2 percent as shareholders rebuked the German drugmaker’s top bosses amid anger over a stock price slump as litigation risks mount from the takeover of seed maker Monsanto. Bayer which has lost more than a third in market value since August was also trading ex-dividend on the day.

1005,FOREX-Dollar rally pauses underlining slowdown fears - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:46 AM / in 8 days","3 Min Read* Major currencies hold to tight ranges * Investors await Fed meeting, U.S. inflation and jobs data * Japan closed all week, China closed Wednesday-Friday * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tom Finn and Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - A rally in the dollar faltered on Monday with strong U.S. data doing little to lift the currency or convince investors that a slowdown in activity is over. The greenback traded in a narrow range as Japan kicked off a week of holidays. The break gives traders pause before a Federal Reserve policy meeting and a raft of global data including on U.S. core inflation and payrolls. All eyes are on the Fed to see what its policymakers made of a first-quarter gross domestic product report that showed strong growth of 3.2 percent, but largely for one-off reasons including a surge in inventories. “If the market’s reaction to Friday’s U.S. GDP data is any guide, investors still seem more concerned over a slowdown in activity and slowing inflation,” said Chris Turner, head of currency strategy at ING in London. “Unless European and Chinese growth figures deliver some impressive recoveries this week, expect the dollar to benefit by default,” he added. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction softer at 97.970, having eased from a near two-year peak of 98.330. The dollar fell back on Friday despite the upbeat GDP report because core inflation slowed sharply, leading speculators to narrow the odds on a rate cut this year. The aggregate dollar long position climbed to $33.6 billion on Monday, its highest level since December 2015, according to Scotiabank’s weekly CFTC sentiment report. The euro remains the largest held net short. Most other major central banks have also turned dovish in recent months, keeping their currencies subdued. The Canadian dollar and Swedish crown, for instance, both took hits last week when their central banks put a halt on future rate hikes. The European Central Bank is under pressure to keep its stimulus in place, if not to do a new round, while markets are pricing in rate cuts for Australia and New Zealand following weak inflation readings. Some fear the lack of liquidity could lead to a re-run of the dollar’s flash crash from January when the yen made massive gains in a matter of minutes as bears were forced to cover short positions. The euro was a shade firmer at $1.1157, but still not far from a near two-year trough of $1.1110. The euro has been broadly pushing lower since early January. A swathe of manufacturing surveys from Europe and China are due later this week, along with a first reading on EU GDP. The U.S. payrolls report on Friday is forecast to show a solid increase of 180,000 in April, with unemployment at 3.8 percent. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney

1006,Shareholders say Bayer bosses need more time after AGM rebuke - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  7:30 AM / 8 days ago","2 Min ReadFRANKFURT, April 29 (Reuters) - Two of Bayer’s largest German investors said the drugmaker’s embattled management needed to stay at the helm for now to avoid further upheaval, despite a share price slump in the wake of the $63 billion Monsanto takeover. The backing for Chief Executive Werner Baumann comes after an unprecedented rebuke at the annual shareholder meeting on Friday, where a majority of investors cast a vote of disapproval of top management’s actions. “A hasty replacement of the CEO would only increase the risk of a break-up and therefore can’t be in the interest of long-term oriented investors such as Union Investment,” said Janne Werning, an analyst at Germany’s Union Investment which is a top-20 shareholder. “The scale of the litigation risks won’t become clearer before next year, that’s why we think it’s fair and necessary to grant top management more time,” he said in a written statement over the weekend. About 30 billion euros ($33 billion) have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found it liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. More than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. Bayer shares traded 1.9 percent lower by 0725 GMT on Monday. Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the verdicts and has pointed to global regulators’ findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is safe. Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Deka Investment, said on Friday that management change would only compound the chaos. “It can’t be in anyone’s interest to see the daily operations being neglected, on top of all the existing chaos,” he said at the AGM. Deka and Union had been among top-20 investors who cast a ‘No’ vote in the company’s annual AGM poll to ratify management’s business conduct during the year under review.

1007,Deutsche Bank chair against strategy change at investment bank: FT - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  6:57 AM / in 8 days","3 Min ReadBERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner told the Financial Times that Germany’s largest lender did not need to fundamentally overhaul its investment bank after attempts to create a German champion with Commerzbank failed. Achleitner defended Deutsche Bank’s strategy after merger talks with Commerzbank failed due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. “Every executive has to constantly adjust to a changing market environment ... but in this regard, we are not talking about strategy, we are talking about execution,” Achleitner told the paper. The idea of merging with Commerzbank has now been abandoned “once and for all” Achleitner said, adding that Deutsche Bank is aware that Commerzbank could be taken over by a foreign lender. Deutsche Bank has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. It is trying to turn itself around, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests.  Turnaround efforts will continue but no fundamental strategy shift is underway, Achleitner said.  “In particular, in a business like the capital markets one, which is so volatile and so rapidly changing, there will be permanent adjustments,” said Achleitner, who was seen as a backer of the proposed merger with Commerzbank. He said that was his personal view. Earnings released on Friday showed net revenue at Deutsche’s sprawling global investment bank, which accounts for more than half the German bank’s overall revenue and which relies heavily on its bond trading earnings, fell 13 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.68 billion) in the first quarter. Even strong players such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have shown weaker revenues in bond trading, an area where Deutsche has been strong. On being asked whether Deutsche Bank would have needed 10 billion euros in extra capital to finance the Commerzbank merger, Achleitner told the Financial Times that this number was “excessive”. Deutsche Bank has considered a significant restructuring of its United States operations after the lender failed stress tests. The Federal Reserve this month said it would relax the capital and stress test requirements for the subsidiaries of foreign banks.

1008,"GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S., China data send Asian shares higher, Europe to follow - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  6:30 AM / 8 days ago","5 Min Read* Stocks in Europe expected to open higher * MSCI Asia ex-Japan adds 0.5 pct; Chinese A-shares bounce * U.S. reports faster growth; China industrial profits up * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Andrew Galbraith and Noah Sin SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, April 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares climbed on Monday, with markets in Europe poised to track their gains, after strong U.S. first-quarter economic growth and data showing profits at Chinese industrial firms grew for the first time in four months. Still nagged by uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, investors were awaiting a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve this week and Chinese factory data for further clues on policy direction in the world’s biggest economies. In early European trade for index futures, London’s FTSE was 0.2 percent higher while Germany’s DAX edged up 0.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.5 percent, rebounding from its biggest weekly drop in more than a month last week. Chinese blue-chips jumped over 1 percent after losing 5.6 percent last week, leading Shanghai shares to an intraday high in afternoon trade. Australian shares were down 0.4 percent after hitting an 11-year closing high on Friday, while Seoul’s KOSPI was up 1.4 percent. Japan’s financial markets are closed for a long national holiday this week, but Nikkei 225 futures in Singapore was 0.9 percent higher. Monday’s gains follow data showing U.S. gross domestic product grew at a faster 3.2 percent annualised rate in the first quarter. In China, fresh data showed industrial profits grew in March after four months of contraction, but analysts said sentiment remained fragile. Economists polled by Reuters expect factory activity in the world’s second largest economy to grow at a steady but modest pace in April. “Investors are still looking for direction in terms of growth, but at the same time there is still quite a lot of uncertainty” on U.S.-China trade and the U.S. dollar, said Joanne Goh, equity strategist at DBS Bank in Singapore. “A strong U.S. dollar doesn’t really bode well for Asian markets,” she added. In contrast with weakness in Asian markets last week, Wall Street ended Friday on a high note, propelled by the GDP figures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.31 percent to 26,543.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added or 0.34 percent to 8,146.40. The S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent to 2,939.88, its second record closing high for the week. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said that despite stronger-than-expected earnings helping to lift markets, he saw investors’ positioning on the S&P becoming “overly extended”. “We have flipped from a state where it is a stock rally no one wants to take part in, to a frenzied paced splurge where hedge funds and investors alike continue to chase markets like greyhounds to the mechanical rabbit,” he said in a note. While the strong U.S. GDP data helped to ease fears of an imminent recession, investors noted that it was driven by a smaller trade deficit and a large accumulation of unsold merchandise, as consumer and business spending slowed sharply. The March reading for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s favoured inflation measure, is due later on Monday. The central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its policy decision on Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell expected to balance the strong domestic growth data against persistent concerns over the global outlook. Markets will also be looking to global factory activity surveys this week, particularly official and private readings on Chinese manufacturing which will both be released Tuesday. Chinese firms return to profit growth in March fueled doubts over how much more stimulus Beijing can roll out without risking a rapid build-up in debt and potential asset bubbles. “The hope that there will be more stimulus coming out from China probably is diminishing,” said Goh at DBS. “So if the FOMC confirms that the Fed continues to be quite dovish about the outlook for interest rates, I think investors will quite like that,” she said. With Japan on an extended break, currency markets were calm ahead of the FOMC meeting and U.S. jobs numbers. The dollar was pretty much flat against the yen at 111.61, and the euro was up 0.09 percent to $1.1158. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, turned 0.04 percent lower to 97.970. U.S. crude dipped 0.65 percent at $62.89 a barrel, continuing lower after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. Brent crude fell 0.61 percent to $71.71 per barrel. Spot gold was down 0.1 percent, trading at $1,284.73 per ounce. Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1010,"FOREX-Dollar dozes, risks rude awakening from US inflation - Reuters","April 29, 2019 /  6:05 AM / 8 days ago","4 Min Read* Major currencies hold to tight ranges in Asia * Japan closed all week, China closed Wednesday-Friday * Investors await Fed meeting, U.S. inflation and jobs data By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 29 (Reuters) - The dollar dozed in a snug band on Monday as Japan kicked off a week of holidays, giving investors an extra excuse to idle ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting and a raft of global data including on U.S. core inflation and payrolls. Movements were minimal with the dollar keeping to a mere 14-tick range on the yen and not much more on the euro. Liquidity is set to be puddle deep in Asia this week with China also off from Wednesday to Friday. All eyes are on the Fed to see what its policymakers made of a first-quarter gross domestic product report that showed strong growth of 3.2 percent, but largely for one-off reasons including a surge in inventories. Core inflation, on the other hand, surprised by slowing sharply, leading speculators to actually narrow the odds on a rate cut this year. Fed fund futures now imply a rate of 2.20 percent by the year end, from 2.41 percent now. The March reading for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), the Fed’s favoured inflation measure, is due later Monday and there is a risk it might slow to 1.6 percent or even 1.5 percent. “The single biggest macro issue at the moment concerns Fed policy and whether inflation is soft enough to justify an ‘insurance’ rate cut - or two,” said analysts at JPMorgan. “Chicago Fed President Charles Evans has implied a sustained core PCE at 1.5 percent would justify “insurance” cuts even with growth staying healthy and investors will be listening very closely to (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell on Wednesday for any hints about his thoughts on this topic.” It was this risk that saw the dollar fall back on Friday despite the upbeat GDP report. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a fraction softer at 97.970, having eased from a near two-year peak of 98.330. Yet the dollar is hardly alone given pretty much every other major central bank has also turned dovish in recent months, keeping their currencies subdued. The Canadian dollar and Swedish crown, for instance, both took hits last week when their central banks put a halt on future rate hikes. The European Central Bank is under pressure to keep its stimulus in place, if not to do a new round, while markets are pricing in rate cuts for Australia and New Zealand following weak inflation readings. The Bank of Japan last week pledged to keep its policy super easy for at least another year, in an effort to dispel talk it was wavering in its commitment. While the yen gained at the end of last week, that was mainly because speculators chose to cut short positions ahead of this week’s extended Japanese holiday. Some fear the lack of liquidity could lead to a re-run of the dollar’s flash crash from January when the yen made massive gains in a matter of minutes as bears were forced to cover short positions. On Monday, the dollar was parked at 111.60 yen, having briefly touched its highest this year last week around 112.39. Chart support comes in at 111.37 and 110.83. The euro was a shade firmer at $1.1157, but still not far from a near two-year trough of $1.1110. A swathe of manufacturing surveys from Europe and China are due later this week, along with a first reading on EU GDP. The U.S. payrolls report on Friday is forecast to show a solid increase of 180,000 in April, with unemployment at 3.8 percent.

1011,Deutsche Bank chair against strategy change at investment bank - FT - Reuters,"April 29, 2019 /  5:20 AM / 8 days ago","2 Min ReadBERLIN, April 29 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank Chairman Paul Achleitner told the Financial Times that Germany’s largest lender did not need a fundamental overhaul of its investment division after merger talks with rival Commerzbank failed. German hopes of creating a national banking champion able to challenge global competitors were dashed on Thursday when Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank ended merger talks due to the risks of doing a deal, restructuring costs and capital demands. Defending the turnaround efforts of Deutsche’s investment division, supervisory board head Achleitner said: “Every executive has to constantly adjust to a changing market environment . . . But in this regard, we are not talking about strategy, we are talking about execution.” “In particular, in a business like the capital markets one, which is so volatile and so rapidly changing, there will be permanent adjustments,” said Achleitner, who was seen as a backer of the proposed merger with Commerzbank. He said that was his personal view. Earnings released on Friday showed net revenue at Deutsche’s sprawling global investment bank, which accounts for more than half the German bank’s overall revenue and which relies heavily on its bond trading earnings, fell 13 percent to 3.3 billion euros ($3.68 billion) in the first quarter. Deutsche Bank has struggled to generate sustainable profits since the 2008 financial crisis. It is trying to turn itself around under new leadership, but has faced hurdles such as allegations of money laundering and failed stress tests. $1 = 0.8962 euros

1013,Ex-Trump attorney Cohen hands over new documents to Congress - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  8:47 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen provided the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee with new documents and may hand over more, the panel’s chairman said after a day-long hearing behind closed doors. Democratic Representative Adam Schiff told reporters that Cohen was cooperative and the eight-hour hearing was “very productive.” He did not say what the new documents related to and declined to comment on the substance of Cohen’s testimony. “We had requested documents of Mr. Cohen. He has provided additional documents to the committee. There may be additional documents that he still has to offer and his cooperation with our committee continues,” Schiff said.  Cohen shared documents with lawmakers showing edits made to written testimony he provided to Congress in 2017, saying that an unsuccessful plan by Trump to build a tower in Moscow ended in January 2016, a congressional source said, confirming reports by CNN and the New York Times. Cohen subsequently pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in the testimony. He has since said pursuit of the Moscow project continued until June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. During testimony last week, Cohen said Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s lawyers, was among those who edited the 2017 document. Sekulow has called Cohen’s assertion “completely false.” During the 2016 presidential campaign Trump denied he had any business dealings with Russia but has since defended the proposed tower project. Cohen in public testimony last week before a different House committee, called Trump, his employer for more than 10 years, a “racist,” “conman” and “cheat.”  Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, said in a statement that Cohen has now spent 16 hours testifying before the intelligence committee. “Mr. Cohen responded to all questions truthfully and has agreed at the request of chairman Schiff to provide additional information in the future, if needed. He also offered to answer additional questions from Republican members. He remains committed to telling the truth and cooperating with authorities,” Davis added. Two congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Cohen was also due to face questions from lawmakers on the issue of a pardon from his former boss. The sources added that Trump’s representatives maintain that Cohen’s team first raised the issue of receiving a pardon while the former lawyer’s representatives have said the opposite. Intelligence panel members also were expected to question Cohen on Wednesday about Trump’s discussions with advisers in 2017 about how to respond when news reports first surfaced revealing that senior campaign figures including his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in June 2016 with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, one of the sources said. Trump’s son arranged the meeting after being promised “dirt” on Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. When news of the meeting broke, Trump Jr. issued a statement saying it was set up to discuss adoption policy, not politics. He later admitted he had been expecting intelligence on Clinton. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is completing an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia and whether the president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction, Russia has denied election interference. Cohen is due to report to prison on May 6 to begin a three-year sentence after pleading guilty in a separate case last year to criminal charges including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations.

1014,Democrats bar Fox News from moderating debates after reported Trump ties - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  6:35 PM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday said it will not allow Fox News to host any of its candidates’ political debates through 2020, citing a report this week about the conservative channel’s ties to U.S. President Donald Trump. “Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement provided to Reuters.     “Therefore, Fox News will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 Democratic primary debates,” Perez said in a statement. Representatives for Fox said they hoped the DNC would reconsider and let some of its journalists moderate a Democratic presidential debate.  Trump responded to the announcement by saying he may refuse to participate in certain debates. “I think I’ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!” he said in a Twitter post.  Trump has criticized CNN and MSNBC, among other media, as “Fake News” for their coverage of his administration. The DNC’s decision is a rerun of the 2016 primary election, when it turned down Fox’s multiple offers to host a debate, citing the network’s longstanding conservative bent and prominent criticism of Democratic policies. At that time a Democrat, Barack Obama, occupied the Oval Office. Trump, a Republican seeking re-election in 2020, has stoked polarization between the two U.S. political parties by appealing to his base on Twitter and television and policy speeches while simultaneously publicly attacking and feuding with prominent Democrats. The New Yorker earlier this week reported on “seamlessly” close ties between Trump and the television network founded by  Rupert Murdoch, citing an expert on presidential studies who said Fox is the “closest we’ve come to having state t.v.” The article went on to describe the access and interviews that members of the White House have granted exclusively to the network. As the field of competition to become Democrats’ next presidential nominee grows ever more crowded, the party has decided to split its first primary debate over two weeknights this summer. Twelve people have already jumped into the race and the DNC has capped each debate night at 20 candidates. The party’s primary debates this year will mark a sharp reversal from its last round of contests, when less than half a dozen politicians appeared at a handful of debates that were televised on Saturday nights and other times with notoriously low television viewership.

1015,Why Mueller's report might be a letdown for Trump critics - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  12:04 PM / 2 months ago","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lavishly detailed 445-page report by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr released by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998 concluded that President Bill Clinton “committed acts that may constitute grounds for an impeachment” and paved the way for an unsuccessful attempt in Congress to remove him from office. But Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s impending report on the findings of his investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election may far fall short of the searing and voluminous Starr report, legal experts said, in part due to constraints on Mueller that did not exist when Starr produced his report. The Starr report presented explicit details about Clinton’s sexual encounters with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky and accused Clinton of specific crimes including perjury, attempted obstruction of justice, witness tampering and “a pattern of conduct that was inconsistent with his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.” Starr operated under an independent counsel law that has since lapsed. Mueller’s powers differ from those of Starr, and Justice Department regulations place limits on him that Starr did not face. Mueller since May 2017 has looked into whether Trump’s 2016 campaign conspired with Russia and whether the president unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump has denied collusion and obstruction. Russia has denied election interference. Here is an explanation of some of the factors that may limit what ends up in Mueller’s report to U.S. Attorney General William Barr and what ultimately may be released to the public. Congress let the independent counsel law expire in part because of concern among some lawmakers that Starr had exceeded his mandate. The Justice Department then crafted regulations to create the job of special counsel in 1999, with certain limits on powers.  The department’s No. 2 official, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Mueller to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, whose agency had led the probe, and directed Mueller to abide by the special counsel regulations. But the regulations provide only limited guidance on the parameters of Mueller’s final report, stating that at the conclusion of his work he should provide the U.S. attorney general, the nation’s top law enforcement official, with a “confidential report” explaining his “prosecution or declination decisions.” The term “declination decisions” refers to judgments that Mueller made not to bring criminal charges against a given individual. Mueller already has brought charges against 34 people - including the former chairman of Trump’s campaign Paul Manafort and other campaign figures, Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn - and three Russian companies. The regulations require Barr to notify the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees that Mueller’s investigation has concluded. The Justice Department’s policy calls for Barr to summarize the confidential report for Congress with “an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.” According to the regulations, Barr “may determine that public release of these reports would be in the public interest, to the extent that release would comply with applicable legal restrictions.” In his January Senate confirmation hearing, Barr provided some insight into his thinking. He said that “it is very important that the public and Congress be informed of the results of the special counsel’s work.” Barr added, “For that reason, my goal will be to provide as much transparency as I can consistent with the law. I can assure you that, where judgments are to be made by me, I will make those judgments based solely on the law and will let no personal, political or other improper interests influence my decision.” House Democrats have vowed to subpoena the report and go to court if necessary to win its full release. Some legal experts said the text of the 1999 regulations and the context under which they were written in the aftermath of the Starr report signal that Mueller should not write a lengthy narrative like Starr did, but rather deliver straightforward and concise findings. The regulations were intended to give a special counsel some independence while ensuring a degree of accountability and oversight by the Justice Department. But some experts said Mueller would be well within his power to provide Congress with information it can use to conduct further investigations. Leon Jaworski, who served as a special prosecutor during President Richard Nixon’s Watergate scandal, adopted this approach when he finished his investigation. Jaworski’s “road map” document, which helped prompt Nixon’s resignation, remained secret until 2018. Comey, in a Washington Post opinion piece on Tuesday, urged Barr to make an expansive release, saying “a straightforward report of what facts have been learned and how judgment has been exercised may be the only way to advance the public interest.” There is a tension between a decades-old Justice Department policy against public comment on decisions not to bring criminal charges and the requirement in the special counsel regulations that Mueller explain which criminal cases he brought and which ones he declined to bring. Rosenstein in February said, “If we aren’t prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens.” This policy might lead Mueller to keep his explanations of his declination decisions brief, legal experts said, and Barr subsequently could opt not to disclose those parts of the confidential report. Department policy, presented in a 1973 Nixon-era memo and reaffirmed in a 2000 Clinton-era memo, is that a sitting president cannot face a criminal indictment. Some lawyers have said this policy, combined with the practice of generally not explaining decisions not to prosecute someone, limits what Mueller can put in the report about Trump’s conduct. Other lawyers have said Jaworski, who had an analogous role, set a precedent that Mueller would be within his power to lay out a case for removing Trump from office through impeachment, as Starr did with Clinton in 1998.

1017,"Brazil's Petrobras details refinery, other asset sale plans - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  10:37 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petrobras on Friday for the first time detailed long-awaited plans to sell a series of refineries and other assets as the company focuses on its core oil and gas exploration business. Petrobras, or Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said its board had approved a plan to sell eight refineries in Brazil, including its large, recently built Abreu e Lima unit, according to a securities filing. The company also said it will sell a gas station chain in Uruguay, called PUDSA, and an additional stake in Brazil’s No. 1 fuel distribution company BR Distribuidora SA as part of a massive divestment drive that aims to cut debt and raise money to be invested in its core oil exploration area. Petrobras, which currently has a 71 percent stake in BR Distribuidora, said it is evaluating a secondary share offering to reduce its stake in that business.  A source with direct knowledge of the decisions taken by the board told Reuters earlier on Friday that the oil company could reduce its stake in BR to as low as 40 percent. Petrobras said that among the other refining assets to be put up for sale are its Gabriel Passos unit, located in central Minas Gerais state, the Getúlio Vargas refinery, in southern Paraná state and the Landulpho Alves unit, in northern Bahia state, one of the largest refineries in the country with capacity to process 323,000 barrels per day. The Abreu e Lima unit is emblematic. Launched in 2005 as a joint project for Brazil and Venezuela, in a collaboration of the leftist governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Hugo Chavez, the unit had successive cost overruns that led to total capital expenditure of around $20 billion from an initial estimate of $2.3 billion. Venezuela’s PDVSA later abandoned the project, that was partially concluded in 2014.

1019,New Mexico City airport to go in service by mid-2021: official - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  9:51 PM / 11 days ago","3 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A new Mexico City airport intended to replace a project canceled by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador should be ready for use in mid-2021 with a starting capacity of 20 million passengers per year, a senior official said on Friday. Brigadier General Ricardo Vallejo, head of the military college of engineers, told a news conference the first phase of the airport to be built north of Mexico City by the town of Santa Lucia should be completed by June 2021. “However, its maximum potential, its development potential, will be over 50 years,” Vallejo said.  He said the airport, due to be built by the military, would begin with an annual capacity for 20 million passengers that could eventually rise to 80 million. The new airport has divided opinion since Lopez Obrador in October abruptly canceled a $13 billion partially built hub a few weeks before taking office. He argued that the facility on Mexico City’s eastern flank was tainted by corruption and too costly. Lopez Obrador’s decision sparked a major sell-off in Mexican financial assets. Critics of the new project also argue that Santa Lucia’s distance from the capital could hurt tourism by complicating travel for connecting flights from Mexico City. Santa Lucia lies some 29 miles (47 km) north of the current Benito Juarez International Airport. Still, some engineering experts say the two hubs may not be able to operate simultaneously. Transport and Communications Minister Javier Jimenez Espriu rejects that view. He told the news conference a third terminal would be added to the Benito Juarez airport where the presidential hangar previously stood. That would raise the current airport’s capacity to 50 million passengers a year, Jimenez said. The government aims to save billions of dollars with the Santa Lucia site. But questions remain about carrying out the plan, in part due to the government’s own statements. In December, Lopez Obrador said construction on the Santa Lucia hub would start in January. Earlier this week he said construction would begin next Monday. At the news conference on Friday he said construction would begin in June, “once we have all the requirements.” Writing by Dave Graham; Editing by Tom BrownAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1021,Shareholders rebuke Bayer bosses over Monsanto-linked stock rout - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  8:52 PM / in 11 days","3 Min ReadBONN (Reuters) - Bayer shareholders on Friday cast a vote of disapproval of the German drugmaker’s top management amid anger over a stock price slump as litigation risks mount from the $63 billion takeover of seed maker Monsanto. A 55.5 percent majority of shareholders at its annual general meeting voted against ratifying the executive board’s business conduct during 2018, the company said. Such a vote, which features prominently at every German AGM, is largely symbolic because it has no bearing on management’s liability or tenure but it is seen as a key gauge of investor sentiment. Bayer’s non-executive supervisory board, in turn, won a 66.4 percent majority of the votes ratifying its business conduct during 2018, the spokesman said.  About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) have been wiped off Bayer’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found the pesticide and drugs group liable because Monsanto had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. Bayer suffered a similar defeat last month, while more than 13,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. Bayer is appealing or plans to appeal the verdicts and has pointed to global regulators’ findings that the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is safe. No incumbent executive board members at companies listed in Germany’s blue-chip index DAX has flunked the vote, meaning receiving an approval vote of less than 50 percent at an AGM. Approval rates above 95 percent are typical results. In a recent low for a company leadership team, former Deutsche Bank co-CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen scored approval ratings of about 61 percent during the bank’s 2015 AGM. Both announced their resignation within weeks. Top 20 Bayer investors who earlier on Friday said they would cast a ‘no’ vote included Deka Investment and Union Investment. “The vote is a disgrace. To be gambling away the trust of so many investors within such a short time has historic proportions,” said Ingo Speich, head of sustainability and corporate governance at Deka Investment. He added he hoped management will listen more to shareholders in future. This month, shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis recommended that investors not give the executive board their seal of approval. Earlier on Friday, various shareholders vented their anger at the AGM. CEO Baumann said Bayer’s true value was not reflected in the current share price. “There’s no way to make this look good. The lawsuits and the first verdicts weigh heavily on our company and it’s a concern for many people,” he said, adding it was the right decision to buy Monsanto and that Bayer was vigorously defending itself.

1022,U.S. GDP data boosts stocks; S&P 500 posts record close - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  12:29 AM / 11 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rose and the S&P 500 notched a record closing high for the second time this week on Friday as data showed U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate, and the surge in growth put to rest fears of a recession. Results late Thursday from Amazon.com, whose shares gained 2.5% on Friday, boosted expectations for the profit outlook, even as Intel Corp cut its full-year revenue forecast and Exxon Mobil and Chevron shares fell following their results. The GDP number was a positive for the market, and investors seem satisfied with earnings despite some negative surprises, said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “There’s a lot of momentum buying, and with the thought that new highs are likely, there is continued optimism,” he said. “The one thing about this market and its long rally is as it’s done well, it’s dragged more believers into it, and it’s sort of self-fulfilling.” Expectations for first-quarter S&P 500 earnings have improved since the start of the reporting period, with earnings now projected to have declined just 0.3% from a year ago, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The GDP report was not all upbeat, however. The jump in U.S. economic growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. The dollar index fell 0.18%. The index, which hit a 23-month high earlier in the session, was up for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.25 points, or 0.31%, to 26,543.33, the S&P 500 gained 13.71 points, or 0.47%, to 2,939.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.72 points, or 0.34%, to 8,146.40.     The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.22% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.36%. The GDP release sets the stage for a Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, when investors will try to anticipate how the U.S. central bank will react to mostly resilient indicators of late.  The rebound has not been mirrored in inflation, which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish. Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year. The Fed next week is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts published on Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.5%, from 2.534% late on Thursday. Oil prices sank after U.S. President Donald Trump again pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to settle at $63.30 a barrel. Brent crude futures settled down nearly 3% at $72.15. (Graphic: World FX rates in 2019   link: tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh).

1023,Uber unveils IPO terms that are well below expectations - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  10:58 AM / in 11 days","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc, the world’s largest ride-hailing company, plans an initial public offering that values the company as much as one-third below what the startup’s insiders had hoped for, between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion.  The valuation, outlined in a regulatory filing on Friday, is less than the $120 billion that investment bankers told Uber last year it could fetch, and closer to the $76 billion valuation it attained in a private fundraising round in 2018. The lower valuation reflects the poor stock performance of smaller rival Lyft Inc following its IPO last month. Lyft shares ended trading on Friday down 20.5 percent from the IPO price, amid investor skepticism over the company’s path to profitability. Lyft completed its IPO at a valuation of $24.3 billion, which corresponded to around 11 times its 2018 revenue. By comparison, the top end of Uber’s valuation target is around eight times revenue last year.  “We believe that recent price reductions for both Uber and Lyft may be indicative of investor hesitance to invest in highly capital-intensive, deeply unprofitable and untested business models at this late stage of the economic cycle,” PitchBook analyst Asad Hussain said.  In the filing, Uber set a target price range of $44 to $50 per share for its IPO. The company will sell 180 million shares in the offering to raise up to $9 billion, with a further 27 million sold by existing investors for as much as $1.35 billion.  Reuters reported this month that the combined value of Uber shares sold in the IPO would be around $10 billion. The Uber IPO would rank as the largest in the United States since that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014. The updated public filing comes as Uber begins its 10-day investor road show, in which management will pitch the company to public markets investors. Uber executives kicked off the road show in New York on Friday. They will host an investor presentation in London on Monday, before returning to the United States for visits to New York a second time, and to Boston, San Francisco and the Midwest. Uber expects to price the IPO on May 9 and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day, people familiar with the matter have said.    Of the stock being sold in the IPO by existing Uber investors, 6.86 million shares are from Uber co-founders Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, meaning the two men could jointly pocket $343 million if the IPO prices at the top end of its current range.  Uber will face a host of questions from investors, including when it will turn a profit, how it will navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles, and whether its business model can support higher driver costs from minimum wage rules.  Underscoring the company’s ability to generate revenue but also the scale of its losses, Uber reported in the filing a net loss attributable to the company for the first quarter of 2019 of around $1 billion on sales of roughly $3 billion.  “When it comes to Uber, we believe there are still questions over the current car-sharing model, the economics of which are not immediately or obviously attractive for sustainable, long-term investment,” Mark Hargraves, head of Framlington Global Equities, wrote in a note.  Uber also said PayPal had agreed to purchase $500 million of stock in a private placement at the price at which the IPO eventually settles. The two companies said they were extending an existing partnership to “explore future commercial payment collaborations.” This agreement is similar to when Comcast Corp’s NBCUniversal invested $500 million in Snapchat owner Snap Inc, around the time of the latter’s IPO in 2017.  Two other IPOs this month, those of online scrapbook company Pinterest Inc and video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc, have performed much better than Lyft. Uber, however, has chosen to value itself conservatively. One advantage Uber will likely seek to emphasize to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it does business, as well as that it operates around the world.  Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber’s business model to become profitable. Unlike Lyft, Uber also has a restaurant delivery business, Uber Eats, which generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year and competes with the likes of Grubhub Inc and DoorDash. During Uber’s IPO road show, Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the company’s culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years. Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. The Uber IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs & Co  and Bank Of America Merrill Lynch.

1024,"S&P, Nasdaq notch record closes from GDP, earnings boost - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  11:37 AM / in 11 days","5 Min ReadNew York (Reuters) - A surprisingly strong report card on the U.S. economy helped power the benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes to record high closes on Friday, capping a week of gains for stocks that came largely on the back of resilient corporate profits. While Intel Corp was the biggest drag on the day after it gave a bleak outlook, Amazon.com’s results provided the biggest boost and Walt Disney also offered support as it basked in strong box office numbers. After staying close to flat for much of the day the S&P, Nasdaq and the Dow gained ground in the last hour of trading to register their second record closes for the week. The S&P’s peak for the day was a point below its intraday record.   Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey, said the GDP number was a positive for the market, and investors were satisfied with earnings despite some negative surprises. “There’s a lot of momentum buying. And with the thought that new highs are likely, there is continued optimism.” said Meckler, adding that the ongoing equity rally has “dragged more believers into it, and it’s sort of self-fulfilling.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.25 points, or 0.31%, to 26,543.33, the S&P 500 gained 13.71 points, or 0.47%, to 2,939.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.72 points, or 0.34%, to 8,146.40.  For the week, the S&P rose 1.2%, while the Dow lost 0.06%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.86%.  After a late 2018 sell-off, stocks have rallied this year in large part due to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve as well as hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution. Before the market open, U.S. Commerce Department data showed gross domestic product rising faster than expected due to high inventories while consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and homebuilding investment contracted for a fifth straight quarter.   “The economy’s not going off a cliff. Some of the numbers were a little soft but everything that could have gone wrong this week didn’t,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago.  “Earnings season has been mixed but it’s been a net positive,” said Battle. “The theater now pivots from earnings season to the Fed meeting next week.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve meeting is due to start on Tuesday. The S&P’s biggest boost on Friday was from the consumer discretionary sector, which rose 0.9%.  Its biggest support was from Amazon.com Inc, which rose 2.5% after the e-commerce giant’s quarterly profit doubled and beat Wall Street estimates though its second quarter guidance was lower than expectations.     Also Ford Motor Co surged 10.7% and was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. The S&P’s technology index was the biggest drag on the benchmark, with a 0.4% decline.    Intel slumped 8.99% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed the sales estimate for its key data center business in its quarterly report late Thursday.  Out of the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors, energy was the biggest percentage loser with a 1.2% drop as oil prices sank more than 3 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump again pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. [O/R] Also, shares in oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp fell 2% after its quarterly profit missed estimates. Walt Disney Co rose 1.95% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle “Avengers: Endgame” hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.11-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 72 new highs and 39 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.45 billion shares, compared to the 6.64 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

1026,"White House pressures automakers on fuel rules, blocking California: sources - Reuters","March 6, 2019 /  4:18 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is pressuring automakers to back its effort to roll back Obama-era fuel economy standards and bar California from setting its own emissions standards or requiring electric vehicles, sources with direct knowledge of the talks said Wednesday. Last Friday, White House officials met with senior lobbyists from General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and urged them to back the Trump administration’s effort. Last month, the White House said it had ended talks with California aimed at trying to reach a consensus on fuel efficiency requirements. The administration said in August its preferred plan was to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026. Administration officials told automakers last month they hope to finalize the proposal released by the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration by May or June. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.  GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said the company “appreciates the administration’s efforts to continue dialogue with automakers. At the meeting General Motors stressed the importance for one national program as well as our commitment to an all-electric future.” Ford and Fiat Chrysler declined to comment. Some administration officials have suggested the White House could abandon the effort to freeze the Obama rules if automakers are not supportive, but others are skeptical the administration would drop one of its most important deregulatory measures. At least one automaker at the meeting urged the White House to reopen talks with California, but administration officials said they did not plan to do so. In February, the administration held a call with a wider group of automakers and urged them to side with the administration rather than California. Automakers have publicly stated they do not back a freeze but think the requirements should rise but be reduced to account for changes in oil prices and consumer demand. According to people briefed on the meeting, some of the auto officials expressed some support for preempting California’s rules, but to date no automaker has publicly endorsed the idea. Some administration officials have questioned why automakers have not been more supportive of eliminating significant regulatory costs. California Air Resource Board chief Mary Nichols said last month the Trump administration decided “to put an end to any effort to find common ground - but it is a signal to us to stand our ground.”     Automakers worry that without a deal, they will face potentially years of uncertainty as lawsuits leave them unclear on what requirements they will need to meet. A group of 20 U.S. states and several major cities has already promised to sue and called the Trump administration proposal “unlawful” and “reckless.”  Another White House meeting is planned for this month with regulators to discuss how the administration should move forward. Some automakers are also pushing the Trump administration to leave in place or boost credits for building electric vehicles, but some administration officials do not like credits because they think it unfairly gives certain vehicles advantages over others.

1027,U.S. Democrats unveil legislation to reinstate net neutrality rules - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  3:51 PM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress unveiled a bill on Wednesday to reinstate net neutrality rules repealed by the Federal Communications Commission under U.S. President Donald Trump, the latest salvo in a more than decade-long battle over how to regulate internet traffic.  The bill mirrors an effort last year to reverse the FCC’s December 2017 order repealing landmark rules approved in 2015 that barred internet providers from blocking or slowing content or offering paid “fast lanes.” “It is a fight that we can win,” said Senator Ed Markey, a bill sponsor, at a Capitol Hill news conference. “We are on the right side of history. We will not give up.” He said the bill, dubbed the “Save the Internet Act,” will protect consumers from higher prices, blocked websites or slower internet speeds. The reversal of net neutrality rules was a win for internet providers like Comcast Corp, AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc, but opposed by content and social media companies like Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc. The bill would repeal the order introduced by FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, bar the FCC from reinstating it or a substantially similar order and reinstate the 2015 net neutrality order, a fact sheet said. Pai said in a statement that the 2017 rule “has proven wrong the many hysterical predictions of doom ... most notably the fantasy that market-based regulation would bring about ‘the end of the Internet as we know it.’”  He suggested that the main thing the internet needs to be saved from is “heavy-handed regulation from the 1930s” that would treat it as a public utility. Markey said the bill has the support of nearly all Democrats, and a companion bill will be introduced in the House of Representatives on Friday. Democrats say they expect the House will vote on the bill in the next few months. Republicans oppose reinstating the 2015 rules that grant the FCC sweeping authority to oversee the conduct of internet providers.  House Republicans Greg Walden, Bob Latta and Cathy McMorris Rodgers said in a statement that both parties believe “a free and open internet is fundamental to our society.” “All sides want a permanent solution,” they said.  Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the FCC ignored the will of the American people in repealing the rules.  The Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, voted in May 2018 to reinstate the rules, but the House did not take up the issue before Congress adjourned last year.  A U.S. federal appeals court last month held lengthy oral arguments in a legal challenge to the FCC’s decision. That court upheld the Obama internet rules in 2016. In its 2017 decision, the Republican-led FCC voted 3-2 along party lines. The agency gave providers sweeping power to recast how users access the internet but said they must disclose changes in internet access.

1028,Ready to inhale: Democratic 2020 contenders embrace marijuana legalization - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  11:03 AM / 2 months ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cory Booker has reintroduced his U.S. Senate bill to legalize marijuana at the federal level. Beto O’Rourke called for expunging the records of those arrested for possession of the drug. Kamala Harris admitted she had smoked pot - and inhaled. When it comes to legalizing marijuana, many of the current and potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are eager to show they are cool with cannabis. Their embrace of the issue reflects a rapid shift in public opinion that has brought what was once an extreme political position into the mainstream. A Gallup poll in October found two of every three Americans support legalization, a record high, and for the first time a slim majority of Republicans support legal marijuana. Three of every four Democrats back legalization. Ten states and the District of Columbia now allow legal recreational use and more than 30 states have legalized it for medical use. “The Democratic candidates are just acknowledging the practical and political reality - this is not only good policy, it’s good politics,” said Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Booker has led the charge, reintroducing his Senate bill last week for federal legalization. Four fellow senators and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are co-sponsors: Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The other declared White House candidate in the Senate, Amy Klobuchar, has not co-sponsored Booker’s bill but said in a statement she supported legalization. Most other contenders also have taken public stands in support of some degree of legalization, with many linking the issue to criminal justice reform and protesting that racial minorities are disproportionately arrested for possession and hit with harsh sentences. “We should end the federal prohibition on marijuana and expunge the records of those who were locked away for possessing it, ensuring that they can get work, finish their education, contribute to the greatness of this country,” O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who is expected to announce soon whether he will run, said in an email to supporters on Monday. The shift in political attitudes has come quickly for presidential candidates. During his 1992 run to the White House, Democrat Bill Clinton famously said he had tried pot but “didn’t inhale.” Hillary Clinton opposed federal legalization in 2016 but supported letting states decide their own approach. Republican President Donald Trump also said during the campaign he would let states chart their own course and later undercut plans by his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to crack down on states that legalized marijuana. Harris, a former California attorney general and San Francisco prosecutor, opposed a California ballot initiative in 2010 that would have legalized marijuana. The initiative failed. But as a presidential candidate, she joked recently about smoking pot, telling a New York radio show that “I inhaled,” and adding: “Half of my family’s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?” The two governors in the Democratic race, Jay Inslee of Washington and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, are intimately familiar with the issue. Their states were the first to legalize recreational marijuana use. “It’s time for Congress to acknowledge that marijuana legalization is working in states like Washington, Colorado, and others and legalize marijuana as well,” Inslee, who plans to pardon thousands of people convicted of small-time possession charges, said on Twitter in October. Hickenlooper has been more measured, saying states should be free to legalize and the federal government should make changes to accommodate that choice such as changing federal banking laws. Sanders, during his failed 2016 Democratic primary run against Clinton, was the first high-profile presidential candidate to support federal legalization. “Too many lives are being destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of people get criminal records. You know why? Because they have smoked marijuana,” Sanders said on a radio talk show on Monday. When asked, he said he had tried marijuana. “It didn’t do a whole lot for me,” he said, adding he “nearly coughed my brains out.” Reporting by John Whitesides; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1030,"Intel puts modem business up for sale, held talks with Apple: WSJ - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  7:08 PM / in 11 days","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Intel Corp is exploring strategic options for its modem chip business, including a possible sale to Apple or another acquirer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.  Intel decided to exit the 5G modem chip business last week, hours after Apple settled a longstanding legal dispute with Qualcomm Inc, a key supplier of iPhone modem chips. Apple had held talks with Intel around last summer and continued to do so for months until halting recently around the time of its settlement with Qualcomm, the WSJ report said. Intel has already received expressions of interest from a number of parties and has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc to manage the process, which was in an early stage, the report said.  Apple, Intel and Goldman Sachs declined to a request from Reuters for comment. Shares of Apple closed at $204.3, down 0.53 percent. Shares of Intel which were down as much as 11 percent on Friday afternoon after it cut its full-year revenue outlook yesterday, pared losses to close at $52.43, down about 9 percent.

1032,"Slack is loss-making but revenue continues to grow, filing shows - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  1:19 PM / 11 days ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - The owner of popular workplace instant messaging app Slack made public strong year-on-year growth numbers on Friday, and an annual loss of $140.7 million, as it filed formally for its long-awaited market debut. The San Francisco-based company, Slack Technologies, seeking to go public via a direct listing similar to that of music streaming app Spotify last year, published numbers showing it had more than 10 million daily active users as of the end of January. Paying customers or organizations numbered 88,000, up almost 50 percent from a year earlier and more than double the 37,000 it had in 2017, the company’s regulatory filing showed. Big customers that pay Slack at least $100,000 a year numbered 575 as of year ended January, up from 298 in the previous year. These customers accounted for about 40 percent of its total revenue in fiscal 2019 and no one paid customer accounted for more than three percent. The company said it had more than 500,000 organizations on its free subscription plan and that revenue jumped 82 percent from last year to $400.6 million and up from $105 million in 2017.  Reuters had previously reported that the company was hoping for a valuation of more than $10 billion in the listing, which should now happen within weeks.  Some early investors and employees have been selling the stock at around $28, valuing the company close to $17 billion, Kelly Rodriques, Chief Executive Officer of Forge, a brokerage company, told CNBC on Thursday. The company’s big issue, like many startups, is costs. Total operating expenses rose 49 percent to $503.5 million in fiscal 2019, the company said, largely due to higher sales and marketing costs. “The company is a classic tech company with scalability,” said Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and professor at the University of Florida. “There is the potential for profitability in the next few years, with rapidly growing profits after that.”  “Many tech companies, such as Dropbox and Spotify, offer free use to people or organizations, with the idea that a certain fraction of them will become heavy users and paying customers. As long as the churn rate is not too high, this can be a successful business strategy.” The company, which expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SK”, reported a loss of $181 million a year earlier. Slack’s biggest shareholders include Accel Partners, an investor in Facebook and Dropbox, which holds 24 percent, followed by Andreessen Horowitz, with 13.3 percent. Japanese conglomerate SoftBank owns 7.3 percent. The company, whose competitors include Microsoft Teams, a free chat add-on for Microsoft’s Office365 users, said it expects to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. The company, which was launched in 2013, counts Trivago, BBC, Lyft, 21st Century Fox, Shopify, and Survey Monkey as its customers. This year has already seen a run of technology sector IPOs, with Lyft Inc, Pinterest and Zoom Video Communications launching to various degrees of success. Uber Technologies Inc unveiled the terms of its IPO on Friday, seeking a $91.5 billion valuation in what could prove the year’s biggest launch.

1036,"J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley see U.S. Fed may cut interest on reserves next week - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  4:31 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may lower the interest it pays on excess reserves banks leave with it by 5 basis points at its April 30-May 1 policy meeting in a bid to prevent the federal funds rate from drifting higher, two primary dealers said on Friday. The fed funds rate has been running consistently above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) since mid-March, fanning worries excess bank reserves are scarce, which would drive up short-term borrowing costs broadly. On Thursday, the average or effective fed funds rate (EFFR) stood at 2.44%, 4 basis points above the current IOER level. “We believe the move higher in EFFR comes as a surprise to the Fed and most market participants since there has been a belief that at current reserve levels EFFR is likely to remain sticky close to IOER,” Morgan Stanley strategists Matthew Hornbach and Sam Elprince wrote in a research note. If the Fed reduces the IOER spread to the lower end of its target range on interest rates, it would mark the third such “technical” adjustment on the interest on excess reserves (IOER) following cuts last June and December. “If the funds rate continues to trade near recent levels, we think there’s about one-in-three chance they make another 5 (basis points) technical adjustment to the IOER rate,” J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among 23 Wall Street firms that do business directly with the Fed.

1037,Soft U.S. inflation data gives dollar rally pause - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  12:25 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on Friday, snapping a three-day streak of gains, after an overall strong U.S. first-quarter growth report was overshadowed by soft inflation data. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, released on Friday, versus the 2.0 percent estimated by economists polled by Reuters. The dollar, however, did not enjoy a boost from the report as traders focused on the core personal expenditures consumption price index figure, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, which increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. “Overall, U.S. growth last quarter was outstanding. But the soft inflation components were enough to spur some profit-taking in the buck’s winning week,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. “Once the dust settles, the focus should shift back to the bullish U.S. growth theme which has been resoundingly positive for the dollar,” said Manimbo. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, was 0.2% lower at 98.009. The index, which hit a 23-month high earlier in the session, is up 0.7% for the week. Recent U.S. data has been supportive of the greenback and reinforced the belief that the United States is on a firmer economic footing than other leading economies. “There were plenty of positive headlines for the U.S. economy this week, with GDP growth accelerating in the first quarter, durable goods orders surging in March, and the S&P 500 hitting a record high,” Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “But signs of underlying weakness abound which, together with the renewed softness of core inflation, will keep the Fed sounding extremely dovish next week,” said Pearce. The Fed, set to meet for two days next week, recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any interest rate hikes this year.    The euro, which is hovering near its weakest level against the dollar since May 2017 amid worries about the strength of the euro zone economy, was up 0.19% at $1.1151, ahead of a national election in Spain on Sunday. The British pound, up 0.19% on Friday, was headed to finish the week down 0.5%, dragged down by growing concern about stagnant talks around Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit.

1038,U.S. SEC extends compliance date for revised order-handling rule - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  7:26 PM / 10 days ago","2 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision has given broker-dealers more time to comply with amendments to a rule that increases transparency around how they handle their customers’ stock orders, according to a recent regulatory filing. The extension of the compliance date for amendments to the SEC rule, known as Rule 606, to Oct. 1 from May 20, was made to give broker dealers enough time to make changes to their electronic order-routing systems and test them for compliance, the April 24 filing said.  “The Commission believes that an extension of the compliance date for the recently adopted amendments to Rule 606 is reasonable to provide broker-dealers with adequate time to implement fully the systems and other changes necessary to comply with amended Rule 606,” the SEC said. The regulator acknowledged that the extension of the compliance date would delay the ability of investors to better compare and monitor broker-dealers’ order-routing practices.          The SEC voted to amend its 18-year-old order-handling rule on Nov. 2 to make it easier for investors to evaluate how brokers handle their orders, including more details around payments the brokers receive for sending orders to certain exchanges or private trading venues.   The amendments will give institutional investors a better idea of how their order executions are impacted by their brokers’ order-routing decisions, shedding more light on potential conflicts of interest in the process.  The information available through the current Rule 606 quarterly reports describing payment for order flow and profit-sharing arrangements will increase once the amendments kick in.  A bigger change in the amended rule is that brokers will be required to collect substantially more information on order routing and provide clients that request it with a report on an order-by-order basis detailing how their orders were handled during the prior six months.

1039,Conservatives target Ocasio-Cortez's 'Green New Deal' in New York billboards - Reuters,"March 6, 2019 /  12:34 AM / 2 months ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - A pro-business group unveiled two billboards targeting Democratic congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York City on Tuesday, criticizing her proposal for a “Green New Deal” aimed at building a renewable energy economy. The digital billboards on the side of a skyscraper in Manhattan’s Times Square are the latest broadside against the 29-year-old liberal known as “AOC,” by the Job Creators Network, founded by billionaire Bernard Marcus, a former chief executive of Home Depot Inc. Representative Ocasio-Cortez, whose district includes parts of the New York City boroughs of the Bronx and Queens, has sought to push her party to the left on environmental and economic issues. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November in an upset victory over a more mainstream Democratic incumbent. Ocasio-Cortez had opposed Amazon.com Inc’s plan to create a major New York outpost with nearly $3 billion in city and state incentives. When the company last month scrapped plans to build in New York, she called it a big victory for progressive politicians. Last month, she teamed up with U.S. Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, to lay out a plan to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within a decade with government-led investments in clean energy and infrastructure. “Hey AOC, you’re the ‘boss’?” read one billboard. “WE DON’T THINK SO. The American PEOPLE are the boss,” said the other sign, with a link to a website critical of the “Green New Deal.” In the last two weeks, the Job Creators Network has erected seven billboards in Times Square aimed at Ocasio-Cortez and her policies, a spokeswoman for the group, Elaine Parker, said in an email. The group has called the “Green New Deal” an unrealistic and potentially ruinous plan for the U.S. economy that would require massive government spending.  A representative for Ocasio-Cortez did not return emails seeking comment on the billboards. Last month, Ocasio-Cortez said in a message on Twitter that the billboard campaign demonstrated that her fight against “dark money & anti-worker policies” was gaining traction.

1040,House panel taps veteran prosecutor to lead Trump probe - Reuters,"March 5, 2019 /  6:48 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min Read(Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee said on Tuesday it had hired a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan with experience investigating Russian mobsters and white-collar crime to lead its probe into the Trump administration. The hiring of Daniel Goldman is the latest move by the House’s new Democratic majority to add legal firepower to an expanding list of investigations into the affairs of Republican President Donald Trump and his associates. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler, recently announced that he had retained Barry Berke, a prominent criminal trial lawyer, and Norman Eisen, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, to work on his expansive probe into Trump and other issues. Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, announced that Goldman joined the panel in February as senior adviser and director of investigations. Schiff also named a new budget director and three other people for various roles. Goldman, who until recently was a frequent TV commentator on the special counsel’s Russia investigation, said he was “excited” to join the committee’s probe.  “Under Chairman Schiff’s leadership, we intend to run a professional investigation designed to uncover the facts and the truth,” Goldman said in an emailed statement.  The committee’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign has taken on new life since the Democrats took control of the House in November elections. The panel is set to hear testimony from Michael Cohen, the president’s onetime “fixer,” for a second time on Wednesday since he turned on his former boss. Goldman was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York for a decade through 2017, serving as the lead prosecutor in the conviction of Las Vegas sports gambler William “Billy” Walters for insider trading. But likely more relevant to the committee’s probe is Goldman’s tenure as deputy of the Southern District’s Organized Crime Unit, where he oversaw a major Russian mob case against more than 30 individuals for money laundering and racketeering. Goldman had been working as a legal analyst for NBC News and MSNBC, commenting on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month-old investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. A spokeswoman for MSNBC confirmed Goldman was no longer an analyst for either network. Goldman attended last summer’s trial of former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort and was at the December sentencing of Cohen, who is due to start a three-year sentence in May for violating campaign finance laws and other crimes. In other recent hires by the Democrats, the House Financial Services Committee enlisted the help of Bob Roach, a longtime investigator of complex financial and money laundering issues for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Moscow, and has called the Mueller probe a “witch hunt.” Reporting by Nathan Layne and Mark Hosenball in Washington; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Tom BrownAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1041,"U.S. senators offer North Korea sanctions bill, backed by Warmbier parents - Reuters","March 5, 2019 /  9:56 PM / in 2 months","2 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators sought to dial up pressure on North Korea on Tuesday by reintroducing a bill to impose sanctions on any bank that does business with its government, with the endorsement of the parents of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student who died after being imprisoned by Pyongyang. Republican Senator Pat Toomey and Democrat Chris Van Hollen offered the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act” days after a summit between Republican President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was abruptly cut off after they failed to reach a deal for the reclusive communist nation to give up its nuclear weapons. After the summit, Trump said he believed Kim’s claim not to have known how Otto Warmbier was treated, prompting his parents to issue a sharp statement strongly condemning Kim’s “evil regime” and blaming it for their son’s death. In a statement, Fred and Cindy Warmbier thanked van Hollen and Toomey, and said they believed the legislation would provide useful tools to help change North Korea. “We continue to support the bill and appreciate them honoring our son’s memory,” the Warmbiers said. The measure, which would deny access to the U.S. banking system to any foreign bank that does business with North Korea,  unanimously passed the Senate Banking Committee last year but did not advance further. To become law, it would need to pass the full Senate and House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump.

1042,"US STOCKS-Wall St nudges up after weak Intel results, mixed GDP report - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  7:19 PM / 11 days ago","5 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * First-quarter GDP increases at 3.2 pct rate * Ford jumps after Q1 profit, revenue beat estimates * Energy sector falls with oil, Exxon misses estimates * Indexes up: Dow 0.04%, S&P 0.20%, Nasdaq 0.1% (Updates to late afternoon, adds commentary, changes byline, adds New York dataline) By Sinéad Carew New York, April 26 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s three major indexes rose slightly on Friday as Intel’s weak results put the techology sector under pressure and the energy index tumbled along with the price of oil and mixed first-quarter GDP data gave investors some pause. Dragging down the three main indexes was Intel Corp, which slumped 10.4% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed the sales estimate for its key data center business in its quarterly report late Thursday. “We’re not going to move signfiantly higher until we have clarity on the current earnings situation,” said Michael Geraghty market strategist at Cornerstone Capital in New York. “Can earnings estimates improve enough to support higher stock prices without further price to earnings multiple expansion.” Before the market open, U.S. Commerce Department data showed gross domestic product rising faster than expected due to high inventories while consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and homebuilding investment contracted for a fifth straight quarter. “We had a pretty big beat on GDP today, but some underlying numbers are giving investors a pause on where they see future growth coming from given the consumer spending levels,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial. “Earnings have largely been good, but there have been some misses, which investors are trying to make sense of and that’s why we have this sideways move in markets.” At 3:00 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.3 points, or 0.04%, at 26,471.38, the S&P 500 had gained 5.75 points, or 0.20%, to 2,931.92 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.29 points, or 0.1%, to 8,126.97. Out of the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors, energy was the biggest percentage loser with a 1.7% drop as oil prices sank more than 3 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump again pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. Also, shares in oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp fell 3% after its quarterly profit missed estimates. The S&P’s heavy weight technology index was the biggest drag on the benchmark, with a 0.6% decline Despite weakness in some big companies more than three-quarters of the 229 S&P 500 companies, which have reported so far, have topped earnings estimate, according to Refinitiv data. The consensus forecast for the S&P 500 dipped again to a 0.3% year-over-year decline after turning flat earlier in the week. Still it was an improvement on the 2.3% drop estimated at the start of the quarter. Improving confidence in earnings had helped push the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high, reached in September. Stocks have rallied this year on hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution and a turnaround in the Federal Reserve’s stance to abandon further interest rate hikes this year. The S&P’s biggest boost on Friday was from the consumer discretionary sector, which rose 0.8%. Offering support was Amazon.com Inc, which rose 2.4% after the e-commerce giant’s quarterly profit doubled and beat Wall Street estimates though its second quarter guidance was lower than expectations. Also Ford Motor Co surged 10.5% and was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Walt Disney Co rose 1.6% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle “Avengers: Endgame” hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.86-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 34 new lows.

1043,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks rise slightly but dollar eases in wake of U.S. GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  7:04 PM / 11 days ago","3 Min Read* MSCI global stock index edges higher * U.S. GDP increases at a 3.2% annualized rate * Oil drops (Updates with oil closing prices) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Global stock markets edged higher on Friday as data showing U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter offset corporate earnings disappointments, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate. The jump in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. The dollar index fell 0.24%. The index, which hit a 23-month high earlier in the session, is up for the week. “Overall, U.S. growth last quarter was outstanding. But the soft inflation components were enough to spur some profit-taking in the buck’s winning week,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. Also limiting gains in stocks were tech shares, with Intel Corp down sharply after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Exxon Mobil and Chevron also were lower following results Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.32 points, or 0.07%, to 26,479.4, the S&P 500 gained 5.22 points, or 0.18%, to 2,931.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.39 points, or 0.03%, to 8,121.07. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.22% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18%. The GDP release sets the stage for a Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, when investors will try to anticipate how the U.S. central bank will react to mostly resilient indicators of late. The rebound has not been mirrored in inflation, which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish. Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year. The Fed next week is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts published on Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 2.509%, from 2.534% late on Thursday. Oil prices sank after U.S. President Donald Trump again pressured the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise crude production to ease gasoline prices. U.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to settle at $63.30 a barrel. Brent crude futures settled down nearly 3% at $72.15. Additional reporting by Sruthi Shankar and Amy Caren Daniel in

1044,"Intel puts modem business up for sale, held talks with Apple - WSJ - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  7:01 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadApril 26 (Reuters) - Intel Corp is exploring strategic options for its modem chip business, including a possible sale to Apple or another acquirer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Intel decided to exit the 5G modem chip business last week, hours after Apple settled a longstanding legal dispute with Qualcomm Inc, a key supplier of iPhone modem chips. Apple had held talks with Intel around last summer and continued to do so for months until halting recently around the time of its settlment with Qualcomm, the WSJ report here said. Intel has already received expressions of interest from a number of parties and has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc to manage the process, which was in an early stage, the report said. Apple, Intel and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shares of Intel which were down as much as 11 percent on Friday afternoon after it cut its full-year revenue outlook yesterday, pared some losses to trade down 10.03 percent at $51.83.

1045,Proxy adviser ISS recommends against three directors at Sturm Ruger - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  2:45 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadBOSTON (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services recommended investors withhold support from three directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co ahead of its May 8 annual meeting, the top proxy adviser said in a report seen by Reuters on Friday. Sturm Ruger has been under pressure from gun control activists over how it might respond to a series of mass shootings across the United States, including at schools, houses of worship and workplaces. ISS recommended investors withhold support from Sturm Ruger Chair Michael Jacobi and the heads of its governance and risk oversight committees. It did recommend investors back the company’s six other board nominees including Chief Executive Christopher Killoy and Sandra Froman, who is also a director of the National Rifle Association and was its president from 2005 to 2007. In a separate report, rival proxy adviser Glass Lewis recommended support for all nine of Sturm Ruger’s director nominees. Last year a majority of Sturm Ruger investors backed a call for a safety report, but ISS said the document the company produced “provides little new information.” ISS also wrote that contrary to the board’s policy of non-engagement with investors, many U.S. companies routinely engage with their shareholders. Sturm Ruger general counsel Kevin Reid said via e-mail, “We are disappointed with the ISS report and strongly disagree with the withhold recommendations.”  He said the company is confident the 34-page report it issued Feb. 8 “was fully responsive to the shareholder proposal” passed last year and said investors should read it and judge for themselves, via the firm’s website.

1046,Husky Energy and Imperial Oil urge Alberta to end oil curbs - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  11:15 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min ReadWINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Two of Canada’s biggest integrated oil producers on Friday urged the incoming Alberta government to end mandatory production cuts, saying they have hurt the economy and deterred investment in the country’s main crude-producing province. Alberta imposed the curtailments in January in an attempt to reduce hefty price discounts on Canadian crude that reflected production that far exceeded pipeline space.  Imperial Oil Ltd and Husky Energy previously benefited from refining cheaper oil, and opposed the cuts. “Alberta needs to take concrete measures to rebuild investor confidence,” Husky Chief Executive Rob Peabody said on a conference call. “We have a new government and we urge them to return to competitive free market principles by ending quotas and allowing the market to manage itself in a more natural and efficient manner.”  Alberta’s new Premier Jason Kenney, leader of the United Conservative Party government, will be sworn in next week. Curtailments have resulted in producers shutting in output that would otherwise be profitable, and caused job losses for companies that provide services such as drilling, Peabody said. He added that it is unclear whether the curtailments have meaningfully reduced a glut of oil in storage. Imperial CEO Rich Kruger said the only positive from curtailments was higher crude prices. The intervention had also removed the incentive for crude-by-rail shipments, which in turn meant oil inventories remained high, eroded investor confidence and deterred traders from making longer-term bets on Canadian crude prices, he said. “One out of five (measures) is up, the other four are down,” Kruger told shareholders at Imperial’s annual general meeting. “I am a big sports fan, particularly baseball. If I batted one out of five, I’d be on a long bus ride to the minor leagues.” Kruger estimated curtailments had cost Imperial C$250 million ($185.8 million) relative to the fourth quarter of 2018. The company’s income nearly halved in the first quarter due to extreme cold weather, production cuts and weak refining margins. Husky beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit as it benefited from improved prices even as production fell. The CEO of integrated producer Suncor Energy also advised the incoming government to find a managed way to exit curtailments in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. Rival Cenovus Energy offered a different view on Wednesday, when CEO Alex Pourbaix praised the cuts for improving Canadian prices, allowing that company to return to quarterly profit.   Imperial shares fell 1.6 percent, while Husky stock rose 0.2 percent in Toronto.

1047,PRECIOUS-Gold scales near 2-week peak as dollar dips after U.S. GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  4:24 PM / in 11 days","3 Min Read* Bullion up about 1 pct so far this week * Spot gold neutral in $1,274-$1,284 range -analyst * Palladium jumps 3 pct to one-month high (Updates prices) By Brijesh Patel April 26 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a near two-week high on Friday, as the dollar slipped on tepid U.S. inflation data, outweighing an overall strong first-quarter growth report. Spot gold gained 0.7 percent to $1,286.41 per ounce as of 2:16 p.m. EDT (1816 GMT), after hitting its highest level since April 16, at $1,288.59. The metal, which on Tuesday touched its lowest level since late December, at $1,265.90, is up nearly 1 percent so far this week and is poised for its first weekly gain since March 22. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7 percent higher at $1,288.80 an ounce. “The main reason is the fact that the dollar is pulling lower today,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures. But, he said, “We have to be cautious about this move. It looks like a false positive because I expect equities to continue to be strong next week, pressuring the precious metals.” The dollar index fell, making gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, after the U.S. first-quarter report on growth in gross domestic product, which was strong overall, was overshadowed by the soft inflation data. The core personal expenditures consumption price index figure, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. “Also, there seems to be a bit of short covering as we are heading into the weekend and some technical buying,” said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst with Kitco metals. But even strong data out of the United States was unlikely to change the Federal Reserve’s monetary strategy, analysts said. According to a Reuters poll, major central banks are done tightening policy as the global growth outlook has softened across developed and emerging economies, with scant prospects for a surge in inflation. “Despite a signiﬁcant drop in long-term real rates, gold prices have remained ﬂat year-to-date as recession fears have receded since late last year,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. Central bank gold purchases have been running strong this year, which could support prices, Goldman said. While gold has fallen more than 4 percent from a peak in February, bullion’s recovery from this week’s four-month low is painting a neutral picture in technical charts. Gold looks neutral in a $1,274-$1,284 range, and an escape could suggest a direction, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver rose 0.7 percent to $15.04 per ounce, while platinum was up 1.7 percent to $897.25. Palladium advanced 3 percent to $1,458.01 per ounce, its highest level since March 27.

1048,TREASURIES-Yields fall as weak inflation data outweigh headline GDP boom - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  6:40 PM / in 11 days","3 Min Read(Recasts, updates yields) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell following Friday’s first-quarter growth report as weak inflation data tempered the strong headline figure. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report released on Friday, versus the 2.0% estimated by economists polled by Reuters. But Federal Reserve officials are likely to shrug off the surge in growth and focus on a measure of domestic demand that excludes trade, inventories and government spending, which increased at only a 1.3% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013, after increasing at a 2.6% pace in the October-December quarter. The Fed is also likely to focus on the disappointing core personal consumption expenditure price index figure, which increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. PCE is the Fed’s preferred metric of inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next week to discuss interest rate policy. “From a Treasury perspective, the Fed is going to focus on the inflation number,” which is why yields fell, said Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI. “Offsetting the GDP growth was the GDP deflator, which was 0.9%.” The Fed recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any interest rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs four times in 2018. At present, 41.4% of traders predict that the Fed will have cut interest rates 25 basis points by the end of the year, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, while 33.7% believe rates will stay where they are, down from 41.8% on Thursday. The details of the growth figures also detracted from the headline gain: first-quarter GDP owed its outperformance to trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. “While the consumer did pull back from their torrid holiday buying in the fourth quarter, trade and inventory rebuilding added an outsized 1.7% to GDP. GDP was expected to be 2.3% and without the boost from trade and inventory, GDP would have actually missed,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors. Yields across maturities were lower, with the biggest losses at the short end of the curve. The two-year yield, a proxy for investor expectations of interest-rate hikes, was last down 3.8 basis points to 2.292%. The benchmark 10-year government note yield was last 2.5 basis points lower at 2.509%.

1049,Argentine peso ends rollercoaster week with record low close - Reuters,"April 27, 2019 /  1:47 AM / in 11 days","4 Min ReadBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s peso fell back on Friday afternoon to post a record low close, giving up earlier gains after a tumultuous week that saw the currency battered to its weakest ever level and local debt pummeled as anxious investors fled. The peso closed at 45.95 to the dollar, traders told Reuters, down around 1.85 percent on the day though still up on Thursday’s intraday low of 46.5. Markets had been somewhat salved by official interventions in the market and higher interest rates on short-term “Leliq” notes, they said. Argentine bonds and the peso have been hammered this week as uncertainty over a biting recession and high inflation frayed investor nerves about political upheaval in Latin America’s No. 3 economy ahead of elections in October. “Investors will remain worried until you see the elections happen. Unfortunately that’s a recipe for further volatility,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, New York-based senior emerging markets strategist at Standard Chartered Bank. He said President Mauricio Macri still had a decent chance of re-election, the country was in better shape than in the past to counter the crisis, and that inflation should gradually slow. However, investors would demand high returns to stay in the market given the risks, he added. The yield of Argentine government bonds due in 2021 have shot up above 18 percent and credit default swaps (CDS) of Argentine five-year debt rose to 1,229.25 points, a reflection of a rising chance of default. The turmoil has raised the heat on Macri after a week in which domestic media ran blanket coverage about a renewed crisis, threatening to derail his plans for re-election and bolstering his political rivals. The recession-hit country spiraled into a currency crisis last year that forced Macri to take a $56 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund. In 2018 the peso lost half its value against the dollar and inflation was close to 50 percent. The peso fell 2.48 percent on Thursday after a 3.53 percent slide the day before. It was down 8.81 percent for the week. Most economists said the market turmoil had been linked to a poll earlier in the week that suggested Macri’s arch rival, populist ex-President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, could beat the pro-market leader in an election run-off.  Macri defended the government’s economic reforms on Thursday, saying they had established an independent central bank and a balanced budget. He added change took time and volatility was to be expected. “The markets are different, they are types who are behind a computer in a faraway place, who buy, sell and have a short-term, opportunistic vision,” he said in comments made to local radio and circulated by his office. “There is a huge majority of Argentines who do not want to go backwards and who want to go into the future.” Macri’s fortunes are likely to rest on what happens in the economy in coming months, including whether he is successful in bringing down inflation that was 4.7 percent in March and is running at a 12-month rate of close to 55 percent - driving investors out of the peso. Morgan Stanley said in a research note it thought the market price of the peso was “too pessimistic,” but it preferred to “wait on the sidelines” given the stubbornly high inflation and  hard-to-call election race. That may leave little upside for the peso. “With inflation continuing to rise and the domestic economy still suffering it is hard to paint a picture where ARS (Argentine peso) rallies significantly,” Rabobank strategist Christian Lawrence said in written comments. “The elections are of course key but there are concerns that Macri is essentially trying to fight ‘kirch with kirch’ by adopting populist policies in an attempt to woo voters tempted to return to the days of pre-Macri.” Reporting by Walter Bianchi, Adam Jourdan and Gabriel Burin; Editing by Chris Reese and Rosalba O'BrienAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1050,Russia to restore oil pipeline supplies to Europe in two weeks - Reuters,"April 24, 2019 /  10:33 PM / 11 days ago","4 Min ReadMINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to restore oil supplies via its key Druzhba pipeline to Europe in two weeks, after joint talks with Belarus, Ukraine and Poland on Friday in Minsk.  Poland, Germany, Ukraine and other countries suspended imports of Russian oil via the pipeline this week due to contamination. Halting those supplies has knock-on effects further along the network. After joint talks in the Belarus capital on Friday, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak said in a statement that the four countries had agreed on joint measures to eliminate the effects of the contamination.  “This would allow us, as earlier planned, to supply... (clean) oil to the border with Belarus by April 29 and to restore the pipeline (to stability) in two weeks,” Kozak said in the statement on Friday.  Pavel Sorokin, Russia’s deputy energy minister, told reporters in Minsk after the talks that one of the options for supplying clean oil was to mix the contaminated product with regular supply. Russia’s pipeline monopoly Transneft said on Friday that the contamination which led to the suspension of the oil flows to Europe could be deliberate, Interfax news agency reported. The problem arose last week when an unidentified Russian producer contaminated oil with high levels of organic chloride, which is typically used to boost oil output but which must be separated before shipment as it can destroy refining equipment. “A criminal case was opened over an intended contamination of Russian oil,” Transneft spokesman, Igor Dyomin, was quoted as saying by Interfax. The pollution was detected at the private Samara Transneft-terminal, where oil is being supplied to the system, according to Transneft’s Dyomin. He said the terminal receives crude oil from a number of small producers.  Dyomin did not name the producers but said investigators were making searches at a number of private companies in the Volga town of Samara. Reuters could not reach the Samara Transneft-terminal via telephone due to the late hour. Ukrtransnafta suspended the transit of oil through the pipeline on Thursday, closing supplies via Druzhba’s southern route to Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary.  The suspension cut off a major supply route for Polish refineries owned by Poland’s PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos, as well as plants in Germany owned by Total, Shell, Eni and Rosneft. The pipeline issue, which has supported global oil prices, lifted Russian Urals crude differentials to an all-time high on Thursday.  With pipeline supplies to Europe shut, Russia faces a challenge of how to divert about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) that was meant to be shipped through the network to other destinations at a time when export capacity is at its limits. State-run Russian Railways held talks with domestic companies on using up to 5,000 rail tankers to transport crude, the RIA news agency reported on Friday.  Concerns about the quality of Urals crude also caused delays in loadings at the Baltic port of Ust-Luga, resulting in a brief shutdown on Wednesday and Thursday. A port official and traders said on Friday loadings had resumed. Russian loading plans indicate it aims to boost Urals exports in May before the expiry of a deal on output cuts agreed with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, Reuters calculations and Energy Ministry data show. Russian deputy prime minister Kozak, who is in charge of government energy policy, said this week that those found responsible for contaminating the oil could be fined. He did not provide names.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product rose at a 3.2 percent annualized rate, boosted by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015 - temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. The report also showed consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter, giving it a weak tone. “We had a pretty big beat on GDP today, but some underlying numbers are giving investors a pause on where they see future growth coming from given the consumer spending levels,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial. “Earnings have largely been good, but there have been some misses, which investors are trying to make sense of and that’s why we have this sideways move in markets.” Dragging down the three main indexes was Intel Corp , which slumped 10.4% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Semiconductor stocks took a beating, with the Philadelphia chip index falling 1.52%, while the broader technology sector declined 0.67%. Exxon Mobil Corp was down 2.7% as the company’s quarterly profit missed estimates on lower oil and gas prices and weakness across its businesses. Despite weak results from some marquee names, more than three-quarters of the 229 S&P 500 companies, which have reported so far, have topped earnings estimate, according to Refinitiv data. The forecast for earnings growth has also improved to a 0.3% decline from a 2.3% drop estimated at the start of the quarter. That, in part, has put the S&P 500 closer to an all-time high and pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Wednesday. Stocks have rallied this year on hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution and a turnaround in the Federal Reserve’s stance to abandon further interest rate hikes this year. At 12:48 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.56 points, or 0.05%, at 26,474.64, the S&P 500 was up 3.57 points, or 0.12%, at 2,929.74 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 4.37 points, or 0.05%, at 8,114.31. Offering support to markets was Amazon.com Inc, which rose 1.3% after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services. Walt Disney Co rose 1.3% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle “Avengers: Endgame” hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut. Ford Motor Co surged 10.3% and was the biggest gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Their shares drove a 0.6% gain in the consumer discretionary sector. The energy sector fell 1.74%, the most among the three S&P sectors in the red, weighed down by lower crude prices and Exxon’s downbeat results. Mattel Inc jumped 4.1% after the toymaker beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue, as a more diverse range of Barbie dolls powered sales in the United States. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.99-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 33 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and 32 new lows.

1052,Factbox: More Democrats enter 2020 U.S. presidential race - Reuters,"March 1, 2019 /  9:13 PM / 2 months ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats, anxious to get started on their quest to recapture the White House in 2020, are lining up to launch campaigns in what is quickly becoming a crowded field of presidential contenders. A diverse group that includes at least six U.S. senators will be vying for the right to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, who could face a long-shot primary challenger. Here are the Democrats who have either launched campaigns or formed exploratory committees to begin raising money and hiring staff for a presidential run: CORY BOOKER - Booker, 49, a black second-term senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination. He announced his candidacy on Feb. 1, the first day of Black History Month, mentioning the impact of racial discrimination on his family and saying he would focus on creating good jobs and reforming the criminal justice system. PETE BUTTIGIEG - The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, launched a campaign to become the first openly gay president on Jan. 23 with a call for a new generation of leadership to bring fresh approaches to problems. Buttigieg, 37, brushed off questions about his experience by highlighting the economic turnaround in his city. JULIAN CASTRO - The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama joined the race onJan. 12 in his hometown of San Antonio, Texas, where he once served as mayor and a city councilman. Castro, 44, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, is so far the only Hispanic in the field. He has used his family’s personal story to criticize Trump’s border policies. JOHN DELANEY - The former U.S. representative from Maryland was the first Democrat to enter the race in July 2017, long before most candidates began making their moves. Delaney, 55, has focused heavily on campaigning and organizing in Iowa, the state that will kick off the nominating fight in February 2020,making repeated trips there and visiting all 99 counties. TULSI GABBARD - Gabbard, 37, the first Hindu to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, announced she would run on Jan.11. Her campaign quickly became engulfed in controversy over her past anti-gay activism and statements, and the Hawaii congresswoman was forced to apologize. “In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong,” she said. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND - An outspoken leader in the #MeToomovement against sexual assault and harassment, the senator from New York announced her candidacy on Jan. 15 on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Gillibrand, 52, touted her rural roots in upstate New York on a subsequent trip to Iowa and said she had proven her ability to win over more conservative rural voters. KAMALA HARRIS - She announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr. The daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters. The 54-year-old, first-term senator from California reported raising $1.5 million online in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall. JOHN HICKENLOOPER - The 67-year-old former Colorado governor has positioned himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder with business experience. During his two terms in office, Colorado’s economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana. The former geologist and brew pub owner is one of two governors in the race and so far has refused to take corporate money for his political action committee. JAY INSLEE - The Washington state governor entered the field on March 1 with a vow to make climate change a central issue. Inslee, 68, has made protecting the environment a key fixture of his administration. He has moved to put a moratorium on capital punishment and fully implement the Affordable Care Act and accompanying expansion of Medicaid health coverage for the poor. He spent 15 years in Congress before being elected governor in 2012. AMY KLOBUCHAR - She was the first moderate in the field vying to challenge Trump. Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings on his Supreme Court nomination. Now in her third six-year term as a senator for Minnesota, Klobuchar’s campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists. BERNIE SANDERS - The Vermont senator, 77, lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hilary Clinton. Sanders drew strong backing from younger voters who supported his proposals for free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare, ideas he plans to reprise as he vies for the 2020 nomination. The campaign reported raising $10 million in the first week of his run. ELIZABETH WARREN - The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts, a leader of the party’s liberals and fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, jumped into the race with a New Year’s Eve video release. On visits to states that hold early nominating contests such as Iowa and New Hampshire, she has focused on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy.

1053,"Whitaker, former acting U.S. attorney general, leaves Justice Dept - Reuters","March 4, 2019 /  6:22 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Matthew Whitaker, whose brief tenure as acting U.S. attorney general was marred by accusations he might try to interfere in a probe of President Donald Trump’s campaign, left his Justice Department job over the weekend, a department spokeswoman confirmed on Monday.  Whitaker’s last day at the department was on Saturday, the spokeswoman said, adding she did not know where he might be headed next. In mid-February, Attorney General William Barr was sworn in and Whitaker stepped down from the top post to become a senior counselor in the office of the associate attorney general. In one of his final acts as acting attorney general, Whitaker testified before the House Judiciary Committee, where combative Democratic lawmakers pressed him on whether he had tried to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. Whitaker denied any interference and said he had not talked to Trump about the probe. Trump has denied colluding with Russia and has repeatedly called Mueller’s investigation a “witch hunt.” Whitaker first joined the Justice Department as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff in the autumn of 2017. Trump handpicked him as acting attorney general in November after the president ousted Sessions. Whitaker’s appointment alarmed Democrats, who pointed to numerous negative comments he had made about the probe during his previous work as a conservative political pundit. Those concerns were exacerbated after the Justice Department disclosed that its career ethics lawyers had recommended that Whitaker recuse himself from the probe to avoid the appearance of a conflict but that he declined to do so. The Justice Department also faced a backlash in the form of multiple lawsuits alleging Whitaker’s appointment violated the U.S. Constitution and the federal law governing succession at the department. None of the plaintiffs who challenged Whitaker’s appointment prevailed, and the issue has since been mooted with Barr’s Senate confirmation. Although Whitaker is no longer with the Justice Department, he could still find himself in the spotlight. Following his contentious House of Representatives testimony last month, Democrats have raised questions about whether he had been truthful in his statements under oath. In a letter to Whitaker, the panel’s chairman, Jerrold Nadler, said he wanted Whitaker to come back and follow up on answers he gave that seemed “unsatisfactory, incomplete or contradicted by other evidence.” Nadler told MSNBC that Whitaker has agreed to testify again before the committee and his appearance would happen in the next few weeks.

1054,U.S. lawmakers complain Trump has taken 'no meaningful action' on abuse of China Muslims - Reuters,"March 4, 2019 /  9:40 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers complained to the Trump administration on Monday that its response to rights abuses against China’s Muslim minority was inadequate months after it said it was looking into imposing sanctions. “This issue is bigger than just China. It is about demonstrating to strongmen globally that the world will hold them accountable for their actions,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The group is led by Eliot Engel, Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and includes Republican ranking member Representative Ted Yoho.  Pompeo wrote to the committee on Sept. 28 saying his department was looking into a request for sanctions on those responsible for abuses and for controls on exports of technology that facilitates mass detentions and surveillance of ethnic minorities in western China’s Xinjiang region, the letter said. “It appears that the Administration has taken no meaningful action ... and we write today with a renewed sense of urgency on this serious matter,” said the letter, also signed by Brad Sherman, Democratic chairman of the Asia and Pacific subcommittee, and Chris Smith, Republican ranking member of the human rights subcommittee. The U.S. ambassador for International Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback, told reporters the issue was “being discussed thoroughly within the administration,” but he had no new steps to announce. Brownback spoke at a Capitol Hill event to mark the formation of the Coalition to Advance Religious Freedom in China, a multi-faith group of over a dozen religious and rights organizations established to campaign against persecution. A spokeswoman for the State Department said it remained  “deeply disturbed that since April 2017, the Chinese government has detained more than one million Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims in internment camps.” “We will continue to call on China to end these counterproductive policies, free all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of its Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,” she said. China denies the allegations.   U.S. officials said last year the administration was considering sanctions against companies and officials linked to China’s crackdown, including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, a member of the Chinese leadership’s powerful politburo. But no action has been forthcoming, with the administration engaged in sensitive negotiations to resolve a trade war between the countries. Pompeo said on Monday he thought they were “on the cusp” of a deal to end the trade war. In a November interview with Reuters, China’s ambassador to Washington warned of retaliation if Washington were to impose sanctions on Chen. Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he hoped the lawmakers would “respect the facts” and “refrain from smears and actions that could damage the China-U.S. relationship”. “This will bring no benefit to them,” he said.      The U.S. lawmakers said it was a particular concern that U.S. firms might be contributing to the Xinjiang persecution, given commercial ties to Chinese tech companies that had profited from a surge in security spending there. They called for written responses from Pompeo as to whether the U.S. government monitored the use of U.S. technology that could be used for surveillance or detention in Xinjiang and information on any U.S. firms providing such technology. The letter highlighted a Jan. 31 Reuters report saying that Hong Kong-listed Frontier Services Group, co-founded by former U.S. military services contractor Erik Prince, had signed a deal to build a training base in Xinjiang.

1055,"Morgan Stanley sees U.S. second-quarter GDP growth at 1.1%, Goldman view 2.2% - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  3:26 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley’s economists said on Friday they expect that U.S. economic growth is running at a 1.1% annual pace in the second quarter due to a reversal of the surge in exports and inventories recorded in the first quarter. Goldman Sachs analysts marked down their estimate on U.S. gross domestic product in the current quarter, but the pace was still twice as fast as Morgan Stanley’s projection. “Our preliminary expectations for growth in the second quarter sees large drags from net exports and inventories after their contributions in 1Q,” Morgan Stanley economists wrote in a research note. U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first three months of the year, driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015, the Commerce Department said earlier Friday. Goldman analysts on Friday lowered their second-quarter GDP forecast by 0.5 percentage point to 2.2%. They said a 0.3-point drag in the first quarter from the partial government shutdown “should fully reverse” in the second quarter.

1057,U.S. economy expands 3.2 percent in first quarter; growth details weak - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  4:13 AM / 11 days ago","6 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, but the burst in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015, temporary boosters that are seen weighing on the economy later this year. The surge in growth reported by the Commerce Department on Friday put to rest fears of a recession, that were stoked by a brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March. But it also exaggerates the health of the economy as consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the government said in its advance GDP report. Growth was also driven by increased investment in roads by local and state governments. “The gain in first-quarter GDP would seem to make a mockery of claims that the U.S. economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. “Looking beyond the headline number, however, there are plenty of causes for concern.”  The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December period. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP increasing at a 2.0 percent rate in the first three months of the year. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record.  President Donald Trump cheered the economy’s performance in the first quarter. “This is far above expectations or projections,” Trump tweeted. The White House has sought to boost growth through an array of policies, including a $1.5 trillion tax cut package passed in December 2017. Economists believe the fiscal stimulus, which also included more government spending, peaked in the third quarter. They expect GDP to slow this year, with annual growth forecast around 2.5 percent, below the Trump’s administration’s 3 percent target. The economy missed the growth target in 2018. Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at only a 1.3 percent rate in the first quarter, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013. This measure of domestic demand increased at a 2.6 percent pace in the October-December quarter.  A gauge of inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve increased at a 1.3 percent rate last quarter. Fed policymakers are likely to shrug off the last quarter’s growth spurt and focus on the weak domestic demand and inflation when they meet next week. The U.S. central bank recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any interest rate increases this year. The Fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018.  “The Fed will focus on the composition of growth, which points to a slowing trend amid softening inflation,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. “This data reinforces the prudent pause the Fed is engaged in.” The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies as investors fretted over the weak details of the GDP report. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed. Exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter, leading to a small deficit that added 1.03 percentage points to GDP after being neutral in the fourth quarter. Trade tensions between the United States and China have caused wild swings in the trade deficit, with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants. The standoff has also had an impact on inventories, which increased at a $128.4 billion rate in the first quarter, the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015. Inventories increased at a $96.8 billion pace in the October-December quarter. Part of the inventory build was because of weak demand, especially in the automotive sector, which is expected to weigh on future production at factories. Inventories contributed 0.65 percentage point to first-quarter GDP after adding one-tenth of a percentage point in the October-December period.  Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.2 percent rate from the fourth quarter’s 2.5 percent rate. The moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods, likely related to a 35-day shutdown of the federal government. There was also a slowdown in spending on services. The government said the shutdown had subtracted three-tenths of a percentage point from GDP last quarter. Retail sales have since rebounded strongly, pointing to some acceleration in consumption in the second quarter. “Momentum in consumer spending picked up toward the end of the first quarter, which augurs well for a better consumption outcome in the second quarter,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “Even so ... we continue to expect GDP growth to step down to a 2.25 percent pace in second quarter.” Business spending on equipment braked sharply, rising at only at a 0.2 percent rate, the slowest since the third quarter of 2016. Spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture. Investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter. Residential construction fell at a 2.8 percent rate, marking the fifth straight quarterly decline. Government investment rebounded at a 2.4 percent rate, driven by spending at state and local governments. Federal government spending was flat.

1058,"European shares get a lift from strong earnings, U.S. GDP - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  10:16 AM / in 11 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares finished higher on Friday as some strong earnings and data showing U.S. economic growth in the first-quarter beat expectations helped cut losses from earlier in the session. The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.2 percent, led by drugmaker Sanofi and aero engine maker Safran, on upbeat earnings, while a turnaround in banks to the black after U.S. data also helped overcome the day’s losses of up to 0.9 percent.   Positive U.S. economic growth came as a relief, helping STOXX 600 post gains on the week, after dismal economic data from South Korea and Germany earlier this week had sounded alarm bells on global growth. In April, its has so far gained over 3 percent, on course to extend monthly gains to a fourth straight month.  But, STOXX 600 had briefly retraced session highs hit on the data as investors digested that the burst in growth was driven by temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters.   While most country indexes rose, London’s energy-heavy FTSE 100 ended lower as a fall in crude prices hurt oil majors. [O/R] Banks benefited with gains by HSBC, Standard Chartered and Commerzbank helping the sector index overcome earlier losses logged on disappointing results from RBS and Deutsche Bank. Healthcare, which is also seen as a defensive sector, was a bright spot. Gains of 3.5 percent by French drugmaker Sanofi after it returned to growth with higher profits and revenues for the first-quarter was the biggest boost to the pan-region index. Safran followed, up 3.4 percent, after it outpaced revenue growth plans in the first quarter. Along with positive outlook by Renault and Ford and Valeo, it took Europe’s auto sector 0.9 percent higher. Reports that Renault will propose to Nissan Motor Co a plan to create a joint holding company which would give both firms equal footing, also aided the rally in the French automaker.

1059,"TREASURIES-Yields fall on weak inflation data, shrug off GDP reading - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  4:24 PM / 11 days ago","3 Min Read(Recasts; updates yields; adds analyst quote) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell following Friday’s first-quarter growth report as weak inflation data tempered the strong headline figure. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report released on Friday, versus the 2.0% estimated by economists polled by Reuters. But Federal Reserve officials are likely to shrug off the surge in growth last quarter and focus on a measure of domestic demand that excludes trade, inventories and government spending, which increased at only a 1.3% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013, after increasing at a 2.6% pace in the October-December quarter. The Fed is also likely to focus on the disappointing core personal expenditures consumption price index figure, which increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. PCE is the Fed’s preferred metric of inflation. “From a Treasury perspective, the Fed is going to focus on the inflation number,” which is why yields fell, said Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI. “Offsetting the GDP growth was the GDP deflator, which was 0.9%.” The Fed recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any interest rate hikes this year. The U.S. central bank increased borrowing costs four times in 2018. At present, 40.9% of traders predict that the Fed will have cut interest rates by 25 basis points by the end of the year, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Yesterday, 41.8% of traders believed rates would stay where they are through December. Now, that number is 35.5%. What’s more, the higher-than-expected GDP figure owed its outperformance to trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. “While the consumer did pull back from their torrid holiday buying in the fourth quarter, trade and inventory rebuilding added an outsized 1.7% to GDP. GDP was expected to be 2.3% and without the boost from trade and inventory, GDP would have actually missed,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors. Yields across maturities were lower, with the biggest losses at the short end of the curve. The two-year yield, a proxy for investor expectations of interest-rate hikes, fell 4.4 basis points, last at 2.286%.

1061,"New Northern Ireland talks called, spurred by journalist's death - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  1:56 PM / 11 days ago","4 Min ReadBELFAST/DUBLIN (Reuters) - The British and Irish governments announced on Friday a resumption of talks to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved government, spurred into ending a hiatus in dialogue of more than a year by the killing of a journalist last week. The British-run province has been without a devolved executive for over two years since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein withdrew from the compulsory power-sharing government with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). But the shooting dead last week of 29-year-old reporter Lyra McKee during rioting by militant Irish nationalists has raised pressure on the parties from voters and the two governments to re-establish the regional government that is central to Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement. “We are leaving far too much wide open space for other kinds of voices that don’t believe in democracy, that peddle hate and fear,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told a joint news conference with his co-broker of the talks, Britain’s Northern Ireland minister Karen Bradley. “People have no patience for another show of a process or talks that go on and on and on, and then in the end go nowhere. We’ve had enough of that. It needs to be different this time.” The talks will begin on May 7 after local elections in the province with the aim of concluding well in advance of mid-July, when annual parades often raise tensions between pro-British Protestants and Irish nationalist Catholics, Coveney said. At McKee’s funeral on Wednesday, Roman Catholic priest Father Martin Magill received a spontaneous standing ovation when he made a direct appeal to the politicians in the church to use McKee’s death as a catalyst to start talking again. “There are moments in politics when things change. I think the emotion of the last week has given a spark to the process,” Coveney said. “We’d be very foolish if we allowed that time to pass.” Attempts to find a compromise have been complicated by poor relations between Sinn Fein and the DUP, the DUP’s role in propping up May’s minority government in London, and the impact on the region of Britain’s planned exit from the European Union. The talks most recently collapsed in February last year when Sinn Fein said that they had reached an accommodation with the leadership of the DUP that put an agreement within reach but that the DUP failed to close the deal and collapsed the talks. While both sides welcomed the talks, neither have shown much willingness to budge in recent days, despite the pressure. “Anyone who thinks agreement can be reached through a one-sided wish-list being implemented is not routed in reality,” DUP leader Arlene Foster, who cited Sinn Fein’s call for additional rights for Irish-language speakers as the main reason for the impasse last time, said in a statement. Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, said the talks had to deliver on rights-based issues so that all people in the province are “treated equally.” “Nothing’s changed in terms of what we need to deliver on. We can’t acquiesce in the denial of rights,” she told reporters. Editing by Kate Holton and Toby ChopraAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1063,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks mostly inch up but dollar eases in wake of U.S. GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:49 PM / in 11 days","3 Min Read* Dow, S&P 500 up slightly in late-morning U.S. trading * U.S. GDP increases at a 3.2% annualized rate * Dollar slips and oil drops (Updates with early U.S. markets activity, changes byline and dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Global stock markets mostly edged higher on Friday as data showing U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter offset corporate earnings disappointments, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a 3.2% annualized rate. “(Stock) markets have been very strong all year, and this confirms that things are going fine, but we could see some volatility as investors dissect these numbers,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The jump in U.S. economic growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was 0.33% lower at 97.882. The index, which hit a 23-month high earlier in the session, is up 0.5% for the week. Global stocks were mixed near flat. Tech shares weighed on the U.S. market, with Intel Corp down sharply after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Exxon Mobil and Chevron also were lower following results Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.46 points, or 0.09%, to 26,486.54, the S&P 500 gained 4.43 points, or 0.15%, to 2,930.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.84 points, or 0.11%, to 8,109.84. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.16% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18%. The GDP release sets the stage for a Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, when investors will try to anticipate how the U.S. central bank will react to mostly resilient indicators of late. The rebound has not been mirrored in inflation, which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish. Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada have backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year. The Federal Reserve next week is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts published on Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.5036%, from 2.534% late on Thursday. U.S. crude fell 3.68% to $62.81 per barrel.

1064,US STOCKS-Tech stocks weigh on Wall St after weak Intel results - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:44 PM / in 11 days","4 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * First-quarter GDP increases at 3.2 pct rate * Ford jumps after Q1 profit, revenue beat estimates * Intel slides as data center sales remain weak * Exxon falls after profit miss, weighs on energy * Indexes down: Dow 0.07%, S&P 0.02%, Nasdaq 0.26% (Changes comment, updates prices to late morning) By Sruthi Shankar and Amy Caren Daniel April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Friday as technology shares were hit by Intel’s dour results, while investors assessed data that showed domestic growth was boosted by temporary factors in the first quarter. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate, lifted by trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. However, consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter, giving the report a weak tone. “Generally GDP was good, but if you look at personal consumption, it is probably telling the Fed to stay back right now because there is no real sign of inflation picking up right now,” said Tom Plumb, president of Plumb Funds in Madison, Wisconsin. “The markets are still looking for opportunities, though it continues to be cautious because there are a lot of people thinking the economy is going to roll over and we’re near all-time highs.” The S&P 500 is now about 0.5% away from its record high hit in late September, boosted by hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution, a dovish Federal Reserve and a largely positive first-quarter earnings season. Nearly 78% of the 178 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have surpassed estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts now expect earnings to decline 0.3% from a year earlier, a big improvement from the 2.3% fall forecast at the start of April. Intel Corp slumped 9.9% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Its results hit other chipmakers. The Philadelphia chip index tumbled 1.65%, while the broader technology sector fell 0.82%. Offering support to markets was Walt Disney Co, which rose 1.5% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle “Avengers: Endgame” hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut. Their shares drove a 0.25% gain in the consumer discretionary sector. At 10:58 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.60 points, or 0.07%, at 26,444.48, the S&P 500 was down 0.47 points, or 0.02%, at 2,925.70 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 21.01 points, or 0.26%, at 8,097.67. The energy sector fell 1.90%, the most among the three S&P sectors in the red, weighed down by lower crude prices and Exxon Mobil Corp’s downbeat results. Exxon declined 2.9% after its quarterly profit missed estimates on lower oil and gas prices and weakness across its businesses. Ford Motor Co surged 10.3% and was the biggest gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Amazon.com Inc rose 0.6% after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services. Mattel Inc jumped 7.7% after the toymaker beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue, as a more diverse range of Barbie dolls powered sales in the United States. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.65-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 40 new highs and 27 new lows.

1065,U.S. agency to cancel $929 million in California high-speed rail funds - Reuters,"February 19, 2019 /  11:05 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min Read (This February 19 story has been refiled to correct conversion to kilometers to show 836.8 km, not 826.8 km, in paragraph seven) (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Tuesday it will cancel $929 million in federal funds awarded by the Obama administration for a California high-speed rail project and is “actively exploring every legal option” to seek the return of $2.5 billion the state has already received. California Governor Gavin Newsom said last week the state will dramatically scale back a planned $77.3 billion high-speed rail project that has faced cost hikes, delays and management concerns, but will finish a smaller section of the line. The Transportation Department’s Federal Railroad Administration said in a letter it wanted to halt funding because the state had “failed to make reasonable progress.” It cited Newsom’s announcement to scale back the project. Newsom, in a statement, linked the Trump administration action to California leading 15 other states in challenging what he called “the President’s farcical ‘national emergency,’” to obtain funds for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it,” Newsom said of the rail funds. A coalition of 16 U.S. states sued Trump and top members of his administration on Monday, saying the emergency declaration would cause them to lose millions of dollars in federal funding for national guard units dealing with counter-drug activities and that the redirection of funds from authorized military construction projects would damage their economies. California planned to build a 520-mile (836.8 km) system in the first phase that would allow trains to travel at speeds up to 220 miles per hour (354 kph) in the traffic-choked state from Los Angeles to San Francisco and begin full operations by 2033. The Obama administration awarded the state a total of $3.5 billion in 2010 and California voters in 2008 approved nearly $10 billion in bond proceeds.  California can challenge the government’s action. Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Phil Berlowitz, Dan Grebler and Susan ThomasAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1067,Former Democratic Colorado Governor Hickenlooper joins presidential race - Reuters,"March 4, 2019 /  11:50 AM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper joined the growing field of Democratic presidential candidates on Monday, hoping to position himself as a centrist and an experienced officeholder who is best poised to defeat Republican President Donald Trump in 2020. Hickenlooper, 67, will tout his business background and two terms in office, during which Colorado’s economy soared and the state expanded healthcare and passed a gun control law. “I’ve proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver,” he said in a statement announcing his campaign on Monday, adding “we ... need to get things done.” He is the second governor to enter the Democratic race, following Washington Governor Jay Inslee, and joins a slew of sitting U.S. senators who have already begun campaigns. The field of Democratic candidates has grown to more than a dozen, with additional contenders still expected to join the field. Hickenlooper will hold a campaign launch in Denver on Thursday and then travel to Iowa, the state which holds the first nominating contest, for the weekend.  The former governor, who left office in January, refused to air negative ads during his two gubernatorial campaigns, a position his aides insist he will carry into his presidential bid. “There’s no profit margin in making enemies,” Hickenlooper says frequently to describe his political philosophy.  But staying positive will be harder to do in a presidential campaign expected to draw a large slate of Democratic hopefuls and against Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee who won in 2016 after a race replete with personal attacks on his opponents. In announcing his bid, Hickenlooper did poke fun at himself.  “As a skinny kid with Coke-bottle glasses and a funny last name, I’ve stood up to my fair share of bullies,” Hickenlooper said in a video launching his campaign. “Standing tall when it matters is really what drives me.”  Hickenlooper is jumping straight into a debate within the Democratic Party about the best path to beating Trump in 2020. He joins those in his party who believe an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters is the way to win back the White House. Others believe a fresh face, and particularly a diverse one, is needed to energize the party’s increasingly left-leaning base.  Hickenlooper has so far refused to take corporate money for the political action committee, named Giddy Up PAC, he formed to allow him to raise and spend federal funds helping other candidates - a position he is expected to continue in his presidential bid. Over the past two years, he has actively sought to bolster his bipartisan credentials. In 2017, he asked then-Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Republican, to join him in advocating for compromise over the future of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The two held a series of national events touting the ability to reach bipartisan agreement.  The tour generated speculation that Kasich and Hickenlooper could mount a third-party bid for president and vice president together, rumors both camps denied. Hickenlooper often speaks of his personal biography. After getting laid off from work as a geologist in the 1980s, he opened a brewery and pub. He frequently talks about the risk of opening his own business - a point he makes to argue he understands the needs of the economy.     He was elected mayor of Denver in 2007 and governor of Colorado in 2010. In 2012, the state’s residents voted to legalize marijuana. At the time, Hickenlooper called legalization a bad idea but agreed to implement the will of the voters. He has since said he believes legalization and the oversight system created in the state worked.

1071,"Ostrich jacket, fake rallies, therapy dogs and other odd scenes in Trump-Russia probe - Reuters","March 3, 2019 /  2:12 PM / in 2 months","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Question: What do you get when you combine Russian agents, a therapy dog and a $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket?  Answer: A criminal investigation that could decide the fate of a U.S. president. Donald Trump’s presidency has produced no shortage of eyebrow-raising moments - such as the former acting head of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, saying that Trump might be a Russian asset. And U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation has turned up some surreal anecdotes as he examines whether the 2016 Trump election campaign worked with Russia to win the White House.  Some of those episodes resemble reality television, fitting perhaps because Trump was once the star of his own show, “The Apprentice.” Moments of heightened drama appeared to be legitimate, but in fact involved paid actors and off-site directors. On July 9, 2016, a Facebook group called United Muslims of America staged a rally in Washington to support the Republican presidential nominee’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. One of the attendees held a sign featuring Clinton’s image and a quote: “I think Sharia Law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.”  It was a provocative message that appeared to show Clinton expressing support for the Muslim legal code that some conservatives complain could pose a threat to U.S. law.  According to U.S. prosecutors, the event was engineered by Russian agents working to undermine Clinton. Moscow has denied the allegations and the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that it ran an operation to meddle in the election. In a criminal indictment, Mueller’s team says Russians set up the Facebook group, organized the campaign event, and recruited someone to hold the sign. It was one of several events that year orchestrated by the Internet Research Agency, a Kremlin-backed troll farm in St. Petersburg that spent millions of dollars to disrupt the U.S. democratic process, according to court documents filed by Mueller’s office. Using fake personas, employees of the agency staged political rallies in New York, Pennsylvania, Washington and Florida, recruiting unwitting local activists, and, at times, Trump campaign officials to help out, prosecutors said. A volunteer for the Trump campaign agreed to provide signs for a Russian-organized “March for Trump” event in New York in June 2016 and sent out a press release for a “Down With Hillary” rally a month later, the indictment said. A Trump campaign official in Florida helped Russian organizers pick out sites for rallies there in August 2016.  One of those rallies featured a person dressed up as Clinton in a cage on a flatbed truck, wearing a prison uniform. Russians paid for the actor and the cage, prosecutors said. After the election, Russian agents staged dueling rallies in New York - one to support Trump, one to protest his victory.  The Russian government has denounced the allegations as absurd and ridiculed the notion that so few Russian nationals could undermine U.S. democracy. Jesse Ferguson, a former Clinton campaign official, said the campaign thought these were legitimate grassroots events.   “You can see where voters would have no way to figure out whether this is a rally of sympathizers - or subversives,” he said. THE $15,000 OSTRICH-SKIN JACKET Mueller’s team also revealed the lavish lifestyle of Trump’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort - and his disregard for lobbying laws and financial regulations. Prosecutors built their successful financial-fraud conviction of Paul Manafort last summer on a mountain of bank records and other financial documents. But one piece of evidence convicted Manafort in the court of public opinion: a $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket. A Washington Post fashion critic called the garment “an atrocity - both literal and symbolic.” Prosecutors introduced the jacket as evidence of the high-flying lifestyle that they say Manafort funded by lying to banks and hiding more than $16 million from tax authorities.  Prosecutors also cited $934,000 in purchases from an oriental rug store and $1.8 million in payments to home-theater installers. Manafort subsequently agreed to forfeit many of his assets, including five properties and several bank accounts, as part of a plea deal in a separate criminal case.  The plea deal does not require him to give up the ostrich skin jacket. Though Mueller has cultivated a reputation as a no-nonsense prosecutor, he has at times accommodated the quirks of his witnesses.  On Sept. 7, 2018, radio host Randy Credico showed up at court with a miniature emotional-support dog named Bianca.  For self-described “dirty trickster” Roger Stone, this was an ominous sign. According to Mueller’s team, Stone had spent much of the past year pressuring Credico to lie about their efforts to communicate with WikiLeaks, the website that released stolen Democratic emails during the election campaign. Stone and Credico were an odd pair. Stone was a longtime Republican operative with a tattoo of Richard Nixon on his back who had advised Trump on and off for decades. Credico was a former comedian and activist who had served as an intermediary between Stone and WikiLeaks in the final months of the campaign. Mueller’s evidence showed Stone urged Credico to keep their stories straight when investigators came calling. Credico invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was called before Congress in December 2017.  But Credico began to have second thoughts, incurring Stone’s wrath. In an April 2018 email released by prosecutors, Stone said he would “take that dog away from you” - an apparent reference to Bianca.  Five months later, Credico arrived at the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington to testify before Mueller’s grand jury, Bianca in tow.  Stone was charged in January with lying to Congress and witness tampering in an indictment that quotes extensively from his communications with Credico. He has pleaded not guilty. Bianca has been spending time recently lolling on a Southwestern-patterned rug, according to Credico’s social-media posts.

1072,White House to host CEOs for workforce advisory meeting - Reuters,"March 3, 2019 /  11:19 AM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday is hosting major chief executives who joined a Trump administration advisory board on workforce issues. Last month, the White House said the chief executives of Apple Inc, Walmart Inc, IBM Corp, Lockheed Martin Corp, Siemens USA, Home Depot Inc, Visa Incand other major companies are joining a 25-member board, co-chaired by adviser Ivanka Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. The council plans to hold its first meeting Wednesday afternoon at the White House complex, according to a public notice. President Donald Trump is expected to attend part of the sessions, a White House official confirmed. The meeting, set to last three hours, will be live-streamed. A White House official was unable to confirm on Saturday a list of the CEOs who are attending but said most are expected to take part. The board members are to serve until 2020 and will work with the administration’s National Council for the American Worker “to develop and implement a strategy to revamp the American workforce to better meet the challenges of the 21st century,” the White House said last month. Also on the council are the chief executives of the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, as well as the governors of Iowa and Indiana, the president of the North America’s Building and Trades Unions and mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said U.S. job openings reached a record high in December at 7.3 million. The White House says the job openings present “a mismatch between the skills needed and those being taught, requiring immediate attention to help more Americans enter the workforce.” This is the highest-profile White House business group to meet in 18 months. In August 2017, Trump disbanded two high-profile business advisory councils after numerous chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Virginia on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists. Trump dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum after eight executives, including the CEOS of Campbell Soup Co and 3M Co, quit the panels. Both councils were moving to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu NomiyamaAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1073,"Trump slams Mueller, mocks critics in fiery two-hour speech - Reuters","March 2, 2019 /  6:02 PM / in 2 months","4 Min Read (Note language in 1st and 9th paragraphs that may offend readers.) By Katanga Johnson and Steve Holland OXON HILL, Md. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Saturday attacked U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller ahead of his report on alleged Russia collusion by the Trump campaign in 2016 and said his political opponents were “trying to take me out with bullshit.” In a speech that lasted more than two hours — his longest since taking office two years ago — Trump also vented about Democrats, a proposed “green new deal,” illegal immigrants and criticism of his North Korea summit, while voicing optimism about his own re-election prospects in 2020. Addressing a cheering audience at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland, Trump veered off-script to launch a tirade about events that led to the Russia investigation.  He mocked his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and former FBI Director James Comey, both of whom Trump fired. “We’re waiting for a report by people who weren’t elected,” Trump said of the Mueller report, which is widely expected to be handed over to Attorney General William Barr in the coming days. Deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired Comey, whose agency had led the probe initially. Rosenstein is expected to step down by mid-March. Swarms of young adults stood to applaud Trump in the packed hotel ballroom where he spoke, at times breaking into chants like “Trump is our Man” and “We Love You.” Trump said Comey was Mueller’s “best friend,” and implied Comey should have been fired before Trump took office. “Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn’t be there and all of a sudden they are trying to take you out with bullshit, okay?” Trump said. “Now Robert Mueller never received a vote and neither did the person who appointed him,” he added. Trump still has made no move to fire Mueller, a Republican and respected former FBI director who has conducted his investigation with utmost secrecy. Trump also mocked the Southern accent of Sessions and  criticized him for recusing himself from the Russia probe. In November, Trump fired Sessions, a former U.S. senator from Alabama who was among the first Republican lawmakers to back Trump’s presidential bid. Trump’s face perspired as he lashed out at critics after a stressful week during which his former lawyer Michael Cohen accused the president in congressional testimony of breaking the law. Also, the president concluded a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi without reaching a denuclearization deal. The White House has rejected Cohen’s allegations and on Saturday, Trump said his talks with Kim were productive and could lead to an agreement in which other, unspecified nations provide aid to Pyongyang.  Trump addressed criticism from the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died after 17 months in a North Korean prison. They had complained when Trump said at a Hanoi news conference that he believed Kim had nothing to do with Warmbier’s death. “I love Otto,” Trump said, but added he was trying to maintain “a delicate balance” with the North Koreans as he attempts to coax them into giving up their nuclear program. Trump ridiculed a Democratic “green new deal” plan to fight climate change, pointing to provisions such as reducing airplane flights or eating less beef. “This is the craziest plan,” Trump said, adding that Democratic support for it would help Republicans politically. He said he believed he will win in 2020, rejecting critics who said lack of support for Trump was behind the Republican loss of the U.S. House of Representatives last November. “Wait ‘til you see what happens when I do run,” he said. Democratic National Committee spokesman Daniel Wessel quickly hit back on Saturday afternoon, describing the speech in a statement as “a bizarre, unhinged rant.” Reporting by Katanga Johnson and Steve Holland; editing by Michelle Price, Leslie Adler and David GregorioAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Addressing reporters after meeting with Argentine Finance Minister Nicólas Dujovne, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes added that he is working on a program to make domestic natural gas cheaper, which should result in a downward price “shock” in 30 to 60 days. Earlier in April, Bolsonaro said he had “initial sympathy” for the idea of privatizing Petrobras, as the firm is known, a shift in tone from prior statements.

1075,'Anemic' traffic raises doubts over Starbucks sales gains - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:35 PM / in 11 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Initial optimism over first-quarter results from Starbucks Corp was waning fast on Wall Street on Friday, as analysts questioned the longer-term prospects of its new sales push given subdued overall customer traffic numbers especially in China. The company on Thursday beat brokerage estimates for quarterly same-store sales on the back of demand for its new Cloud Macchiato, Matcha tea and cold brews in the United States. However, BTIG’s Peter Saleh was one of a number of sector analysts who said while customers forking out for higher-priced new drinks had helped drive growth in same-store sales, “anemic” traffic at cafes remained a concern. He and others pointed to a 1 percent decline in footfall at cafes in the Chinese market, viewed as crucial to the chain’s growth for the foreseeable future.  More broadly, transaction numbers, the substitute analysts use for customer traffic, were unchanged in all three of the company’s global regions. Shares in the company, which hit a record high after the results on Thursday, fell 1 percent in morning trade. “We remain cautious given near-term headwinds surrounding China, including cannibalization, increasing competition (and) a slowing economy,” Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan said.      Starbucks has also poured money into beefing up its delivery network in China as it battles with local startup Luckin Coffee, whose speedy growth led it to file for an IPO in the United States earlier this week. New menu items and partnerships with delivery services, the heart of the company’s strategy to win back customers lost to artisanal coffee shops and cheaper fast-food rivals, did help Starbucks’ sales in its home market. However, analysts said growth in China may continue to be subdued.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expects store expansion in China to take priority over comparable sales growth.  She downgraded her rating on Starbucks’ to “market perform” from “outperform”, arguing that the company facing tough sales comparisons later on in 2019 from last year and the current rich valuation of shares meant the stock had limited room to rise. “Investors will be hesitant to invest new money in a stock with a topline that, while still strong, is unlikely to meaningfully accelerate,” Herzog said.    Still, the company’s solid same-store growth in the United States, improving profit margins and a lower tax rate for the rest of the year led at least 6 Wall Street brokerages to raise their price targets on the stock to as high as $81. 11 of 29 brokerages rate Starbucks “buy” or higher, 17 “hold” and 1 “sell” or lower. Their median price target is $75. Reporting by Uday Sampath in BengaluruAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. See here for a complete list of exchanges and delays.© 2019 Reuters.

1076,FOREX-Dollar hit as weak inflation data takes shine off first-quarter GDP numbers - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:24 PM / 11 days ago","3 Min Read* Trade, inventories power U.S. economy to 3.2% growth in Q1 * Sterling on pace to end week down 0.5% on Brexit woes (New throughout, updates rates and adds comments post-U.S. market open; new byline, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of other currencies on Friday, after an overall strong U.S. first-quarter growth report was overshadowed by soft inflation data. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, released on Friday, versus the 2.0 percent estimated by economists polled by Reuters. The dollar, however, did not enjoy a boost from the report as traders focused on the core personal expenditures consumption price index figure, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, which increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. “Overall, U.S. growth last quarter was outstanding. But the soft inflation components were enough to spur some profit-taking in the buck’s winning week,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, was 0.33% lower at 97.882. The index, which hit a 23-month high earlier in the session, is up 0.5% for the week. While, the forecast-beating headline numbers defied the notion that the U.S. economy is slowing as fiscal stimulus fades, the underlying numbers offered plenty of causes for concern, Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “Taking out the over-sized boosts from net trade, inventories and highways investment, which will all be reversed in the coming quarters, growth was only around 1.0%,” Ashworth said. “Under those circumstances, we continue to expect that overall growth will slow this year, forcing the Fed to begin cutting interest rates before year-end,” he said. The Fed recently suspended its three-year monetary policy tightening campaign, dropping forecasts for any interest rate hikes this year. Recent U.S. data has been robust and has reinforced the belief that the United States is on a firmer economic footing than other leading economies. “Once the dust settles, the focus should shift back to the bullish U.S. growth theme which has been resoundingly positive for the dollar,” said Manimbo. The euro which is hovering near its weakest level against the greenback since May 2017, amid worries about the strength of the euro zone economy, was up 0.34% at $1.1168, ahead of a national election in Spain on Sunday. The pound rose 0.31% on Friday, but remained on pace to finish the week down about 0.5%, amid growing concern about stagnant talks around Britain’s exit from the European Union, or Brexit.

1078,UPDATE 3-Italy bond yields fall on bets of S&P ratings non-event - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  10:34 AM / 11 days ago","4 Min Read* S&P currently rates Italy BBB with negative outlook * Italy/Germany yield tightens after hitting 270.7 bps * Spanish election this weekend * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates move in Italy, adds fresh comment) By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Italy’s government bond yields fell sharply on Friday, pulling back from recent seven-week highs, on bets that S&P Global will refrain from downgrading the country at a ratings review. S&P Global will review Italy’s sovereign credit rating after the market closes on Friday. It currently rates Italy BBB with a negative outlook. A downgrade to BBB- would put the rating just one level above junk. Italy is rated Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB by Fitch. Unease about a ratings downgrade and tension within the ruling coalition had pushed 10-year bond yields to seven-week highs earlier this week, while the gap over benchmark German Bund yields briefly hit its widest in two months in early Friday trade. But Italian bond yields fell as the session wore on, a move analysts attributed to a view that Italy was safe from a downgrade for now. “I don’t think anybody has any inside knowledge on this so it is just speculation and markets are very thin,” said DZ Bank rates strategist Christian Lenk, adding that he believed that there could be a downgrade for Italy. In late trade, Italy’s 10-year bond yield was down nine basis points on the day at 2.59 percent, down from seven-week highs hit on Tuesday at 2.70 percent and set for its biggest daily fall in seven weeks. That pulled the Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap in from two-month highs around 271 bps. “It doesn’t make a lot of sense for ratings agencies to be ahead of the curve, so I wouldn’t expect them to downgrade Italy today. It is possible that some investors are buying on this view,” said Mizuho strategist Antoine Bouvet. Natixis rates strategist Cyril Regnat also said that S&P was unlikely to downgrade Italy later on Friday, though the wording of the accompanying statement could give the market an idea of where the rating was heading in the next six months. Italy was not the only southern European bond market in the spotlight. Spanish voters go to the polls this weekend in one of the most contentious elections in decades, with at least five parties in with a chance of being in the next government. The far-right party Vox is likely to win seats for the first time. Yet Spanish 10-year yields also dropped, by about six bps to 1.03 percent. “Spain has so far avoided a populist government, kept the country together, tackled corruption, and 67 percent of the population has a favourable opinion of the EU,” Indosuez Wealth Management said in a note. “As long as Vox does not enter a governing coalition, the Spanish elections could actually deliver a fillip to European markets.” S&P is also due on Friday to review Greece’s rating, currently B+, and a positive outlook suggests it may be upgraded. Elsewhere, euro zone bond markets showed little immediate reaction to U.S. GDP data, with Germany’s 10-year Bund yield remaining below zero percent as worry persists over the region’s economy. U.S. Treasury yields fell following Friday’s first-quarter growth report as weak inflation data tempered the strong headline figure.

1081,Good news from China could boost materials shares - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:16 PM / 11 days ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Even as the lift from optimism over prospects for U.S.-China trade detente shows signs of wearing off for the wider U.S. stock market, upbeat sentiment around China’s economy could bolster shares of materials companies. Shares of S&P 500 industrial and technology companies, which were buffeted by last year’s tit-for-tat tariffs as well as slowing global demand, have been very responsive to progress in U.S.-China trade relations and a strengthening Chinese economy. This year, those sectors have outpaced the ascent in the S&P 500, which reached a record closing high on Tuesday. Materials stocks have not been as sensitive, however, even though they also stand to benefit as a stronger Chinese economy lifts global consumption and industrial output. As China has taken measures to stimulate its economy, its economic data have turned more upbeat. That in turn could aid global growth, which has flagged as a result of China’s cooldown. “What we’re seeing is China spending more on stimulus: fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. “That’s likely to be a positive for materials.” The People’s Bank of China has cut banks’ reserve requirement ratio five times over the past year and is widely expected to ease policy further to spur lending and reduce borrowing costs. The stimulus appears to have boosted Chinese economic data, with factory activity growing in March for the first time in four months. Yet so far in 2019, the S&P 500 materials index has underperformed the S&P 500 at large, rising just 11.9% compared with 16.7% for the benchmark index. Moreover, it is among the biggest decliners in the period since the S&P’s previous record closing level on Sept. 20. The materials index has fallen 7% over those seven months, versus a 5.2% gain for technology and a 3% loss for industrials. Only the energy index has dropped more over that period. A trade agreement could serve as a catalyst for a bump in materials shares as a drag on China’s economy is lifted, some market strategists say. Some commodity prices, including those for copper and oil, have ascended this year as the prospects for the global economy have somewhat brightened. “It all goes back to the global growth outlook,” said Andrea DiCenso, portfolio manager for alpha strategies at Loomis Sayles in Boston. “With the front run in hard data, we’re beginning to see a pretty significant rally.” Additionally, a trade agreement is expected to include commitments from China to purchase higher quantities of U.S. products such as soybeans, which could benefit companies that make agricultural chemicals, including DowDuPont Inc and CF Industries Holdings Inc. CF Industries is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, and DowDuPont is scheduled to report before the market open on Thursday. To be sure, even with a trade agreement, some materials companies could face price pressures. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc fell 10.1% on Thursday after the copper mining company posted a lower-than-expected profit as its production slipped and its costs rose. A rollback of tariffs on Chinese imports, particularly aluminum and steel, would likely prompt a fall in some commodity prices, which could hurt prospects for certain materials companies, said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management in El Segundo, California. Even so, those drawbacks may be outweighed by the support for global demand fostered by a U.S.-China trade agreement.  “You could see a number of companies with lowered expectations bring them back up as they talk favorably about the impact that a trade deal would have on them,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.

1082,Warmbier parents blast 'evil' North Korea regime after Trump praises Kim - Reuters,"March 1, 2019 /  4:10 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The parents of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died after 17 months in a North Korean prison, blamed Kim Jong Un’s “evil regime” on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed the leader’s claim not to have known how their son was treated. Warmbier’s parents said they had held off commenting during the second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi, which was cut short on Thursday after the two sides failed to reach a deal for the reclusive communist nation to give up its nuclear weapons. “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto,” Fred and Cindy Warmbier said in a statement. “Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.” After the family’s sharp statement, the White House tried to explain what Trump meant. “What he said was that Chairman Kim says, what he believes Chairman Kim to have said, was that he was not aware of what had happened to Otto Warmbier when it happened,” Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News.  Trump had kind words for the family later on Twitter: “I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. ... Of course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto’s mistreatment and death.” The U.S. president drew criticism after he praised Kim’s leadership and said he accepted Kim’s assertion that he had not been aware of how Warmbier was treated while in detention. “He tells me that he didn’t know about it, and I will take him at his word,” Trump told a news conference. Prominent Republicans on Thursday did not share Trump’s acceptance of Kim’s word, including close Trump ally U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who said he didn’t “buy it for a minute.” It wasn’t the first time Trump has faced criticism for appearing to side with autocratic leaders. He gave Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the benefit of the doubt after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year. In July, Trump refused to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for interfering in U.S. elections.  Warmbier, 22, died on June 19, 2017, shortly after he was flown home to Ohio in a coma after being held by North Korea for 17 months. “Otto should have never been arrested in the first place and Kim is responsible for that decision and everything that subsequently happened,” said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.

1083,Factbox: Crowd of U.S. Congress committees investigating Trump - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  5:07 PM / 11 days ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - At least half a dozen committees of the U.S. Congress are investigating President Donald Trump, who is refusing to cooperate with most of them since the April 18 release of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, setting up a likely court battle. The clash between Trump and the Democrats who lead the House of Representatives committees intensified after Trump framed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings as an exoneration, though Mueller neither charged nor exonerated the president. The report, in the view of Democrats, provided plentiful leads for their further inquiries into ties between Moscow and the 2016 Trump campaign, as well as Trump’s subsequent efforts to stifle the long-running Mueller probe. Committees are also looking into Trump’s still undisclosed taxes, potential conflicts of interest involving the sprawling business interests he has not divested since taking office, and other aspects of his turbulent presidency. Congressional subpoenas are being issued and contempt-of-Congress citations are being considered for administration officials who are being advised by Trump to ignore the probes. Civil enforcement actions in the courts may follow. With the 2020 election campaigns underway and casting both sides’ efforts in an increasingly partisan light, here are the key congressional committees involved. The committee’s Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler is an old foe of Trump, going back years to a fight between the two New Yorkers over a large Trump real estate project in Manhattan. Nadler’s panel has subpoenaed the Justice Department seeking the full, unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence, as well as former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify in May. Committee investigators are also focused on contacts Trump’s campaign had with Russia during the 2016 presidential race. Any effort to impeach Trump would likely begin in the committee. In a book he published in 2000, Trump called Nadler “one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.” Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings’ panel in February held 2019’s first public hearing on Trump’s many issues, taking testimony from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who is scheduled to report to prison next month.  On April 2, the committee voted to subpoena Carl Kline, a former White House official, over a probe into security clearances granted by the administration. The White House said it told Kline to ignore the committee’s subpoena. Cummings said the panel will soon vote on whether to hold Kline in contempt of Congress over the matter. Trump has filed an unprecedented lawsuit attempting to squash a committee subpoena seeking his past financial records from Mazars USA, an accounting firm long used by Trump. The administration has rebuffed a committee request for an interview with John Gore, an official who was involved in a decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census. Also, the White House has refused a request from the panel for Trump’s top immigration aide Stephen Miller to testify. The House tax committee, led by Democrat Richard Neal, has asked the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to hand over six years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns.  Unlike presidents in recent decades, Trump has refused to disclose his returns, which committee Democrats want to obtain and review. Committee Republicans argue the committee’s request oversteps its authority. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did not meet an April 23 committee deadline for handing over the returns and said that a “final decision” on the request would be made by May 6. The committee’s chief, whom Trump has mocked as “sleazy” and “little pencil neck Adam Schiff,” is examining Russian influence in U.S. politics and whether any foreign countries hold leverage over Trump, his family, his business or his associates. Like other panels, Schiff’s has expressed an interest in having Mueller testify about his findings. Republican Chairman Mark Warner’s committee is also looking into Russia’s role in influencing U.S. elections. The committee could release its findings later this year. In late March, Trump adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, made a second appearance before the panel, according to congressional sources. Topics discussed in the closed-door sessions were not made public. Democratic Chairwoman Maxine Waters, whom Trump has also frequently mocked, is leading a probe into Trump’s ties with Deutsche Bank AG, one of the world’s largest financial institutions, as well as potential Russian money laundering through the bank. The committee oversees the financial services industry including banks. Waters has said the House should impeach Trump.

1084,"U.S. increases pressure on Maduro with new sanctions, revokes visas of associates - Reuters","March 1, 2019 /  2:20 PM / in 2 months","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed new sanctions on six Venezuelan security officials and revoked the visas of dozens of associates and their families with ties to President Nicolas Maduro, in the latest move to pile pressure on him to step down. The U.S. Treasury said the six current or former security officials controlled groups that blocked humanitarian aid from reaching people in Venezuela last weekend from neighboring countries Colombia and Brazil. “We are sanctioning members of Maduro’s security forces in response to the reprehensible violence, tragic deaths, and unconscionable torching of food and medicine destined for sick and starving Venezuelans,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin said. The United States “will continue to target Maduro loyalists prolonging the suffering of the victims of this man-made humanitarian crisis,” Mnuchin added. Separately, the U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, said the United States had revoked visas of “dozens more” Venezuelans, although declined to elaborate, saying U.S. laws prevented him from discussing details about visas. “We continue to look at close associates of Maduro, who with their families have visas to the United States,” Abrams said at a news conference.  Friday’s action is the second set of sanctions by the United States this week. On Monday, Washington targeted four Venezuelan state governors allied with Maduro and called on allies to freeze the assets of state-owned oil company PDVSA. U.S. sanctions block any assets the individuals control in the United States and bars U.S. entities from doing any business or financial transactions with them. The Trump administration and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Guaido, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, has invoked constitutional provisions to assume an interim presidency, arguing that Maduro’s re-election last year was fraudulent. Guaido has since been recognized by most Western nations as the rightful leader of Venezuela.  Maduro still controls the military, state institutions and oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, which provides 90 percent of the country’s export revenue. Russia has accused the United States of preparing to intervene militarily in Venezuela and this week, along with China, blocked a U.S. bid to get the U.N. Security Council to take action on Venezuela. Abrams said he was in talks with Russia on Venezuela. Both Moscow and Beijing were unlikely to provide additional financial support to Maduro’s government although they continued to give him diplomatic and political cover, he said. “We have made the argument, unsuccessfully to date, to both Russia and China that they are not helping themselves,”  Abrams said. “If they are concerned ... about the recovery of money they have lent or invested, a bankrupt Venezuelan economy will never be able to repay those amounts, only a Venezuela in recovery will be able to do so.” Reporting by Lesley Wroughton; Additional reporting by Makini Brice and Susan Heavey; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Grant McCoolAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1085,CVC in talks over 1 billion euro sale of Continental Foods: sources - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  3:11 PM / in 11 days","2 Min ReadMADRID/LONDON/WARSAW (Reuters) - Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners is in talks with potential bidders about a possible sale of its Continental Foods business, which could be worth as much as 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion), five sources familiar with the matter said. Among those interested in the packaged soup and sauce business are Spanish food group Agrolimen and Polish group Maspex, according to three of the sources, who declined to be identified as the situation is private. Agrolimen has shown interest in Continental Foods previously.    CVC, Maspex and Continental Foods declined to comment. Agrolimen could not be reached, though its GB Foods business declined to comment. Continental, home to brands like Liebig in France and Erasco in Germany, is the latest in a string of packaged food assets to come on the block as consumer tastes are moving away from processed food.  Companies including Nestle, Unilever and Campbell Soup have all pursued divestitures as they try to boost profits and efficiency in an increasingly competitive market. CVC bought Continental in late 2013 from Campbell Soup for 400 million euros. It tried to sell the business in 2017, but was unsuccessful. Barcelona-based Agrolimen is the frontrunner in the unofficial process launched by CVC, according to two of the sources. The Spanish company has two businesses - GB Foods, which makes Gallina Blanca soup and Grand d’Italia pasta with revenue of 758 million euros in 2018, and Affinity Pet Care, the world’s sixth largest pet food company, according its website.  Maspex is a leading producer of juices and drinks in central and eastern Europe and also sells pasta, cereal and jams. Editing by Jane MerrmanAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The surplus for April-February was C$3.1 billion, compared to a deficit of C$6 billion in the same 2017/18 period. Revenues climbed by 8.5 percent, mainly due to higher tax receipts, while program expenses rose by 4.8 percent. The surplus for February was C$4.3 billion compared with C$2.8 billion in February 2018. Revenues jumped by 12.2 percent while program expenses posted a more modest 6.9 percent gain. Last month, the Liberals unveiled their new budget, projecting a C$14.9 billion deficit in 2018/19, with the deficit rising to C$19.8 billion in fiscal 2019/20.

1087,Sterling headed for worst week in a month as Brexit drags on - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  9:01 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - The British pound was headed for its biggest weekly drop in a month on Friday, dragged down by growing concern about stagnant Brexit talks. A broad dollar rebound this month — it has gained against all its major rivals — has also undercut the appeal of the pound before a Bank of England policy meeting next week where policymakers are expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Sterling - stuck around $1.29 - has struggled this week as lawmakers returned from an Easter recess with little sign of progress in Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to convince lawmakers to back her Brexit deal.

Against the euro, the pound traded flat at 86.3 pence. On a weekly basis, it is set to decline 0.6 percent, its biggest drop in four weeks.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate, lifted by trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. However, consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter, giving the report a weak tone. “The data is a vote of confidence that tells us the economy is humming and fears of a slowdown have been assuaged for the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “Markets have been very strong all year, and this confirms that things are going fine, but we could see some volatility as investors dissect these numbers.” The data comes as investors look for fresh catalysts to push the markets higher, with the S&P 500 now about 0.7% below its record high hit in late September, boosted by largely positive earnings reports. Nearly 78% of the 178 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Wall Street now expects earnings to be in line with the year-ago quarter, a sharp improvement from the 2.3% fall expected at the start of April. Intel Corp slumped 9.4% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Its results hit other chipmakers, with the Philadelphia chip index down 2.65%, while the broader technology sector fell 1.11%. At 9:43 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 40.14 points, or 0.15%, at 26,421.94, the S&P 500 was down 5.26 points, or 0.18%, at 2,920.91 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 46.04 points, or 0.57%, at 8,072.64. The energy sector fell 1.34%, the most among the three S&P sectors in the red, weighed down by lower crude prices and Exxon Mobil Corp’s downbeat results. Exxon declined 2.5% after its quarterly profit missed estimates on lower oil and gas prices and weakness across its businesses. Offering support to markets was Ford Motor Co, whose shares surged 8.8% after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Amazon.com Inc, rose 0.3% after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services. Mattel Inc jumped 7.6% after the toymaker beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue, as a more diverse range of Barbie dolls powered sales in the United States. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 17 new lows.

1092,PRECIOUS-Gold eyes weekly gain as dollar slips after U.S. GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  10:29 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min Read* Bullion up about 0.5 pct so far this week * Spot gold neutral in $1,274-$1,284 range-analyst (Updates prices, adds comment) By Sethuraman N R April 26 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Friday as the dollar fell after data suggested an acceleration of U.S. growth was driven by temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. Spot gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,282.37 per ounce at 1259 GMT, after hitting its highest since April 16 at $1,283.59. The metal, which reached its lowest since late December on Tuesday at $1,265.90, is up 0.5 percent so far this week, and is poised for its first weekly gain since March 22. U.S. gold futures edged up 0.3 percent to $1,282.30. “We have seen a pretty strong recovery after a dip following the GDP data. The dollar index is turning weaker (helping gold),” said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst with Kitco metals. “Also, there seems to be a bit of short covering as we are heading in to the weekend and some technical buying.” The dollar fell to a session low against a basket of currencies, after data showed that while U.S. growth accelerated in the first quarter, the jump was driven by trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. Even strong data out of the U.S. was unlikely to change the Federal Reserve’s monetary strategy, analysts said. According to a Reuters poll, major central banks are done tightening policy as the global growth outlook has softened across developed and emerging economies, with scant prospects for a surge in inflation. The view is supported by a recent slashing of its growth outlook by the Bank of Canada and a disclosure from the Bank of Japan that it will keep interest rates super-low for at least one more year. “Despite a signiﬁcant drop in long-term real rates, gold prices have remained ﬂat year-to-date as recession fears have receded since late last year,” Goldman Sachs said in a note. Central bank gold purchases have been running strong this year, which could support prices, the bank said. While gold has fallen nearly 5 percent from a peak in February, bullion’s recovery from this week’s four-month low is painting a neutral picture in technical charts. Gold looks neutral in a $1,274-$1,284 range, and an escape could suggest a direction, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Among other precious metals, silver was up 0.2 percent at $15.01 per ounce. Platinum rose 0.7 percent to $888.46, while palladium was up 1 percent at $1,427.71 per ounce.

The British-run province has been without a devolved executive for over two years since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein withdrew from the compulsory power-sharing government with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). But the shooting dead last week of 29-year-old reporter Lyra McKee during rioting by militant Irish nationalists has raised pressure on the parties from voters and the two governments to re-establish the regional government that is central to Northern Ireland’s 1998 peace agreement. “In coming together with other political leaders in St Anne’s Cathedral to pay tribute to Lyra McKee, we gave expression to the clear will and determination of all of the people of these islands to reject violence and to support peace,” British Prime Minister Theresa May and Irish premier Leo Varadkar said in a joint statement. “We also heard the unmistakable message to all political leaders that people across Northern Ireland want to see a new momentum for political progress. We agree that what is now needed is actions and not just words from all of us who are in positions of leadership.

1095,U.S. Senate weighs blocking Trump's border emergency gambit - Reuters,"February 28, 2019 /  9:05 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional efforts to end President Donald Trump’s U.S.-Mexico border emergency declaration - an attempt by him to fund a border wall without approval from Congress - intensified on Thursday with the introduction of a bipartisan resolution to block him in the Senate. The measure faces an uphill path to passage, but even a close vote in the chamber, controlled by his fellow Republicans, would be an embarrassment for Trump, who has failed over more than two years in office to persuade Congress to fund his wall. The dispute triggered the nation’s longest partial government shutdown in December-January, but that did not secure for Trump the $5.7 billion he has been demanding for his “great, great wall.” Trump warned Republicans not to vote for the Senate resolution, saying in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, scheduled to air later on Thursday, that doing so would put them in “great jeopardy” politically with voters. But Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democrat Tom Udall, sponsors of the bipartisan measure, said Congress needs to stand up for its power over making major decisions about spending taxpayer money and prevent Trump from circumventing the U.S. Constitution. “The question before us is not whether to support or oppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President Trump,” Collins declared on the Senate floor. “Rather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch, now or in the future, to hold the power that the founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?” The resolution, identical to one already approved in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, is also sponsored by two other senators: Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. At its present level of support among senators, the measure would need the backing of at least one other Republican to win final Senate approval. Even with that, however, it might ultimately be only a symbolic gesture of defiance because Trump has vowed to veto the resolution if it arrives on his desk, an action that would likely throw the fight over his emergency into the courts. Trump declared a national emergency on Feb. 15 after Congress declined to give him the $5.7 billion this year for his wall. The president said emergency powers would empower him to divert money from other accounts already approved by Congress, including military construction projects, to his wall. Another Senate Republican, Lamar Alexander, argued Thursday that the president might avoid the clash with Congress if he would take the wall money from Pentagon accounts supporting counter-drug activities, instead of military construction. Democrats argue that there is no actual border emergency and even if there were, Trump would still be overreaching.  “The emergency law that President Trump invoked allows the military to redirect funds only if an emergency ‘requires use of the armed forces,’” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said at a hearing on Trump’s emergency. “This law is supposed to be used for actions such as building airfields or barracks to help our troops fight wars overseas,” he said. The battle in Congress is the latest chapter in a long-running war between Trump and Democrats over border security and immigration policy. A coalition of 16 U.S. states led by California has sued Trump and top members of his administration to block his emergency declaration. Moody’s Investors Service said on Thursday that Trump’s emergency declaration to build a border wall with Mexico means the U.S. territory of Guam could lose $750 million in military construction funds. This would be a “credit negative” because the U.S. military presence is one of the island’s dominant economic forces, the credit rating agency said in a statement.

1096,Senate confirms ex-coal lobbyist to lead U.S. environment regulator - Reuters,"February 28, 2019 /  12:10 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday confirmed President Donald Trump’s candidate, a former coal lobbyist, to lead the nation’s top environmental regulator, infuriating Democrats and conservation groups who said his policies were endangering public health. Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a Washington insider with years of experience working as a congressional staffer, was nominated by Trump in January to permanently replace Scott Pruitt, who resigned in July after widespread criticism for alleged ethical missteps. “As acting administrator of EPA, (Wheeler) has prioritized commonsense policies that protect our air and water, while allowing our economy to grow,” said Senate Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming following the 52-47 vote. Only one Republican in the Republican-controlled Senate opposed Wheeler, Maine’s Susan Collins, who argued his efforts to roll back standards on emissions blamed for climate change takes the country in the wrong direction. Business interests like oil and coal, eager to see reduced regulation, were quick to hail Wheeler’s confirmation while Democrats and conservation groups are worried that environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration are going too far.  “Throughout his career, Andrew Wheeler has shown a clear disregard for the EPA’s mission to protect the public and environment,” said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from California, after voting against him. While running the EPA on an interim basis, Wheeler oversaw the weakening of Obama-era rules limiting carbon and mercury emissions from power plants and standards on carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks. He has also advanced an initiative to lift a summertime ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline that was enacted to curb smog. “Andrew Wheeler has been instrumental in advancing the most regressive environmental proposals of the Trump Administration —weakening public health protections against dirty cars, heat-trapping methane, toxic mercury, pollution from coal plants, and so much more,” Moms Clean Air Force, a civil society group combating air pollution. During his confirmation hearing in January, Wheeler said he did not believe climate change was a major crisis - a stance that resonates with Trump’s skepticism but which clashes with the scientific consensus that global warming will have devastating consequences if not addressed urgently. Like Pruitt, Wheeler held nearly 20 times more meetings with industry representatives than with conservationists during his first two months on the job, according to a copy of his schedule reviewed by Reuters. Prior to the vote, Wheeler had also faced a brief pushback from five Republican senators from oil states - including Ted Cruz of Texas - over what they perceived as his support of policies favorable to the ethanol industry.  The corn and oil industries have conflicting interests when it comes to biofuels like ethanol, which compete with petroleum for market share. All five senators had met with Wheeler earlier in February over the issue and voted to approve Wheeler on Thursday. Michelle Bloodworth, president of America’s Power (ACCCE), a coal industry lobby group said Wheeler was a “thoughtful leader who understands the need for sensible environmental policies.” Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Peter Cooney and Marguerita ChoyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1097,Puerto Rico oversight board to appeal appointments ruling - Reuters,"February 28, 2019 /  7:01 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - A recent U.S. Appeals Court ruling that found Puerto Rico’s federally created fiscal oversight board was unconstitutionally appointed will be appealed to the Supreme Court, the board announced on Thursday. The board, which was authorized under a 2016 federal law known as PROMESA, also said it is seeking to put on hold the 1st  Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals’ decision to set a 90-day period to allow President Donald Trump and the Senate to constitutionally validate the appointments or reconstitute the board. In a Feb. 15 ruling, the Boston-based appeals court said oversight board members are principal U.S. officers and should have been appointed by the president “with the advice and consent of the Senate.” The board said it was established “as an entity within the government of Puerto Rico and not the federal government” and that the U.S. Constitution’s Appointments Clause does not apply to its members. “PROMESA’s appointment process has established a bipartisan board, ensuring balanced decisions to help Puerto Rico recover and prosper,” a statement from the board said, adding that a majority of its members voted for the appeal.  The litigation, which was filed by creditors of the U.S. commonwealth, including Aurelius Investment LLC and bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, also sought a dismissal of Puerto Rico’s Title III bankruptcy cases - a move the appeals court rejected. The island is trying to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations in federal court. U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is hearing the island’s bankruptcy, ruled in July that the appointment of the board’s members did not violate the U.S. Constitution. John Elwood, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins, said the case is a credible candidate for review “because a court has held that an act of Congress is unconstitutional.”  “It’s just not clear to me how broadly important this ruling is,” he added. The Supreme Court hears less than 100 of the thousands of appeals filed each year. If it were to take up the Puerto Rico case, it would likely be decided in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2020.

1098,Finland's Fortum frees up cash by replacing Nasdaq collateral with bond - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  1:34 PM / in 11 days","2 Min ReadOSLO, April 26 (Reuters) - Finland’s Fortum has freed up 310 million euros ($345 million) of cash previously used as collateral at Nasdaq’s Nordic power exchange by replacing it with a bank bond, it said on Friday. The move, reflected in Fortum’s first-quarter cash flow, aimed to boost available funds for operations and investments, investor relations manager Mans Holmberg told Reuters. The extra money helped lift Fortum’s cash flow before financing activities, which rose to 918 million euros in the quarter from just 60 million euros a year ago, the company’s earnings report showed. Before buying a 49.9 percent stake in Uniper, Fortum held billions of euros in cash and posted some of it as collateral for clearing trades at Nasdaq, Holmberg said. “Now the situation is different and we are back to normal. Freeing up cash is something that is reasonable to do, at a really low cost,” he said, without disclosing the name of the bank from which Fortum secured the bond or revealing the cost. Fortum remains a clearing member at the exchange, he said, adding the move was aligned with Nasdaq’s rules and criteria. Nasdaq said this month it would raise the amount of cash reserves Nordic power firms must hold to clear trades directly in its commodities exchange, a move traders said would make the market safer but push smaller firms out of the clearing house. A Norwegian trader in September failed to cover his losses on the Nordic power market, forcing members of Nasdaq’s Nordic commodities exchange to replenish 114 million euros of clearing house contingency funds lost in the default. After that, Nasdaq said it would introduce changes to prevent any repeat. Holmberg said Fortum, not the bank that provided the bond, carried the trading risk, so Fortum would have to add any further collateral required. Fortum reported improved quarterly profit year-on-year on Friday, although it fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. $1 = 0.8981 euros

1100,"TREASURIES-Yields fall on weak inflation data, shrug off GDP reading - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  1:29 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min Read(Recasts, adds analyst quotes, report details, updates yields) By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell following Friday’s first-quarter growth report as weak inflation data tempered the strong headline figure. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report released on Friday, versus the 2.0 percent estimated by economists polled by Reuters. But Federal Reserve officials are likely to shrug off the surge in growth last quarter and focus on a measure of domestic demand that excludes trade, inventories and government spending, which increased at only a 1.3% rate, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013, after increasing at a 2.6% pace in the October-December quarter. The Fed is also likely to focus on the disappointing core personal expenditures consumption price index figure, which increased at only a 1.3% rate versus 1.8% in the prior quarter. PCE is the Fed’s preferred inflation metric. “Offsetting the GDP growth was the GDP deflator, which was 0.9 percent,” Stan Shipley, strategist at Evercore ISI, said of the GDP price index. “From a Treasury perspective, the Fed is going to focus on the inflation number,” which is why yields fell, he said. Yields across maturities were lower, with the biggest loses at the short end of the curve. The two-year yield, a proxy for investor expectations of interest-rate hikes, fell 5.2 basis points, last at 2.278%. The benchmark 10-year government note yield was last 3.9 basis points lower at 2.495%. (Reporting by Kate Duguidd; editing by Jonathan Oatis)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product increased at a 3.2 percent annualized rate, lifted by trade and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015, factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters. Growth was also boosted by an increase in government investment, which offset sharp slowdown in consumer and business spending. “The data is a vote of confidence that tells us the economy is humming and fears of a slowdown have been assuaged for the moment,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “Markets have been very strong all year, and this confirms that things are going fine, but we could see some volatility as investors dissect these numbers.” The data comes as investors look for fresh catalysts to push the markets higher, with the S&P 500 now 0.5% below its record high hit in late September, helped by largely positive earnings reports. Nearly 78% of the 178 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have surpassed earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Wall Street now expects earnings to be in line with the year-ago quarter, a sharp improvement from the 2.3% fall expected at the start of April. At 9:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 12 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.09% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 30.75 points, or 0.39%. Amazon.com Inc rose 1.8% in premarket trading after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services. Ford Motor Co shares surged 7.3% after the automaker posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Among decliners, Intel Corp slumped 7.8% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Exxon Mobil Corp fell 2.2% after its quarterly profit missed estimates on lower oil and gas prices as well as weakness in its refining and chemicals businesses. Mattel Inc jumped 7.3% after the toymaker beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue, as a more diverse range of Barbie dolls powered sales in the United States.

1103,Slack posts $140.7 mln loss in FY 2019 as it prepares to go public - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  1:19 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min ReadApril 26 (Reuters) - Slack Technologies Inc, operator of the popular workplace instant-messaging app, reported a loss of $140.7 million in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2019, the company said on Friday in a regulatory filing ahead of its planned public market debut. The company said its daily active users exceeded 10 million in the three months ended Jan. 31, 2019. Slack expects to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SK”, it said. The San Francisco-based company is seeking to go public via a direct listing, making it the second big technology company after Spotify Technology SA to bypass the traditional route of listing shares through an initial public offering. A direct listing is a cheaper way of becoming a public company as the process requires fewer investment banks and therefore lower fees. In a direct listing, however, a company does not sell any new shares to raise money. Instead, it gives existing shareholders the opportunity to cash out. Slack is the latest in a string of high-profile technology companies looking to go public this year. Lyft Inc, Pinterest and Zoom Video Communications have completed IPOs so far in 2019. The company is hoping for a valuation of more than $10 billion in the listing, Reuters had previously reported. Some early investors and employees have been selling the stock at around $28, valuing the company close to $17 billion, Kelly Rodriques, CEO of Forge, a brokerage company, told CNBC on Thursday. Slack set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different. Its competitors include Microsoft Teams, a free chat add-on for Microsoft’s Office365 users.

1105,"U.S. April auto sales seen falling as higher prices keep away young buyers: J.D. Power, LMC Automotive - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  1:14 PM / 11 days ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to drop about 3.5 percent in April from a year-ago period, as rising prices and reduced incentives pinch buyers at the lower end of the spectrum, according to industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive. The consultancies see total U.S. vehicle sales of about 1.37 million units in April, while retail sales are expected to drop 5.3 percent to 1,041,600 vehicles, the consultancies said on Friday. “With the volume contraction focused on the low end of the market, the dip in industry retail sales poses a smaller threat to OEM profitability than headline sales results suggest,” Thomas King, senior vice-president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power, said. Sales of vehicles priced below $20,000 plunged 25 percent from a year-ago period, but demand for vehicles costing $40,000 and above rose 7 percent. Higher prices and reduced incentives are squeezing younger buyers, who have been affected the most. Among various segments, sales are expected to fall 8 percent among those aged between 16 years and 35 years, compared with a mere 4 percent decline among buyers above 55 years in April. Transaction prices in April expected to touch $33,695, up about 4 percent from a year-ago period, is also the highest-ever level for the month. Incentive spending has fallen to $3,408 per unit, $300 less than for the same period a year ago. LMC Automotive, however, maintained its forecast for total light-vehicle sales to 16.9 million units this year, a 2.2 percent fall from 2018. The forecast follows weak U.S. auto sales here for March and the first quarter, as American customers continued to abandon buying passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs, which are far more profitable for automakers.

1109,U.S. House approves expanded background checks for gun sales - Reuters,"February 27, 2019 /  9:22 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would expand background checks for gun sales to include firearm purchases at gun shows and over the internet, a measure likely to face Senate and White House opposition. The background check bill, which was approved by a 240-190 vote, is the first gun control measure taken up by Democrats since they regained control of the House in the 2018 congressional midterm elections.  The bill is likely to face opposition when it goes to the Republican-controlled Senate, however. It would also need President Donald Trump’s signature in order to become law. The White House said on Monday that Trump’s advisers would recommend the president veto the legislation because it would apply “burdensome requirements” that are “incompatible with the Second Amendment’s guarantee of an individual right to keep arms.” Trump has previously indicated he supported efforts to extend background checks to all gun sales. “I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!” Trump tweeted a year ago, after a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead. Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans had prevented a vote on a background check bill when they controlled the chamber, and that while there were differences among Democrats about how to curb gun violence, the background check bill had broad support. “The carnage that we’ve seen perpetrated by gun violence over the last decade has heightened the American people’s concern, and the bill that we’re putting on the floor we believe has the support of 90 percent of the American people,” Hoyer said. From 2009 to 2017, there were at least 173 shootings in the United States in which four or more people were killed, with at least 1,001 total deaths, according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee where the background check bill originated, said on Wednesday that the bill was ineffective because it  “foolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will suddenly submit themselves to background checks.” The House is set to vote on Thursday on a second bill that would extend the time it takes to conduct a background check before a gun sale to 10 days from minutes.

1110,U.S. House Democrats introduce sweeping 'Medicare for All' bill - Reuters,"February 26, 2019 /  10:17 PM / in 2 months","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled an ambitious proposal on Tuesday to move all Americans into the government’s Medicare health insurance program, tapping into public frustration over the rising cost of healthcare that has become a key issue for the party as it seeks to gain control of Congress and the White House in 2020.  The bill, unveiled by Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal from Washington state, would transition the U.S. healthcare system to a single-payer “Medicare for All” program funded by the government in two years. The legislation is the party’s most high-profile and ambitious single-payer proposal in the new Congress and has more than 100 co-sponsors, many from the party’s progressive flank.  It is unlikely to gain the support of any Republicans in the House or the Senate, who have derided single-payer healthcare as a socialist policy and oppose government interference in healthcare. It also remains unclear whether Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring the legislation up for a vote. “Americans are literally dying because they can’t afford insulin or they can’t get the cancer treatment they need,” Jayapal said on a call with reporters on Tuesday. “There are some things that should not be provided through the for-profit market.”  Medicare currently serves about 60 million Americans who are age 65 or older, or disabled. Jayapal’s legislation would eliminate the age threshold. The new Medicare would not require any beneficiaries to pay premiums or deductibles and would not charge patients co-pays or out-of-pocket costs after receiving care.  It does not include new or increased taxes or other additional revenues to pay for the healthcare overhaul. Jayapal said possible ways to pay for the bill include a tax on millionaires and billionaires, employer premiums and closing tax loopholes for the wealthy. The idea of Medicare for All was first proposed by Independent Bernie Sanders in 2017 as a single-payer system that would largely replace private insurance. It gained traction among Democrats running for congressional office in 2018, and is now a central campaign issue for party members vying for the 2020 presidential nomination.  A Reuters/IPSOS poll in August found that 70 percent of Americans support some sort of single-payer system. The health industry has opposed single-payer proposals, saying they would ultimately lead to less access to care. Critics include the American Hospital Association and America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the health insurance industry’s biggest trade group. “This bill will hurt patients, consumers, and taxpayers: Americans will pay more, to wait longer, for worse care,” AHIP said in a statement. “Let’s focus on real solutions that deliver real results, not a one-size-fits-all government system.”     The House proposal unveiled on Tuesday would not eliminate private health insurance entirely, as it would allow patients to purchase supplemental coverage. Many Americans under the age of 65 rely on private insurance provided by their employer. A single-payer system is variously understood as one in which the government pays for healthcare for more people, or one where the governments owns health services providers and manages all aspects of care, such as in the United Kingdom.  Several U.S. Democratic lawmakers have introduced different versions of expanded Medicare, such as allowing people aged 50 and older to buy into the program. The new House proposal would cover most aspects of patients’ care, including primary care, hospital and outpatient services, prescription drugs, dental, vision, audiology, women’s reproductive health services, maternity and newborn care.

1113,Take Five: Dollar darling. World markets themes for the week ahead - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  1:54 PM / in 11 days","7 Min Read(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. The dollar has zipped to near two-year highs, leaving many scratching their heads. To many, it’s down to signs the U.S. economy is chugging ahead while the rest of the world loses steam. After all, Wall Street is busily scaling new peaks day after day.  Never mind the cause, the effect is stark. The euro has tumbled to 22-month lows against the dollar and investors are preparing for more, buying options to shield against further downside. Emerging-market currencies are also in pain, with Turkish lira and Argentine peso both sharply weaker.  Now U.S. data need to keep surprising on the upside or even just meet expectations. The International Monetary Fund sees U.S. growth at 2.3 percent this year. For Germany, the forecast is 0.8 percent. The U.S. economy’s rude health has given rise to speculation the Fed might resume raising interest rates. Unlikely. But as other countries — Canada, Sweden and Australia are the latest — hint at more policy easing, there seems to be one way the dollar can go. Up. (GRAPHIC: Dollar outperforms G10 FX - tmsnrt.rs/2Dz17S5)  Wall Street is near record highs and recession worries are receding, so as we mentioned above, investors might wonder if the Federal Reserve will start raising rates again.  Such a pivot is unlikely after the Fed killed off rate-rise expectations at its March meeting. And the latest Reuters poll all but puts to bed any risk of rates will go up this economic cycle, given inflation remains below the Fed’s alarm threshold and unemployment is the lowest in generations.  Before the March rate-pause announcement, a preponderance of economists penciled in one or more increases this year. But that has flipped. A majority of those surveyed April 22-24 see no further tightening through December and more are leaning toward a cut by the end of next year. Indeed, interest rate futures imply Fed Funds will be below the current 2.25-2.50 percent target range by this December.  Recent positive consumer spending and exports data have eased market concerns of a sharp economic slowdown. But inflation probably needs to run hot for a long period to panic policymakers off their wait-and-see course.       (GRAPHIC: Federal funds and the economy - tmsnrt.rs/2DzjTZz) Next week ends three decades of Japan’s Heisei era. Heisei, or Achieving Peace, began in 1989 near the peak of a massive stock market bubble and closes with the country trapped in low growth, no inflation, and negative interest rates. The new era that dawns on May 1 is called Reiwa, meaning Beautiful Harmony. It begins when Crown Prince Naruhito ascends the Chrysanthemum Throne. But do investors really want harmony? What they want to see is a bit of economic growth and inflation  to shake up the status quo.  The Bank of Japan’s stimulus toolkit to revive a long-suffering economy is anything but harmonious and yet it’s set to stay. The central bank confirmed recently rates will stay near zero for a long time. But the coming days may not be harmonious or peaceful for currency markets. A 10-day Golden Week holiday kicks off on April 29 and investors are fretting over the risk of a “flash crash” - a violent currency spasm that can occur in times of thin trading turnover.  The year has already seen two yen spikes and many, including Japan’s housewife-trader brigade - so-called Mrs Watanabes - appear to have bought yen as the holiday approaches. Their short dollar/long yen positions recently reached record highs, stock exchange data showed.  (GRAPHIC: Japan stocks: from Hensei to Reiwa - tmsnrt.rs/2W6a7Fe) Quarterly earnings were supposed to be the worst in Europe in almost three years, but with a third of results in, things are looking a little rosier. Two-thirds of companies’ results have beat expectations, and they point to earnings growth of 4.5 percent year-on-year. Financials have delivered the biggest surprises, according to analysis by Barclays. That might just show how low expectations were. In fact, analysts are still taking a red pen to their estimates. The latest I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv shows analysts on average expect first-quarter earnings-per-share for STOXX 600-listed companies to fall 4.2 percent.

(GRAPHIC: Earnings forecasts - tmsnrt.rs/2DuO2ZF) Sterling has gone into the doldrums amid the Brexit delay and unproductive talks between the UK government and the opposition Labour party on a EU withdrawal deal. The resurgent dollar, meanwhile, has taken 2 percent off the pound in April. It is unlikely the Bank of England will be able to rouse it at its May 2 meeting. Despite robust retail and jobs data of late, the economic picture is gloomy - 2019 growth is likely to be around 1.2 percent, the weakest since 2009, investment is down and Governor Mark Carney says business uncertainty is “through the roof”. Indeed, expectations for an interest rate increase have been  whittled down; Reuters polls forecast rates will not move until early 2020, a calendar quarter later than was forecast a month ago. The hunt for a new governor to replace Carney in October adds more uncertainty to the mix.  The recent run of UK data has fueled hopes of economic rebound. That’s put net hedge fund positions in the pound into positive territory for the first time in nearly a year. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street might temper some of that optimism.

1114,COLUMN-Global economy is close to stalling as trade falls: Kemp - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  12:15 PM / in 11 days","5 Min Read(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2GKTolW By John Kemp LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - World trade volumes are falling for the first time since the end of the financial crisis in a sign the global economy is only one more major shock away from recession. Trade volumes in the three months between December and February were down 0.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). Trade is retreating for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the economy was still being buffeted by aftershocks from the financial crisis (“World trade monitor”, CPB, April 25). South Korea’s KOSPI-100 equity index, dominated by companies heavily exposed to trade, has been signalling a severe slowdown for almost a year now (tmsnrt.rs/2GKTolW). Hong Kong’s International Airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub, reported volumes were down more than 5 percent year-on-year in the first three months of 2019. And containers handled through the U.S. Port of Long Beach, one of the major transhipment hubs for goods between the United States and Asia, were down more than 7 percent in the first quarter. Inside the United States, truck freight growth slowed, and rail freight fell, in the three months from December through February compared with the same period a year earlier. Around the world, manufacturers have reported that export orders have been falling for seven months in a row, the longest slowdown since 2012, according to the JPMorgan global purchasing managers’ survey. So far, the loss of momentum has been felt most strongly in manufacturing and transportation, sectors with heavy international exposure, rather than in more domestically focused services. Bellwethers including 3M Company (diversified manufacturing), Intel (chip manufacturing), Bombardier (rail and aircraft) and UPS (distribution services) all downgraded their outlooks for 2019 on Thursday. Rising interest rates, an appreciating dollar and the escalation of oil prices during 2017 and the first part of 2018 all combined to slow the expansion. But policymakers made the slowdown worse by sowing business uncertainty with the proliferation of tariffs, sanctions and national-security related investment restrictions. The extended shutdown of parts of the U.S. federal government and Britain’s botched Brexit process added to the confusion and uncertainty among businesses. The result has been a hesitation to make risky long-term commitments and a slowdown in capital investment which is now weighing on global growth. The economy is best thought of as a complex system in which positive and negative feedback mechanisms produce oscillations in the rate of expansion (ranging from boom, to steady growth, weak growth and recession). Expansions are characterised by strong positive feedback mechanisms, which ensure once they get going they develop considerable internal momentum (growth fuels more growth). Momentum also helps inoculate the economy against shocks and makes it more likely to weather them without switching into a recession phase. But as the economy’s internal momentum fades, the risk of the system undergoing a phase-change from expansion to contraction increases. The current slowdown has increased the risk one more major shock or policy error will push the global economy from sluggish expansion into outright recession. Recent increases in major equity indices around the world and the very slight steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve suggest investors think the global economy will narrowly avert a recession this year. Investors are betting continued strength in consumer spending and domestically insulated services sectors may be enough to offset weakness in business investment, manufacturing and trade. But the global economy has come uncomfortably close to stalling. For the expansion to continue, everything must now go right, including steady financial conditions, improved business confidence, appropriate fiscal and monetary policy, stable oil prices and pro-growth trade policy. There is not much room for error.

1115,Investors bolster oversight in emerging-market private equity after Abraaj collapse - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  1:00 PM / in 11 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Investors in private equity funds that focus on emerging markets are tightening oversight after the collapse of a Middle East buyout firm, a survey has found. Many investors said they planned to put more money into such  funds over the next two years, but also to install extra checks and balances, suggested the survey by the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association (EMPEA).   Dubai-based Abraaj Capital Ltd had been the largest buyout fund in the Middle East and North Africa until it fell apart last year after a dispute with investors, including the Gates Foundation, over a $1 billion healthcare fund. Two of its top executives have been arrested. “The fallout has prompted many limited partners to expand the scope of their due diligence processes to include a closer look at the internal operations and governance arrangements of fund managers,” EMPEA said. EMPEA surveyed institutions acting as limited partners, including pension funds, funds of funds and development banks, who collectively represent more than $6.9 trillion in total assets under management. Limited partners commit money to funds alongside private equity firms, known as general partners, who invest the fund’s capital in companies. Some Abraaj executives are facing charges in the United States that they defrauded their investors, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  The majority of institutions included in the Global Limited Partners Survey had implemented substantial changes to their due diligence practices, EMPEA said.  Nearly 44 percent of survey respondents had requested extra information from prospective general partners over the last two years. A total of 32 percent had updated their due diligence policies or guidelines. The same number had dedicated additional resources for due diligence, most likely because of the growing workload and specialized skills the process demands. Still, the data suggested the Abraaj crisis has not put investors off private equity in emerging markets. Over half the respondents expected to commit more capital to such funds in the next two years, the first time since 2014 that more than half of the respondents said they plan to raise commitments. The proportion of investors who plan to raise the emerging- market share of their overall private equity portfolios reached its highest level in the last five years, EMPEA said. For the second year in a row, Southeast Asia ranked as the most attractive market in the next 12 months, ahead of India and China.  Russia and former Soviet states, Turkey and the Middle East were the least attractive. Investors cited political risk as the biggest deterrent to investing.  The Middle East’s slide down the rankings followed a year of geopolitical quandaries and questions about the region’s governance standards, partly as a result of the meltdown of Abraaj.

1116,REFILE-FOREX-Euro hovers near 23-month lows as dollar bulls eye U.S. GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  11:19 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min Read(Adds dropped word ‘gained’ in paragraph 4) * Traders wait for U.S. GDP after strong data run * Analysts say Spanish election in focus for euro * Most currencies calm after earlier rise in volatility * Swedish crown, Aussie recover from lows * Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The euro hovered near its weakest level since May 2017 on Friday as traders waited to see whether United States GDP numbers due out later will reinforce signs of economic strength and send the dollar surging even higher. After a small rise in volatility this week - albeit from multi-year lows - currency markets turned calm on Friday, with most major pairs stuck in tight trading ranges. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies inched lower to 98.164 after hitting 98.322 on Thursday, its highest since May 2017. The euro gained marginally to $1.1134. Data at 1230 GMT is expected to show that U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.0 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. That follows strong capital goods numbers on Thursday. “This week’s break in EUR/USD below $1.1200 has largely been a dollar story. Over the next few days, however, focus could return to Europe,” ING analysts wrote in a note to clients, citing Sunday’s Spanish election, an S&P credit rating review of Italian sovereign debt, and possible French economic reforms. Many analysts have been surprised at the strength of the dollar after the Federal Reserve paused its interest rate hiking cycle at the start of 2019. That was followed by other policymakers delaying tightening plans, with the Riksbank the latest to do so on Thursday, sending the Swedish crown to 17-year lows. The crown recovered half a percent versus the dollar on Friday to 9.4955, with similarly sized gains against the euro to 10.5730 crowns . Morgan Stanley analysts said dollar weakness was “delayed but not canceled.” “Nevertheless, economic data suggest that our anticipated USD decline may be delayed by a quarter or even longer should the US administration impose tariffs on European autos in May,” they said. The yen slipped slightly on Friday to 111.77 yen per dollar, after weakening overnight following the Bank of Japan putting a time frame on its forward guidance for the first time. The BoJ investors that it would keep interest rates at super-low levels for at least one more year, in a move aimed at dispelling any doubt over its commitment to ultra-loose policies. The Australian dollar, which this week hit a four-month low as soft inflation data boosted the prospect of a rate cut, rose as much as 0.4 percent to $0.7045. The New Zealand dollar gained half a percent to$0.6659 on increased optimism about the economy. Sterling, hurt this week by dollar strength and concerns Brexit talks between the ruling Conservative and opposition Labour parties had run into the sand, clawed itself back above $1.29.

1117,US STOCKS-Futures flat ahead of GDP data - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  11:34 AM / in 11 days","3 Min Read(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window) * Futures: Dow down 0.13%, S&P off 0.05%, Nasdaq up 0.14% By Sruthi Shankar and Amy Caren Daniel April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat on Friday, as investors paused ahead of GDP data, which is expected to show the world’s largest economy maintained a moderate pace of growth in the first quarter. Gross domestic product probably increased at a 2% annualized rate in the quarter as a burst in exports, strong inventory stockpiling and government investment in public construction projects offset a slowdown in consumer and business spending, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The Commerce Department report will be published at 8:30 a.m. ET. The GDP data comes as investors look for fresh catalysts to push the markets higher. The S&P 500 index is about 0.5% below its record high hit in late September, after surging nearly 17% this year. First-quarter earnings have been largely upbeat, with nearly 78% of the 178 companies that have reported so far surpassing earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv data. Wall Street now expects S&P 500 earnings to be in line with the year-ago quarter, a sharp improvement from the 2.3% fall expected at the start of April. Amazon.com Inc rose 0.9% in premarket trading after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services. Ford Motor Co shares surged 8.5% after the automaker posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market. Mattel Inc jumped 8% after the toymaker beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly revenue, as a more diverse range of Barbie dolls powered sales in the United States. At 6:52 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 35 points, or 0.13%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.5 points, or 0.05% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.75 points, or 0.14%. Among decliners, Intel Corp slumped 7.7% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business. Rival Advanced Micro Devices declined 0.8%. Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are expected to report results later in the day.

1118,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar off 2-year highs ahead of U.S. GDP, shares subdued - Reuters","April 26, 2019 /  11:31 AM / 11 days ago","5 Min Read* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Dollar slips from 23-month highs * US GDP data awaited * Global stocks flat, European markets open mixed * Gold firms 0.4 percent By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The dollar slipped from 23-month highs on Friday ahead of keenly awaited U.S. gross domestic product data for the first quarter, while global shares were on track for a fifth successive weekly gain despite subdued trade. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of peers, was down 0.06 percent on the day, off a nearly two-year high hit on the previous day. The U.S. currency has gained strongly over the past few days as investors expect the U.S. economy to outperform the rest of the developed world. The dollar index is set to end the week 0.7 percent higher. The other big mover in currencies was the Japanese yen, which gained as speculators cut short positions ahead of holidays which will see most Japanese markets shut for six whole trading days. Global stocks were largely flat on the day after subdued trading in Asia. MSCI’s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat but set for its fifth weekly gain on the trot. Most major European bourses opened lower, but turned around by midday trade in London. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.1 percent. Britain’s FTSE was down 0.2 percent. Futures markets indicated a lower open on Wall Street . All eyes were on the U.S. GDP release which will be closely watched after a string of largely resilient data from an economy in its 10th year of expansion. The data will be out at 1230 GMT. A string of solid numbers has led analysts to revise up their forecasts for growth and the latest median polled by Reuters is for an annualised 2.0 percent. The closely-watched estimate of GDP from the Atlanta Federal Reserve is projecting an outcome of 2.7 percent, a huge turnaround from a few weeks ago when it was at 0.5 percent. “Today’s GDP print in the U.S. has become even more important given the recent move higher in the dollar,” said Mohammed Kazmi, portfolio manager at UBP. “The dollar’s strength is beginning to gain investor attention and has led to vulnerable emerging markets such as Argentina and Turkey appearing exposed once again, whilst it also seems to be a headwind for U.S. risk markets in which momentum is stalling, despite decent Q1 earnings thus far.” The GDP release also sets the stage for a Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week, where investors will try to anticipate how the U.S. central bank will react to mostly resilient indicators of late. Yet the rebound has not been mirrored in inflation, which remains subdued across much of the developed world, prompting a host of central banks to turn dovish. Just this week central banks in Sweden and Canada have backed off plans to tighten, while the Bank of Japan tried to dispel doubts about its accommodative stance by pledging to keep rates at super-low levels for at least one more year. European Central Bank Vice-President Luis de Guindos on Thursday opened the door to more money-printing if needed to boost inflation in the euro zone. Rate cuts look much likelier in Australia and New Zealand after recent disappointingly weak inflation reports. The Federal Reserve holds a policy meeting next week and is expected to reaffirm its patient stance. A Reuters poll of analysts published on Thursday found most believed the Fed was done with tightening altogether. Major depreciate when the global economy improves and also when global investors become more risk-averse,” said UBS strategists in central banks are done tightening policy, according to a majority of economists polled by Reuters, with the growth outlook wilting across developed and emerging economies along with scant prospects for a surge in inflation. “We think the dollar is likely to a research note, in a break with what they said was the dollar’s traditional outperformance when the U.S. economy outperforms its peers or when global risk aversion drives investors to the safety of U.S. assets. Reasons they cited were the Fed having more room to cut rates than its global peers and an acceleration in global growth that might allow those peers to tighten policy, thereby closing the interest rate gap. “Only a benign environment where global central banks tread water and yield differentials remain static (i.e. the status quo) would be U.S. dollar-supportive.” Elsewhere in currencies, the euro was off 1 percent for the week as euro zone economic figures continued to disappoint, though it was 0.04 percent higher on the day at $1.1135. In commodity markets, spot gold was 0.3 percent firmer at $1,280.48 per ounce. Oil prices fell on Friday as the market retreated slightly from its strongest bull run in at least a year amid efforts to resume Russian oil flows that were interrupted by contamination.

1119,Hammond optimistic of finding Brexit compromise with Corbyn's Labour - Reuters,"April 26, 2019 /  11:10 AM / 11 days ago","3 Min ReadBEIJING (Reuters) - Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Friday that he was hopeful of clinching a Brexit compromise with the Labour Party to allow the ratification of Prime Minister Theresa May’s thrice-defeated divorce deal.  The United Kingdom was due to have left the EU on March 29, though May has been unable to get her divorce deal approved by parliament. It is now unclear when, how and even if Brexit will happen but the current deadline for leaving is Oct. 31. May’s government is trying to convince the Labour Party to back her deal but Labour wants to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU and has been discussing the idea of holding a confirmatory referendum on any deal they agree. “I’m optimistic that we will find common ground,” Hammond told Reuters in a pooled interview on the sidelines of a summit on China’s Belt and Road initiative in Beijing.  “I had a very constructive meeting with my Labour counterpart literally just before I went to the airport and got on a plane to come here on Wednesday. And there are further meetings going on in London right now.” Hammond denied that talks with Labour had stalled. “There is a national interest imperative that we find a way through which allows Parliament to agree to support a deal, which will allow us to deliver Brexit while protecting the British economy, British businesses and British jobs,” he said. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday he would opt to leave the EU without a deal if he was faced with a choice between a no-deal Brexit or not leaving the bloc at all. Hammond said a no deal would hurt the British economy. “If we were to have a no deal Brexit that would inflict serious short term turbulence on our economy and long term damage, reducing Britain’s growth level and reducing the living standards of the British people. So I absolutely do not favour a no deal exit,” he said.   “We need to leave with a deal and we’ve put the deal to Parliament three times now but unfortunately Parliament has not been able to agree that deal,” Hammond said.

1121,Cohen: Trump feared audit if he released tax returns - Reuters,"February 27, 2019 /  9:54 PM / 2 months ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said on Wednesday that Trump has not released his tax returns because he feared that public scrutiny would lead to an audit and tax penalties. In congressional testimony that could aid efforts by House Democrats to obtain Trump’s returns, Cohen also said he does not believe the president is under audit, despite repeated claims by Trump that he could not release his returns because they are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Members of the House of Representatives tax committee also  pointed to other segments of Cohen’s testimony as topics likely to draw further scrutiny, including claims that Trump deflated the value of his properties to lower his tax bill and called the government “stupid” for giving him a $10 million tax refund in 2008.     As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump broke with a decades old practice of making his tax returns public and continues to refuse to release them as president.   “What he didn’t want is to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces, and then he’ll end up in an audit and he’ll ultimately have taxable consequences, penalties and so on,” Cohen told the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee. “I presume that he is not under audit,” he added.      Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, the tax oversight panel that plans to request Trump’s returns from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has considered focusing on the IRS audits that Trump cites as the reason for not releasing the documents. Democrats are trying to back up their looming request with an iron-clad legal argument for what is expected to be an unprecedented court battle. But Republicans say that obtaining Trump’s returns would “weaponize” the confidential tax documents for political purposes. “This is about an abuse of power by Congress,” Representative Kevin Brady, the committee’s top Republican, said earlier this month.   But Democratic committee members on Wednesday said they were struck by Cohen’s remarks about Trump receiving a multimillion-dollar refund from the IRS after slashing wages for his employees. “That is of concern. Because that means there’s potential cheating on his taxes,” said Democratic Representative Judy Chu. Cohen said Trump was able to lower real estate tax bills by deflating the value of his golf courses and requesting a tax deduction.  “There are three or four things of a financial nature that Ways and Means could be interested in and that the IRS should be looking into,” Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell said.

1122,Donald Trump Jr. signed checks for hush money related to affair: Cohen - Reuters,"February 27, 2019 /  3:36 PM / 2 months ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress on Wednesday that some reimbursement checks issued to him for hush-money payments to an adult film star were signed by Donald Trump Jr. and the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer. Cohen said Donald Trump himself, while president, signed a $35,000 check tmsnrt.rs/2BPKgcL while he was president to repay him for ""hush money I paid on his behalf,"" Cohen told a House of Representatives committee.  ""Other checks tmsnrt.rs/2BVqSeh to reimburse me for the hush money payments were signed by Don Jr. and Allen Weisselberg,"" he said, referring to the president's son and the Trump Organization CFO.   Cohen’s testimony raises the possibility that Donald Trump Jr. could be prosecuted for violating campaign finance laws, depending on whether he knew what the payments were intended for, said lawyer Andy Wright, who served as associate counsel to President Barack Obama.  Alan Futerfas, a lawyer for Trump Jr. and the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests for comment.  Cohen pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations relating to arranging payments to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, and to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to maintain silence about their affairs with Trump ahead of the 2016 presidential election.     On Wednesday, Cohen said Trump directed him to use his own funds from a home equity line of credit to pay Clifford to avoid any money being traced back to Trump. He said he was going to jail, in part, because of his decision “to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later.”  Although the checks were supposedly part of a retainer agreement, Cohen said there was no such agreement. He said that Weisselberg knew all about the deal, while Donald Trump Jr. would have “cursory information.”  At another point, he said Weisselberg’s signature was on the checks with either Donald Trump Jr. or Eric Trump, another son. When asked whether Donald Trump Jr. and Weisselberg were part of a criminal conspiracy of financial fraud directed by Trump, Cohen answered “yes.” When pressed, he said he could not comment further because the matter might be part of an ongoing investigation. Asked about Cohen’s allegations of a criminal conspiracy, Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for Trump, responded: “Garbage.”  Weisselberg received grand jury immunity during the Cohen prosecution, Reuters has reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. A lawyer for Weisselberg declined to comment on Cohen’s testimony.  A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Cohen, declined to comment on whether Donald Trump Jr. could be charged with campaign finance violations.  It depends “on what Donald Trump Jr. knew about what he was paying for and when,” Wright said. He added that the president’s son could be an accomplice after the fact, or part of the original scheme to engage in hush-money payments.  Cornell law professor Jens David Ohlin noted it was likely the Trump Organization chief financial officer had already told prosecutors about the involvement of Donald Trump Jr. “Weisselberg would probably be the one to say what Don Jr knew or didn’t know when he was signing that check,” Ohlin said. Trump may not be prosecuted because of Justice Department policy to not indict a sitting president.  Reporting by Karen Freifeld and Nathan Layne Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu.

The remark from Cohen, who once said he would “take a bullet” for Trump but has since turned on his former boss, came in his closing comments. He said his concern about the 2020 transition was “why I agreed to appear before you today.” He added, “I have acknowledged I have made my own mistakes and I have owned up to them publicly and under oath, but silence and complicity in the face of the daily destruction of our basic norms and civility to one another will not be one of them. “I did things and I acted improperly, at times at Mr. Trump’s behest. I blindly followed his demands. My loyalty to Mr. Trump has cost me everything: my family’s happiness, friendships, my law license, my company, my livelihood, my honor, my reputation and soon my freedom. And I will not sit back, say nothing, and allow him to do the same to the country.” Reporting by Ginger Gibson, Doina Chiacu and Sarah N.
