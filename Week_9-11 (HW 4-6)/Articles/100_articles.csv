0,Egypt non-oil private-sector activity expands for first time in 8 months -PMI - Reuters,"May 5, 2019 /  4:16 AM / Updated 3 hours ago","3 Min ReadCAIRO, May 5 (Reuters) - Egypt’s non-oil private-sector activity expanded for the first time in eight months in April, and saw its highest reading since August 2015, a survey showed on Sunday. The Emirates NBD Egypt Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the non-oil private sector strengthened to 50.8 in April from 49.9 in March, breaching the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time since August last year. The April reading was the highest in over three-and-a-half years, and only the sixth reading in positive territory since. Analysts linked the improved overall business conditions largely to “greater market movement and an increase in demand,” the PMI report said. A sub-index for output also returned to expansion, rising to 51.1 in April from 49.9 in March. The upswing came after last month’s significant rise of over three points, reaching its highest since August. “The improvement from the first quarter – the PMI index averaged just 48.9 over January to March – was broad-based, with most of the index’s subcomponents returning positive 50-plus readings,” said Daniel Richards, MENA economist at Emirates NBD. The output sub-index was positive for the first time since November 2017 “as firms noticed stronger demand, and a positive reading for new orders for the second month in a row bodes well for this continuing over subsequent readings,” Richards said. New exports orders remained in contractionary territory, though rose to 48.9 in April from 46.8 in March. It was the slowest contraction since December. “Some firms noted a lack of new foreign contracts and a shift in focus towards domestic sales,” the report said, while “others saw higher demand from new markets such as Italy, Turkey and Japan.” Future output sentiment improved from March, and saw its second-highest reading in 12 months. Companies said “new projects, increased tourism and expansion into new foreign markets are likely to boost business activity,” the report said. “With input prices increasing at a faster rate than seen in March, firms’ margins will be squeezed by ongoing price discounting,” Richards said. “Nevertheless, they appear to be more confident with regards (to) future conditions”. “This greater optimism is reflected in their hiring, as employment returned a reading above 50.0 – albeit marginally – for the first time since 2015.” (Reporting by Yousef Saba Editing by Ros Russell)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1,Elliott wants Whitbread to offload chunks of its property portfolio: Sunday Telegraph - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  10:31 PM / Updated 9 hours ago","2 Min Read(Reuters) - Elliott Advisors has become increasingly frustrated with Whitbread Plc’s strategy of owning Premier Inn hotels outright and wants the company to offload chunks of its 5.8 billion pound ($7.64 billion) property portfolio, the Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the report on Saturday, the activist investor believes Whitbread’s strategy is “depressing” the company’s share price and is leaving it open to a cut-price hostile takeover. Citing city sources, the newspaper said Elliott wanted Whitbread to sell 10 to 15 percent of its hotel portfolio and “continue to be open minded about the rest”. The shareholder is also keen for Whitbread to bolster its board with directors having hotel industry experience, the Sunday Telegraph reported, adding that the company was searching for board members with experience of operating hotels in continental Europe. Last August, Whitbread agreed to sell its almost 4,000 Costa coffee shops to Coca-Cola Co for $5.1 billion after pressure from hedge funds, including activist investor Elliott, which said the coffee chain was held back by being grouped with the Premier Inn hotel chain. Whitbread and Elliott advisors did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the report.

2,"Warren Buffett defends Kraft, says Wells Fargo made 'big mistakes' - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  5:13 AM / Updated 10 hours ago","6 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday signaled his commitment to Kraft Heinz Co and defended his actions toward Wells Fargo & Co, two of the largest investments at his Berkshire Hathaway Inc, despite mistakes at both that have caused many investors to sour on them. Buffett, 88, spoke before tens of thousands of people in Omaha, Nebraska, where the Berkshire Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, fielded more than 50 shareholder and analyst questions for six hours at the centerpiece of a weekend of events. Kraft Heinz has been a thorn for Berkshire, which in February took a $3 billion writedown on its 26.7 percent stake, because of the packaged food company’s inability to keep up with changing consumer tastes and reliance on older brands such as Oscar Mayer and Jell-O. The company was created from the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, the latter of which had been owned by Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital, which runs Kraft Heinz day-to-day. Buffett defended 3G’s management, saying the combined company is doing well operationally, and that its current problems cannot be blamed on a lack of investment. But he also maintained that “we paid too much money” for Kraft. “You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much,” he said, while adding it was “not inconceivable” Berkshire could partner with 3G again on a transaction. He said 3G had more willingness to take on leverage and “pay up,” but in many cases also had “way better operators.” Buffett, who became famous in 1991 for criticizing Salomon Inc’s practices and becoming interim chairman to right the mess, also faced a question about his relative silence about Wells Fargo, where Berkshire owns a nearly 10-percent stake. Wells Fargo has spent more than 2-1/2 years addressing fallout from mistreating its customers, including by creating fake accounts, losing two chief executives in the process, including Tim Sloan in March. Buffett repeated that Wells Fargo “made some big mistakes” in its sales practices, and that “when you find a problem, you have to do something about it.” He also said chief executives who make big mistakes shouldn’t walk away with their wealth. But many questionable Wells Fargo practices long predated Sloan’s becoming chief executive, and Buffett and Munger have defended him. “I don’t think people ought to go to jail for honest errors of judgment,” Munger said, calling Sloan an “accidental casualty.” Berkshire also reported on Saturday that operating income, a measure of Berkshire’s business performance, rose 5 percent, helped by the Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad, though it fell just shy of analyst forecasts. Results excluded Kraft Heinz because that company has not released its own quarterly results, Buffett said. Berkshire also repurchased $1.7 billion of stock, reflecting Buffett’s difficulty in finding better uses for the company’s $114.2 billion cash hoard. Buffett acknowledged he would be willing to repurchase $100 billion of stock if it became cheap enough, and Munger predicted Berkshire would become “more liberal” with buybacks. “This much cash is certainly a drag” for Buffett, said Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners LLC in Memphis. “He and Charlie are certainly open that they missed it on several great businesses for many years. The purchases of Apple and Amazon are a good sign.” Berkshire owns more than $50 billion of Apple Inc stock, and Buffett said one of Berkshire’s portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, has invested in Amazon.com Inc. Munger also lamented Berkshire’s failure to invest in Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, saying “I feel like a horse’s ass for not identifying Google earlier.” Berkshire’s more than 90 businesses and roughly 389,000 employees make the company a barometer for the U.S. economy, and a report card for one of the world’s most revered investors. The shareholder weekend is not all business. Buffett on Saturday morning made his usual slow-motion crawl, with a crowd of photographers in tow, through an exhibit hall where shareholders could buy Berkshire-owned products, including 20,000 pounds of See’s candies and 28,752 Dairy Queen bars. “We love you Warren,” shareholders shouted as Buffett nibbled a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. People lined up before midnight to get early access to the best seats at the arena, which opened at 7 a.m. Daphne Kalir-Starr, 9, a fourth-grader from New York City, lined up with her father at 11 p.m. on Friday night, along with her sleeping bag. It’s her third time to see Buffett. “I really like hearing from great investors,” she said. “Even though he wasn’t really recognized at the beginning, he kept working at it.” Bela Chowdhury, 49, came from Kolkata, India, with other students from a nonprofit group that promotes financial literacy for women. “He is the ultimate guru,” she said. Meanwhile, Luke On, a University of Toronto finance undergraduate, said he lined up at 10 p.m. on Friday. “I have no place to stay and wanted to save money, but I wanted to see Warren and Charlie,” he said.

4,Warren Buffett: Berkshire discloses enough about itself - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  8:39 PM / Updated 10 hours ago","2 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb., May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday rejected a frequent criticism that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc does not disclose enough about its more than 90, often large operating businesses or its common stock investments. Buffett defended Berkshire’s disclosures in responding to three questions at Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Meyer Shields, of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, is among the critics of Berkshire’s disclosures, saying in an April 28 report they leave investors “disproportionately reliant” on Buffett’s public persona and past investment successes rather than actual knowledge about the company. Berkshire owns or co-owns several companies, such as the BNSF railroad, large enough to be in the Fortune 500 on their own, yet which merit no more than a couple of pages in its quarterly and annual reports. Profit and revenue for many smaller units are not disclosed at all. Buffett said “I don’t think we actually provide less information” in periodic reports, but may present it in a different form. He insisted that overwhelming investors with technical information was the wrong idea, saying you can “lose people” in a 300-page report that says less than a 50-page report. Buffett also said Berkshire did not need to know the reasoning beyond its investments in stocks generally and foreign stocks, saying it might require the disclosure of proprietary strategies or would not be legally required.

7,"HIGHLIGHTS-Wit and wisdom of Warren Buffett, the 'Oracle of Omaha' - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  3:29 PM / in 13 hours","5 Min Read(Adds comments on Apple, 3G Capital and Google) NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, the 88-year-old chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, is taking hours of questions from investors, analysts and journalists at the conglomerate’s annual shareholder meeting on Saturday. Buffett’s marathon Q&A session is part of what the billionaire investor calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” the annual shareholder weekend for his company. Below are some of Buffett’s comments, and those of Berkshire’s Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, on a wide range of topics. “I like our Apple holdings very much,” Buffett said on Apple being Berkshire’s largest holding, declining to discuss expectations about the company. Munger added: “In my family, the people who have Apple phones, it’s the last thing they’ll give up.” “They have more of a taste of leverage than we do… but they also ... in certain types of situations ... would be way better operators,” Buffett said. Buffett called Jorge Paulo Lemann, co-founder of Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, “a good friend of mine and marvelous human being.” Munger said not buying shares of Google was a big mistake. “We just sat there sucking our thumbs,” Munger said. “We’re ashamed.” “Amazon itself has become a brand. Kirkland is now a brand doing $39 billion. Kirkland does more business than Coke does. Certain retail systems have gained some power, and particularly in the case of Amazon and Walmart and Costco, have gained in power relative to brands.” “Kraft-Heinz is still doing very well operationally, but we paid too much.” Buffett added: “You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much. What you can’t do is turn something into a good deal by paying little.” “I’m a card-carrying capitalist. I believe we wouldn’t be sitting here except for the market system and the rule of law ... that are embodied in this country. So you don’t have to worry about me changing in that manner.” “The people making the decision on (buying) Amazon are absolutely value investors. That has not changed. They are following value principles. They are smart. They are totally committed to Berkshire. I don’t second-guess them.” “The considerations are identical when you buy Amazon versus some bank stock that looks cheap statistically.” “The new GAAP rules .... require that we mark our securities to market and report any unrealized gains. The bottom line figures are going to be totally capricious. “I really regard these bottom line figures ... as potentially being harmful to our shareholders and really not being helpful. Focus on what we call our operating earnings, which were up a bit.” “The question whether we had a $100 billion or $200 would not make a difference in our approach to repurchase shares. We used to have a policy of tying to book value, but that became ... obsolete.” “We could do it (buy back $100 billion of Berkshire stock). We will spend a lot of money. We’ve been involved in companies where the number of shares has been reduced 70-80 percent over time. “If our stock gets cheap relative to intrinsic value, we will not hesitate. We would certainly be willing to spend $100 billion.” Berkshire will “probably be more liberal when it comes to repurchasing shares.” “Wells made some big mistakes in what they incentivized. The interesting thing is the extent to which they set up fake accounts, couple million of them that had no balance in them, that could not possibly have been profitable to Wells.” “When you find a problem, you have to do something about it. I think that’s probably where they made a mistake.” “Wells has become Exhibit One. Go back a few years, there’s quite a list of banks where people have behaved badly.” ON HIS 60-YEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH MUNGER “We make the big decisions jointly. It’s just that we haven’t had any big decisions.” Compiled by Nick Zieminski and Jennifer Ablan in New York;

9,Erdogan signals he backs re-run of contested Istanbul vote - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  12:53 PM / Updated 15 hours ago","4 Min ReadANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan signaled on Saturday he backs a re-run of mayoral elections in Istanbul which resulted in a narrow victory for the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) for the first time in 25 years. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party (AKP), which also lost control of the capital Ankara in the March 31 local elections, has already filed an appeal to Turkey’s High Election Board (YSK) to annul and re-run the election in Istanbul due to what it says were irregularities. The YSK is expected to rule on the AKP challenge on Monday, but it has ordered district electoral officials in Istanbul to investigate their respective ballot box officials in its interim rulings.  Prosecutors on Thursday launched probes into allegations of irregularities in Istanbul and summoned more than 100 polling station officials for questioning as suspects, in a move the opposition CHP said would not alter the results of the vote. Speaking to Turkish businesspeople in Istanbul, Erdogan said the Istanbul elections were marred by irregularities and called on the YSK to make a decision that would eliminate controversies and “clear its name”. “My people tell me the elections should be renewed. I have not spoken until now, I’ve been silent. But everyone else has spoken. Enough already,” Erdogan said. “There is a controversy here, it’s clear. There is an irregularity here, that’s clear too. Let’s go to the people and see what they say and whatever the outcome, we will accept it.”  Erdogan had accused the opposition of supporting “terrorism” and labeled the local election a “matter of survival” for Turkey during his campaign, which was held amid growing disenchantment among voters over economic woes. CHP spokesman Faik Oztrak told reporters later on Saturday that it was time for Erdogan and his AKP to accept defeat. “The real matter of survival here is those who put aside the people’s concerns about food prices, wages and focus instead on their own benefits,” Oztrak told a news conference in Ankara. “There is only one thing that can clear the YSK. That is for it to act in line with its regulations and previous rulings.” The uncertainty over the results in Istanbul, which accounts for around a third of the country’s economy, has kept financial markets on edge, as Turkey tries to recover from a currency crisis that saw the lira lose more than 30 percent of its value last year. On Friday, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said the Istanbul elections had become a test of democracy. He accused the AKP of exerting political pressure on the YSK to order a re-run of the vote. Erdogan said his party was only exercising its legal rights. “Claiming that Tayyip Erdogan is trying to steal an election he has no right to is the biggest insult,” Erdogan said. “We are not hurling threats, we’re just waiting.” While the CHP’s Ekrem Imamoglu took office as Istanbul’s new mayor last month, the AKP won 25 of the city’s 39 districts and the majority of seats in the municipal council. It has said that this proved irregularities had taken place. Speaking to his supporters on Saturday, Imamoglu said the AKP appeals were unreasonable. “So the 25 districts are all clean, the municipal council votes are perfect, but when it comes to the mayorship, there is an irregularity. We can only laugh at this,” Imamoglu said. Reporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu; Editing by Gareth Jones and Ros RussellAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

10,"Trump says he, Putin discussed new nuclear pact possibly including China - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  4:03 PM / Updated 12 hours ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday the possibility of a new accord limiting nuclear arms that could eventually include China in what would be a major deal between the globe’s top three atomic powers. Trump, speaking to reporters as he met in the Oval Office with Peter Pellegrini, prime minister of the Slovak Republic, also said he and Putin discussed efforts to persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, the political discord in Venezuela, and Ukraine during a call that stretched over an hour. The 2011 New START treaty, the only U.S.-Russia arms control pact limiting deployed strategic nuclear weapons, expires in February 2021 but can be extended for five years if both sides agree. Without the agreement, it could be harder to gauge each other’s intentions, arms control advocates say. Trump cited the expense of keeping up the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a motivating factor behind wanting to limit how many weapons are deployed. “We’re talking about a nuclear agreement where we make less and they make less and maybe where we get rid of some of the tremendous firepower that we have right now,” he said. Trump said China during trade talks had “felt very strongly” about joining the United States and Russia in limiting nuclear weapons. “So I think we’re going to probably start up something very shortly between Russia and ourselves maybe to start off, and I think China will be added down the road. We’ll be talking about non-proliferation, we’ll be talking about a nuclear deal of some kind, and I think it’ll be a very comprehensive one,” he said. The New START treaty required the United States and Russia to cut their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades, and limit delivery systems - land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. It also includes extensive transparency measures requiring each side to allow the other to carry out 10 inspections of strategic nuclear bases each year; give 48 hours notice before new missiles covered by the treaty leave their factories; and provide notifications before ballistic missile launches. Trump has called the New START treaty concluded by his predecessor, Barack Obama, a “bad deal” and “one-sided.” The Kremlin said the two sides confirmed they intended to “activate dialogue in various spheres, including strategic security.” The two men, who last chatted informally at a dinner of world leaders in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1, briefly talked about the report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller that concluded Trump did not collude with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. Putin seemed amused, said Trump. “He said something to the effect that it started off as a mountain, and it ended up being a mouse. But he knew that because he knew there was no collusion whatsoever. Pretty much that’s what it was,” he said. The Kremlin said the call was initiated by Washington. It said the two leaders agreed to maintain contacts on different levels and expressed satisfaction with the “businesslike and constructive nature” of the conversation. With the United States concerned about a Russian military presence in Venezuela at a time when Washington wants Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to leave power, Trump told Putin “the United States stands with the people of Venezuela” and stressed he wanted to get relief supplies into the country, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Putin told Trump that any external interference in Venezuela’s internal business undermines the prospects of a political end to the crisis, the Kremlin said. The two leaders discussed Ukraine. Trump canceled a summit meeting with Putin late last year after Russia seized three Ukrainian Navy ships on Nov. 25 and arrested 24 sailors. Putin also told Trump that the new leadership in Ukraine should take steps to solve the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin said. Trump also raised with Putin the issue of getting North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Trump has met twice with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but Kim has yet to agree to a disarmament deal. Sanders said Trump mentioned several times “the need and importance of Russia stepping up and continuing to put pressure on North Korea to denuclearize.” The Kremlin said both leaders highlighted the need to pursue denuclearization of the region. During an April summit with Kim in Vladivostok, Putin expressed Russian support for a gradual process of trading disarmament for sanctions relief.

11,House Democrats seek to intervene against Trump lawsuit over bank subpoenas - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:55 PM / a day ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Two committees of the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked to intervene in a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization seeking to block House subpoenas seeking financial records from Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, the Committee on Financial Services and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said they needed to intervene in the lawsuit in order to “defend their significant interests in the enforcement of their subpoenas” as part of “investigations on issues of national significance.”  In a separate filing on Friday, Trump, his children and his company asked U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos for a preliminary order blocking the banks from responding to the subpoenas while their lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, is pending. They said they will suffer “irreparable harm” without such an order, and that the subpoenas appeared to be intended to expose their confidential financial information “for the sake of exposure.” “That purpose is illegitimate and provides no constitutional footing for the subpoenas,” they said. Deutsche Bank has long been one of the main banks for Trump’s real estate empire. A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank. Democratic lawmakers had asked Capital One’s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump’s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests.   In their lawsuit, Trump, a Republican, and the other plaintiffs accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose in hopes they would “stumble upon something” they could use as a political weapon against Trump. Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Trump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and has said “we’re fighting all the subpoenas” issued by the House. The White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump’s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators.

12,Pressure grows on Attorney General Barr over Mueller - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:29 PM / in a day","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and a senior U.S. House Democrat tightened the screws on U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday over the Mueller report, making new demands on him after an already tough week for the Justice Department chief. Trump said it will be up to Barr to decide whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller, author of the report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which wants to hear from him. Earlier in the day, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler set a new deadline of Monday at 9 a.m. for Barr to comply with a subpoena seeking an unredacted version of the report before moving to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. The two developments ensured that Barr, Mueller and his report will remain in sharp focus next week in Washington, where Congress and Trump are on a collision course over investigations being led by Nadler and other committee leaders. At the White House, speaking to reporters, Trump was asked whether he would let Mueller testify to the Senate panel. The president responded, “That’s up to our attorney general.” Barr, who was appointed by Trump, testified on Wednesday for four hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He took heavy criticism for it from congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of misrepresenting the findings of Mueller’s much-anticipated two-year investigation. The same committee now wants to talk to Mueller. His 448-page report unearthed many links between Russians and Trump’s campaign, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow. It also described attempts by Trump to obstruct Mueller’s probe, but did not say whether Trump had committed a crime.    Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, wrote to Mueller to ask whether he wanted to appear before his panel to discuss any misstatements Barr may have made about the special counsel’s investigation. The special counsel’s office would not comment on Graham’s invitation. In a letter to Barr, House Judiciary Chairman Nadler set the 9 a.m. Monday deadline for Barr to comply with the subpoena demanding the unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence from the Mueller probe. He also offered to negotiate further to gain the Justice Department’s cooperation, but made clear what would be at stake if Barr refused. “If the department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena, the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse,” the New York Democrat wrote. The Justice Department declined to comment. Barr on April 18 released a redacted version of the Mueller report. Nadler subpoenaed the entire document a day later. If Barr does not comply, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to move forward on Monday with a contempt citation that could ultimately lead to a civil court case against Barr, followed by fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply. Also on Friday, Trump said he will decide in coming days whether he will let former White House lawyer Don McGahn testify to Congress. Mueller’s report said McGahn told investigators that Trump contacted him in an attempt to get Mueller fired.

15,Iran to keep enriching uranium despite U.S. move: parliament speaker - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  6:14 AM / Updated 15 hours ago","4 Min ReadDUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will continue with low-level uranium enrichment in line with its nuclear deal with world powers, Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani was quoted as saying on Saturday, despite a U.S. move to stop it. Washington acted on Friday to force Iran to stop producing low-enriched uranium and expanding its only nuclear power plant, intensifying a campaign aimed at halting Tehran’s ballistic missile program and curbing its regional power. “Under the (nuclear accord) Iran can produce heavy water, and this is not in violation of the agreement. Therefore we will carry on with enrichment activity,” the semi-official news agency ISNA quoted Larijani as saying. The Fars agency carried a similar report. Heavy water can be employed in reactors to produce plutonium, a fuel used in nuclear warheads. The United States also scrapped its sanctions waiver that had allowed Iran to evade a 300-kg limit on the amount of low-enriched uranium it can store under the nuclear deal at its main nuclear facility of Natanz. Washington said the move was aimed at forcing Tehran to end its production of low-enriched uranium, a demand Iran has repeatedly rejected as it says it uses the uranium to help produce electricity. Until now, Iran was allowed to ship low-enriched uranium produced at Natanz to Russia before it hit the 300-kg limit, an expert said. The United States also said it would no longer waive sanctions that allowed Iran to ship to Oman for storage heavy water produced at its Arak facility beyond a 300-tonne limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal. A senior parliamentarian called for talks with Iran’s partners in the nuclear deal and the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure Iran could continue to enrich uranium, ISNA reported. “With new sanctions, America wants to slow Iran’s nuclear industry, so new talks should be held with nuclear deal members and the IAEA to approve that Iran can enrich fuel to 20 percent and higher,” Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, head of parliament’s national security committee, was quoted as saying by ISNA. Separately, President Hassan Rouhani said live on television on Saturday that Iran must counter U.S. sanctions by continuing to export its oil as well as boosting non-oil exports. “America is trying to decrease our foreign reserves ... So we have to increase our hard currency income and cut our currency expenditures,” Rouhani said. “Last year, we had we non-oil exports of $43 billion. We should increase production and raise our (non-oil) exports and resist America’s plots against the sale of our oil.”  Friday’s U.S. move, which Rouhani made no direct reference to, was the third punitive action Washington has taken against Iran in as many weeks. Last week, it said it would stop waivers for countries buying Iranian oil, in an attempt to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. It also blacklisted Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Trump administration’s efforts to impose political and economic isolation on Tehran began last year when it unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear deal it and other world powers negotiated with Iran in 2015.

16,Berkshire swings to big profit; Buffett laments Kraft Heinz - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  12:30 PM / Updated 15 hours ago","3 Min ReadOMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said gains in its stock investments fueled a big first-quarter profit, while improved results from its Geico auto insurer and BNSF railroad units boosted operating results. Berkshire also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its stock in the quarter, reflecting Buffett’s troubles to find better uses for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate’s cash hoard, which now totals $114.2 billion. Results were released as Buffett, 88, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 95, prepared to answer more than five hours of questions from shareholders and analysts at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which draws tens of thousands of people. The $21.66-billion overall profit, or $13,209 per Class A share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $1.14 billion, or $692 per share, and a fourth-quarter net loss of $25.39 billion. These results illustrate what Buffett has called the “wild and capricious” and, in his view, meaningless swings caused by an accounting rule requiring the reporting of unrealized stock gains with earnings, regardless of Berkshire’s plans to sell. Berkshire had $15.1 billion of these gains in the first quarter. Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 5 percent to $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per Class A share, from $5.29 billion, or $3,215 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,399 per Class A share, according to Refinitiv data. Results excluded operating earnings tied to Berkshire’s 26.7 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co because the food company has not released its own audited quarterly results, Buffett told reporters before the annual meeting. Buffett also maintained that “we paid too much” for Kraft Heinz, which was created in a 2015 merger between Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, which Berkshire and Brazil’s 3G Capital controlled. In last year’s fourth quarter, Berkshire took a $3-billion writedown on Kraft. Geico saw pre-tax underwriting profit rise 14 percent as rising rates and premiums offset higher accident claims. BNSF’s profit rose 9 percent to $1.25 billion as higher demand from the energy and industrial sectors offset lower volumes attributed to severe winter weather and flooding. Among other businesses, the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit posted a 3-percent profit increase, while earnings from retailing and services units increased 16 percent, despite a 19 percent revenue drop at See’s Candies because Easter fell late. Berkshire owns more than 90 companies.     Last month, Berkshire committed $10 billion to Occidental Petroleum Corp’s cash-and-stock bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which Chevron Corp also wants to buy. The Berkshire investment is contingent on Occidental completing its proposed purchase of Anadarko. Berkshire’s Class A shares closed Friday at $327,765.61, and its Class B shares closed at $218.60.

18,"South Africa's largest opposition party promises to lead coalitions, tackle racism - Reuters","May 4, 2019 /  12:41 PM / Updated 18 hours ago","3 Min ReadJOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), although heading for defeat in May 8 national elections, pledged to forge coalitions with smaller parties to break the dominance of the ruling ANC, especially at the local level. South Africans vote for a sixth time since the end of apartheid in 1994, and while an all-out victory for the ruling African National Congress is almost certain, the margin of its majority is set to drop following a decade of weak economic growth and a rise in racial tensions. At the DA’s final campaign rally on Saturday, Mmusi Maimane, the first black African to lead the center-right party, told 5,000 supporters in the township of Soweto the DA would grow jobs, protect minority rights and unite the country. “You will find us at the heart of coalition governments in this country, as we build a strong center for South Africa, free from the divisions of the past,” Maimane said. Parliamentary and provincial elections take place every five years, with seats allocated according to a proportional representation system. The DA and the hard left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) teamed up in 2016 local elections to clinch control in three of the country’s largest metropolitan districts - South Africa’s economic hub Johannesburg, administrative capital Pretoria and Nelson Mandela Bay in the eastern province. But the parties have been at odds since, disagreeing over key laws at national and local level, particularly land reform.  The DA rejected a move to amend the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation after the EFF brought the motion to parliament, and eventually saw it passed with the support of the ANC. Polls in the past two weeks suggest the DA, as well as the ANC, will struggle to win outright majorities in crucial urban areas.  “The smaller parties pose somewhat of a threat to the dominant ones this year. New parties, many launched by former ANC and DA members, will siphon away votes and could be key in provincial coalitions,” political risk organization Eurasia said in a note.  The DA won 22 percent of the parliamentary vote in 2014, giving it the second biggest number of seats in the National Assembly. Analysts also say a sharper fracturing of voters along racial and ideological lines has seen smaller, more hardline parties gain traction. “Your vote should not simply there to expression your race,” Maimane said.   “If the rights of the minority are going to protected they are going to be protected by the majority,” he said, responding to a growing challenge by smaller nationalist groups to the party’s traditional base of white, English and Afrikaans-speaking middle class voters.

25,Exclusive: Foreign government leases at Trump World Tower stir more emoluments concerns - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  10:09 AM / 2 days ago","11 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department allowed seven foreign governments to rent luxury condominiums in New York’s Trump World Tower in 2017 without approval from Congress, according to documents and people familiar with the leases, in what some experts say could be a potential violation of the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause. The Manhattan building, part of the real estate empire of Donald Trump, had housed diplomats and foreign officials before the property developer became president. But now that he is in the White House, such transactions must be approved by federal lawmakers, some legal experts say. The emoluments clause bans U.S. officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional consent. The rental transactions, dating from the early months of Trump’s presidency and first disclosed by Reuters, could add to mounting scrutiny of his business dealings with foreign governments, which are now the subject of multiple lawsuits. Congressional staffers confirmed to Reuters that the Trump World Tower lease requests were never submitted to Congress. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said his committee has been “stonewalled” in its efforts to obtain detailed  information about foreign government payments to Trump’s businesses. “This new information raises serious questions about the President and his businesses’ potential receipt of payments from foreign governments,” Cummings said in a statement to Reuters. “The American public deserves full transparency.” A State Department spokesperson referred Reuters to the Justice Department because the subject involved “matters related to ongoing litigation.” The Justice Department declined to comment. The White House referred a request for comment to the State Department and the Trump Organization, which declined to comment before publication. Following publication of this article, Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten sent an email to Reuters describing the story as “inaccurate” and “misleading”. He said Trump World Tower is owned by its third-party condominium owners and therefore Trump would not receive proceeds from the lease of such units. Six legal experts said that regardless of who owns those units, the fact that Trump was collecting fees for managing the building while foreign governments were paying to live there represents a potential breach of the emoluments clause. Certain constitutional scholars counter that the definition of “emolument” should be more narrow, a view that Trump’s attorneys share. The 1982 Foreign Missions Act requires foreign governments to get State Department clearance for any purchase, lease, sale, or other use of a property in the United States. Through the Freedom of Information Act, Reuters obtained diplomatic notes sent to the agency under this requirement from early 2015 until late 2017. The records show that in the eight months following Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration, foreign governments sent 13 notes to the State Department seeking permission to rent or renew leases in Trump World Tower. That is more solicitations from foreign governments for new or renewed leases in that building than in the previous two years combined. The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases, according to other documents viewed by Reuters and people familiar with the leases. Five of those governments - Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the European Union - had also sought to rent units there in 2015 and 2016, State Department records showed.   Reuters could not confirm whether the State Department signed off on two other lease requests from Algeria and South Korea and three additional requests from Kuwait. “Letting this go without Congress knowing about it condones the creation of a second, opaque track of foreign policy,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor at Yale Law School and former legal adviser at the State Department. “What it might lead to is a group of countries enriching the people in power on the mistaken belief that it’s going to improve their access.” (For a graphic on foreign government leases at Trump World Tower, see: tmsnrt.rs/2DHJKOS) The 18-year-old luxury skyscraper is located next to the United Nations headquarters near the East River, and is not to be confused with Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue landmark where Trump maintains a residence.  Although Garten, the attorney, contended the emoluments question is moot because Trump World Tower units are owned by third parties, Trump does earn income through the Trump Corporation, a Trump-owned company that manages Trump World Tower and draws its income from fees paid by unit owners, according to the building’s financial records. In 2017, the president earned more than $15 million in management and related fees through the properties managed by the Trump Corporation, according to the president’s financial disclosure. The document did not reveal how much of that sum came from Trump World Tower. In at least eight instances in 2017, third-party owners in Trump World Tower leased their units to foreign governments. When privately-owned units are leased, their owners typically use that rental income to cover management fees and other common charges, according to two unit owners in Trump World Tower and four real estate experts interviewed by Reuters. Reuters was unable to determine exactly how the owners who leased the units to the foreign governments paid their fees. But even if the condominium owners did not use their rental income to pay their common charges, it still could be considered an emolument because the foreign governments helped those owners defray their costs, with the benefit flowing to Trump, according to Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University School of Law who has studied the history of Justice Department interpretations on the subject. In other words, Clark said, payments passing through a chain of intermediaries to a U.S. official could still constitute emoluments because they could ultimately enrich and influence the behavior of the official. In legal opinions issued under previous administrations, Clark said, “the Justice Department has expressed concern that foreign governments would use companies as conduits for foreign emoluments.” However, South Texas College of Law professor Josh Blackman said that foreign government payments that enrich a U.S. official should only constitute emoluments if they are “tied to the discharge of official duties.” He has filed briefs in each emoluments lawsuit against Trump endorsing this view. While U.S. presidents have rarely needed to seek approval of payments from foreign governments in the past, Trump’s continued ownership of his vast network of businesses has left him exposed to more potential emoluments issues than any previous U.S. president, according to legal and ethics experts. The revenue Trump draws from foreign government business at his properties, such as the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has sparked lawsuits by U.S. lawmakers and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, alleging this income violates the emoluments clause. Defining exactly what constitutes an emolument is at the heart of those cases. Trump’s attorneys have argued in court that the Constitution only requires him to seek congressional approval for foreign emoluments offered in connection with his role as president. Trump has retained ownership of his global business interests while president, but handed off day-to-day control to his oldest sons and a longtime company executive. On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss one of the emoluments lawsuits against him, saying Trump’s narrow definition of emoluments was “unpersuasive and inconsistent”. Courts may ultimately decide whether some of Trump’s business dealings violate the Constitution. Issuing such judgments is not the job of the State Department office in charge of reviewing foreign government property requests, according to Patrick Kennedy, who from 2007 to 2017 was the top State Department official in charge of the internal administration of the agency. He said that office’s mandate is to screen for national security and diplomatic concerns, not for potential emolument violations. If the State Department began obstructing requests from foreign governments to lease units in Trump-affiliated properties, he said, it could prompt them to retaliate against U.S. diplomats seeking housing in their territories. “The State Department’s interest in saying ‘no’ is probably zero if there’s no security threat and we have good reciprocal relations with the countries,” Kennedy told Reuters. According to the State Department records obtained by Reuters, which covered the period from January 2015 through September 2017, Trump World Tower was the only Trump-affiliated building in the United States where foreign governments sought to lease or buy units.  In 2017, the median monthly asking rent for units in Trump World Tower was $8,500, according to real estate website StreetEasy. That was more than 2.5 times the median in the surrounding neighborhood, known as Turtle Bay. Some of the foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, had previously purchased property in the building, where the average unit currently sells for nearly $7 million, according to StreetEasy. Mohammad Alkadi, a spokesman for the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, said Trump World Tower’s prime location near U.N. headquarters was the kingdom’s motivation to lease there. “The governments pay for these units in the building not to get favors from Trump or anything, but just because it’s very convenient and comfortable for us,” Alkadi said. He said he moved into his own unit in Trump World Tower at the end of 2017. Slovakia, another Trump World Tower renter, said in a statement that its lease was “fully in line with U.S. legislation and our internal guidelines.” Slovakia’s prime minister is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House today to discuss security cooperation and other issues. The Malaysian mission to the United Nations said it was not currently renting a unit in Trump World Tower when reached by phone in April. It declined to comment on the unit it rented in 2017. That lease was confirmed to Reuters by a person familiar with the transaction. All the other governments that sought to rent units after Trump’s inauguration declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

28,Puerto Rico announces deal to restructure power authority debt - Reuters,"May 4, 2019 /  1:44 AM / a day ago","4 Min ReadSAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s power utility struck a deal with a group of creditors that seeks to allow the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth to restructure more than $8 billion of bonds, according to an announcement by government authorities on Friday. A group of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) bondholders, bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp, along with the island’s government and federally created financial oversight board, reached a restructuring support agreement that would reduce the utility’s debt by up to 32.5 percent. The move paves the way for a plan of adjustment for PREPA, which filed for a form of bankruptcy in July 2017 after a previous restructuring deal fell apart. The latest agreement, which requires support from at least 67 percent of voting bondholders to materialize, would shed about $3 billion in debt service payments over the next decade.  The deal also requires the approval of a U.S. judge hearing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy cases, as well as legislative action. Under the agreement, investors will exchange their PREPA bonds at 67.5 cents on the dollar for new Tranche A bonds and 10 cents on the dollar for new Tranche B bonds. The latter would be contingent on full payment of Tranche A bonds and future electricity demand on the island. PREPA will pay off the new bonds through a special charge levied on its customers. The new charge starts at approximately 1 cent per kilowatt hour prior to the deal’s closing, increasing to some 2.768 cents per kilowatt hour upon closing and gradually increasing to approximately 4.552 cents per kilowatt hour during the expected 40-year lifespan of the bonds. The deal still lacks the support of other PREPA creditors, most notably bond insurer National Public Finance Guarantee Corp. A spokesman for National declined to comment. National Public Finance filed an objection last month when a deal in principle was announced, saying that “until very recently” it was excluded from negotiations even though it is PREPA’s largest creditor. National has also asked the court to appoint a receiver for PREPA, support among other creditor remains unclear following Friday’s announcement. According to government and board officials, the privatization of PREPA is under way, with transmission and distribution contracts with private companies expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2020. “Now with this agreement we take a monumental step to provide for the restructuring of the debts and obligations of PREPA and finally conclude the bankruptcy process,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a statement. If approved in federal court, PREPA’s restructuring would mark the third major deal in Puerto Rico’s efforts to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. Deals involving the island’s sales tax-backed bonds and Government Development Bank have been approved by U.S. Judge Laura Taylor Swain. PREPA’s financial and operational problems were compounded by Hurricane Maria, which slammed into the island in September 2017, decimating an electric grid already struggling due to poor rate collection, heavy management turnover and lack of maintenance.

29,Ride-hailing drivers in New York to strike ahead of Uber IPO - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:02 PM / Updated 15 hours ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc’s drivers in New York will go on strike next week shortly before the ride-hailing company goes public to protest what they view as unfair employment conditions, a taxi union said on Friday. The protests underscore the challenge for Uber of finding a way to lower driver costs in order to become profitable and paying drivers enough to retain their services.  Drivers for Uber, as well Lyft Inc and other ride-hailing apps, will strike on Wednesday for two hours, beginning at 7 a.m. ET (1100 GMT). Uber currently expects to price its IPO on Thursday and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange the following day.  The drivers join peers in San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., who are also planning to strike. The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) said the drivers are demanding job security, livable incomes and a cap on the amount ride-hailing companies can collect from fares.  “Uber claims that we are independent contractors even though they set our rates and control our work day,” Sonam Lama, a NYTWA member and Uber driver since 2015, said in a statement.  “Uber executives are getting rich off of our work. They should treat us with respect. We are striking to send a message that drivers will keep rising up,” Lama said. Uber cautioned in its IPO filing that its business would be “adversely affected” if drivers were classified as employees instead of independent contractors. The company hopes to be valued at between $80.5 billion and $91.5 billion. Uber has yet to turn a profit. It reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2019.  “I voted to go on strike because drivers need job security,” said Henry Rolands, an NYTWA member and Lyft driver.  Uber did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lyft said in an emailed statement that its drivers’ hourly earnings have increased over the last two year. “Over 75 percent drive less than 10 hours a week to supplement their existing jobs. On average, drivers nationwide earn over $20 per hour,” Lyft said. Reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie AdlerAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

34,U.S. job growth surges; unemployment rate drops to 3.6 % - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:10 AM / in a day","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in nearly half a century, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive stimulus from Republican tax cuts and spending increases fades. The Labor Department’s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the greater-than-expected 263,000 new jobs created last month were spread across most industry sectors, and the unemployment rate was just 3.6%, the lowest since December 1969.  Still, wage gains did not accelerate as expected, holding at  a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. Moreover, the decline in the unemployment rate was driven largely by the   most people leaving the labor force in a year and a half.  The report was supportive of the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to keep interest rates unchanged and signal little desire to adjust monetary policy anytime soon. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the economy and job growth as “a bit stronger than we anticipated” and inflation “somewhat weaker.” “Employment gains are strong enough to dispel any immediate concerns over the health of the economy, while wage gains are not strong enough to force the Federal Reserve’s hand to tighten the policy stance,” said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. Aside from April’s surge in nonfarm payrolls, the economy created 16,000 more jobs in February and March than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185,000 jobs last month. The strong economy, especially the labor market, could boost President Donald Trump’s re-election hopes next year. Trump, who  has boasted about the economy being one of the major wins of his first term in office, cheered April’s robust employment gains. “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,” Trump tweeted. The economy will mark 10 years of expansion in July, the longest on record. Job gains are well above the roughly 100,000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The second month of strong employment growth put to rest concerns about a recession and ironically undercut Trump’s call for the Fed to cut interest rates. A brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve in March had fanned fears of an economic downturn, leading markets to price in a rate cut this year. “It would be awfully hard for the Fed to explain a rate cut given the strong job market, so forget that,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  Hiring remains strong, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages in the transportation, manufacturing and construction industries, suggesting there is still some spare capacity in the labor market.  Steadily rising wages had until recently been keeping workers in the labor force and drawing back some who had dropped out. Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents, or 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March. That kept the annual increase in wages at 3.2% for a second straight month. Though wage growth is not strong enough to drive up inflation, it is seen sufficient to underpin economic growth as the stimulus from last year’s $1.5 trillion tax cut wanes. The economy grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first quarter, driven by a surge in exports and inventories, quickening from the October-December period’s 2.2% pace. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while  U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Despite April’s robust job gains, there are signs the economy slowed early in the second quarter.  A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showed a measure of services industry activity dropped to a 20-month low in April. It followed on the heels of another ISM survey this week showing factory activity hitting a 2-1/2-year low last month.          Last month’s two-tenths of a percentage point drop in the  unemployment rate from 3.8 % in March was because 490,000 people left the labor force in April, the most in 18 months. It was the fourth straight month of workers dropping out of the labor force and could shrink the pool of available workers. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.8% in April from 63.0% in March.  This suggested more slack in the labor market than indicated by the unemployment rate. The drop in participation was almost across the board, with significant declines among prime-age and younger workers. “The supply side of the economy looks a little less shiny in light of the decline in the participation rate,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 7.3% in April. Economists expect job growth will slow this year as fewer workers become available, which will push up wages and lift inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target. An inflation measure tracked by the U.S. central bank increased 1.6% in the year to March, the smallest gain in 14 months. Employment at construction sites increased by 33,000 jobs in April, rising for a second straight month. Manufacturing sector payrolls rebounded by 4,000 jobs after being unchanged in March. The industry is being pressured by layoffs in the automobile sector as assembly plants try to cope with declining sales and an inventory overhang. The auto sector shed jobs for a fourth straight month. Employment increased in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, transportation and warehousing, and financial activities industries. But retail payrolls declined for a third straight month.  Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, rebounded last month after dropping in March. Government payrolls increased by 27,000 in April.  Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Dan BurnsAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

37,"Baltimore mayor quits amid questions over $500,000 book deal - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  7:51 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, whose home and offices were raided by federal agents last week as part of an investigation into her financial dealings, abruptly resigned on Thursday.  Pugh, a Democrat and former state lawmaker, apologized for harming the city’s image in a statement read by her lawyer.  “I am confident that I have left the city in capable hands for the duration of the term to which I was elected,” Pugh, 69, said in her resignation letter. City Council President Bernard “Jack” Young becomes acting mayor. Pugh’s statement and formal resignation letter were read by attorney Steve Silverman at a news conference outside his Baltimore office. Pugh, who has rarely been seen in public since taking medical leave on April 1, did not attend.  Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service searched Pugh’s home and offices on April 25 following a string of investigative stories in the Baltimore Sun newspaper beginning in mid-March about her financial dealings.  The newspaper reported that Pugh had been paid at least $500,000 by the University of Maryland Medical System, where she sat on the board, for her self-published children’s books about a character named “Healthy Holly.” Pugh, who initially defended the book deal, called the arrangement a “regrettable mistake” at a March 28 press conference. She announced her leave two days later, saying she was suffering from pneumonia. “This was the right decision, as it was clear the mayor could no longer lead effectively. The federal and state investigations must and will continue to uncover the facts,” Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said on Twitter. Young, who has served as acting mayor during Pugh’s month-long absence, said in a separate statement that he learned only on Thursday afternoon that she was stepping down. “I believe this action is in the best interest of Baltimore,” Young said. Although I understand that this ordeal has caused real pain for many Baltimoreans, I promise that we will emerge from it more committed than ever to building a stronger Baltimore.” Pugh was elected to a four-year term as mayor in 2016 after gaining prominence as a state lawmaker during protests over the 2015 death in police custody of a 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray. Following the law enforcement raids, 14 of the 15 Baltimore City Council members urged Pugh to resign. Young did not sign the letter. Hogan, a Republican, also called for her to quit.

38,"Explainer: How powerful are Congress subpoenas, contempt citations? - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  2:47 PM / 2 days ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. House Democrats threatened on Thursday to hold Attorney General William Barr in “contempt of Congress” for not complying with a subpoena to hand over an unredacted version of the Mueller report. What does that mean? Congress does not arrest and detain people for ignoring its subpoenas anymore, but it still has significant power to demand witnesses and documents, though it could take time. The contempt citation is a key part of that congressional clout. President Donald Trump, with Barr’s assistance, is stonewalling several inquiries being led by Democrats in the House of Representatives into his administration, his family and his personal business interests. The confrontation between the White House and Congress escalated on Thursday when Barr refused to appear for a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The report focused on Russian interference in favor of Trump in the 2016 U.S. election and subsequent attempts by Trump to impede Mueller’s investigation. Here is how the congressional subpoena, contempt and enforcement process works. What is a subpoena? A subpoena is a legally enforceable demand for documents, data, or witness testimony. Subpoenas are typically used by litigants in court cases. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress’s power to issue subpoenas, saying in order to write laws it also needs to be able to investigate. Congress’ power to issue subpoenas, while broad, is not unlimited. The high court has said Congress is not a law enforcement agency, and cannot investigate someone purely to expose wrongdoing or damaging information about them for political gain. A subpoena must potentially further some “legitimate legislative purpose,” the court has said. What can Congress do to a government official who ignores one?  If lawmakers want to punish someone who ignores a congressional subpoena they typically first hold the offender “in contempt of Congress,” legal experts said. The contempt process can start in either the House or the Senate. Unlike with legislation, it only takes one of the chambers to make and enforce a contempt citation.   Typically, the members of the congressional committee that issued the subpoena will vote on whether to move forward with a contempt finding. If a majority supports the resolution, then another vote will be held by the entire chamber. The Democrats have majority control of the House; Trump’s Republican Party holds the Senate. Only a majority of the 435-member House needs to support a contempt finding for one to be reached. After a contempt vote, Congress has powers to enforce a subpoena. How is a contempt finding enforced? The Supreme Court said in 1821 that Congress has “inherent authority” to arrest and detain recalcitrant witnesses.  In 1927, the high court said the Senate acted lawfully in sending its deputy sergeant-at-arms to Ohio to arrest and detain the brother of the then-attorney general, who had refused to testify about a bribery scheme known as the Teapot Dome scandal.   It has been almost a century since Congress exercised this arrest-and-detain authority, and the practice is unlikely to make a comeback, legal experts said. Alternatively, Congress can ask the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a federal prosecutor, to bring criminal charges against a witness who refuses to appear. There is a criminal law that specifically prohibits flouting a congressional subpoena. But this option is also unlikely to be pursued, at least when it comes to subpoenas against executive branch officials, given that federal prosecutors are part of the branch’s Justice Department.  “It would be odd, structurally, because it would mean the Trump administration would be acting to enforce subpoenas against the Trump administration,” said Lisa Kern Griffin, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Duke University.  For this reason, in modern times Congress has opted for a third and final approach to enforcing a contempt finding: getting its lawyers to bring a civil lawsuit asking a judge to rule that compliance is required.  Failure to comply with such an order can trigger a “contempt of court” finding, enforced through daily fines and even imprisonment, Griffin said.

39,Rights groups sue over U.S. decision to hold asylum seekers without bond - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:39 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Immigrant rights groups asked a U.S. court on Thursday to reverse a Trump administration decision that allows asylum seekers who cross the border illegally to be held without bond. The groups, which include the American Civil Liberties Union, say an April 16 decision by U.S. Attorney General William Barr violates the asylum seekers’ rights under U.S. law and puts thousands of people at risk of being detained for months or years while they wait for their cases to work their way through a backlogged immigration court system.   “This is about the Trump administration’s agenda of locking up any asylum seeker they can to deter people from seeking protection under our laws,” said Michael Tan, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU filed the challenge with the American Immigration Council and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “The administration cannot bypass the Constitution by arbitrarily locking people up.” The Department of Justice declined to comment. The court challenge came in the form of an amended complaint to an existing lawsuit. Earlier in April, U.S. federal judge Marsha Pechman had ordered the U.S. government to provide faster bond hearings to asylum seekers who pass their initial screenings. Before that ruling could go into effect, the Attorney General reversed an immigration court precedent that had allowed asylum seekers who entered the country illegally to ask an immigration judge to release them on bond. Barr delayed the implementation of his decision by 90 days, and the rights groups are suing to stop it from going into effect. Without the possibility of a bond hearing before an immigration judge, asylum seekers would be reliant on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) granting them parole. An average of 46,756 immigrants have been held in ICE detention each day of fiscal year 2019, an ICE representative said on Thursday. Barr’s ruling applies only to adult asylum seekers without children, as families cannot be detained for longer than 20 days.

40,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo expects to refund monthly service fees to some customers - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:43 PM / a day ago","2 Min Read(Adds company comment, paragraphs 3-6) By Imani Moise May 3 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Friday it expects to refund some servicing fees to customers who may have been confused about how to avoid monthly charges. The San Francisco-based bank said in a securities filing it was reviewing past disclosures to consumers about mininum debit card activity requirements to waive certain monthly fees. Roughly 90 percent of customers successfully avoid paying servicing fees on checking accounts by meeting certain requirements, said Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Seitz. Consumers can get waivers for the monthly fee by connecting a qualifying direct deposit or keeping the a minimum daily balance among other things. The bank has made changes to address guidelines for how to get a waiver through debit card use that had the potential to be confusing. “We have made improvements in how we communicate all of the ways customers qualify for a monthly service fee waiver, and how they can track their progress,” Seitz said. “It’s the right thing to do for our customers.” The disclosure adds to the long list of remediation efforts going on at the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets after a string of admissions that it may have improperly charged customers for various financial products. The bank became mired in scandal in 2016 when it revealed it had opened potentially millions of unauthorized accounts. Since then, issues have cropped up in each of Wells Fargo’s primary business segments. Wells Fargo has said it is committed to compensating all customers affected by its actions and has already paid out tens of millions of dollars to make consumers whole. In the same filing the company also raised the high end of potential losses in excess of the company’s accrual to $3.1 billion, up from $2.7 billion at the end of last year.

41,Puerto Rico oversight board sues over bond payment pledge - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:38 PM / a day ago","4 Min ReadMay 3 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s longstanding pledge to pay off about $13 billion of outstanding general obligation (GO) bonds is just an unsecured promise, according to the latest lawsuits brought by the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s federally created financial oversight board. Its action capped off a barrage of litigation this week that unsettled the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market, where states, cities, schools and other issuers sell debt. Complaints were filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico late on Thursday against GO bondholders, including mutual funds and other institutional and individual investors who contend they have a lien on the island government’s revenue. The board countered that Puerto Rico’s pledge of its “good faith, credit and taxing power” is “nothing more than a promise to pay” and that promise is not secured by any of the government’s property. Even if a lien existed under local law, it would be avoidable under bankruptcy law, according to the lawsuits. Defendants included BlackRock Financial Management, whose representative declined to comment. The lawsuits were filed ahead of the second anniversary of Puerto Rico’s May 3, 2017, bankruptcy, which seeks to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. They followed other litigation this week against hundreds of government vendors, as well as Wall street banks and firms that participated in the island’s bond sales. The board also went after certain GO bondholders in an attempt to recoup past debt service payments. James Spiotto, managing director of Chapman Strategic Advisors and a municipal bankruptcy expert, called the board’s attack against liens a probable negotiating ploy. “Clearly, there’s not a lot alleged as far as facts in there,” he said on Friday. While detailing “significant risks” for investors, the prospectus for $3.5 billion of GO bonds Puerto Rico sold in 2014 pointed to the commonwealth’s “irrevocable pledge” of its credit and taxing power to pay off the debt. It also stated that the bonds have a “first claim on available commonwealth resources” under Puerto Rico’s constitution. In January, the oversight board filed a motion seeking to invalidate more than $6 billion of GO bonds - the 2014 issue and bonds sold in 2012 - on the basis they were issued in violation of constitutional debt limits. Analysts said the litigation involving GO bonds could harm the municipal market and make it harder for the board to meet its mandate under the 2016 federal PROMESA Act to restore Puerto Rico’s capital markets access. “It will cast a dark cloud over any other full-faith general obligation credit in the future if they get away with it,” said Richard Ciccarone, the head of Merritt Research Services. Axios Advisors told clients: “Even if the board is successful in these efforts, which we seriously doubt, the commonwealth will be paying the price later on when it tries to access the capital markets again.” (Reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago, additional reporting by Luis Valentin Ortiz in San Juan Editing by Matthew Lewis)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

43,Wall St. climbs as jobs data supports upbeat economic outlook - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:35 AM / a day ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in a broad-based rally on Friday as stronger-than-expected job growth in April coupled with muted wage gains left investors upbeat about the outlook for the economy and interest rates. The Nasdaq registered a record high close, while the S&P 500 ended just shy of a record high finish.     The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to 3.6 percent, the lowest level since December 1969. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. The data supports the Federal Reserve’s patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “That could portend for better earnings in the future for companies.” Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 197.16 points, or 0.75%, to 26,504.95, the S&P 500 gained 28.12 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.64, and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.22 points, or 1.58%, to 8,164.00. For the week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.2% while the Dow slipped 0.2%. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around the S&P 500 earnings estimate for the first quarter to a rise of almost 1% compared with the 2% decline projected at the start of April.     Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 13.5% after the maker of Rubbermaid and other consumer goods exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled 10.4% after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.8% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.77-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.85-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 30 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.47 billion shares, compared to the 6.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

45,World stocks rally after U.S. payrolls data tops views; inflation comments dent dollar - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:11 AM / a day ago","4 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that shot past expectations, while the dollar weakened after several Federal Reserve officials voiced concerns about low inflation.  U.S. job growth surged in April, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus recedes. Wall Street stocks rallied, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, giving both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq weekly gains.  The strong jobs report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, when the Fed reiterated that it would remain patient on any changes in interest rates and indicated that no rate cuts were on tap for later this year, disappointing the expectations of some investors. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “The Fed is going to pay attention more to inflation more than anything else. As long as inflation is below trend, that’s good.”  U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 196.55 points, or 0.75%, to 26,504.34, the S&P 500 gained 28.06 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 127.22 points, or 1.58%, to 8,164.00. For the week, the S&P gained 0.19%, the Dow slipped 0.15% and the Nasdaq gained 0.22%. European shares closed higher, helped by gains in Adidas and HSBC after strong quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.78%. MSCI’s index scored its sixth straight week of gains.  The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects of the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, and following softer-than-expected data from an industry group on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low.  New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that “raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates ‘lower for longer’ after periods of low inflation” can keep people’s expectations for prices at the right levels.

48,Brazil's Natura to invest $5 million in new brands through venture capital funds - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:21 PM / in a day","2 Min ReadSAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil cosmetics company Natura intends to invest up to $5 million in new brands in beauty and wellness segments in Europe and the United States through venture capital funds, executives said on Friday. “Dynamo Beauty Ventures is the first vehicle that matches our criteria and focus moving forward and we anticipate there will be more of these initiatives in the future,” Roberto Marques, chairman of Natura’s board, told analysts in a call to discuss quarterly results.  Natura shares were down 0.4 percent in late afternoon trading, at 50.29 reais, after the company posted weaker than expected results amid a sluggish economic recovery in Brazil. First-quarter net income grew by 72.8 percent year-on-year to 41.9 million reais ($10.63 million), below a consensus estimate of 59.1 million reais compiled by Refinitiv, as higher expenses overshadowed revenue gains.     “Natura’s first-quarter results showed a reversal of the robust growth trend for the brand in Brazil, implying potential downside to our estimates,” analysts at Itaú BBA wrote in a report. Despite challenging conditions in key markets, notably Brazil, the company is still on track to deliver targets previously established and continue to deleverage, Natura’s chairman said. He emphasized the firm expects to reduce its net debt/EBITDA ratio to 1.4 by 2021 compared to 2.95 at the end of March this year.                                          Market participants have been closely following Natura’s leverage, as the company negotiates a deal with cosmetics maker Avon Products two years after acquiring The Body Shop brand from L’Oreal in a 1 billion-euro transaction. “At this point we have no further developments to report on our deal talks with Avon,” the chairman said.

49,PG&E unable to strike deal over renewable power contracts: court documents - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:13 PM / in a day","3 Min Read(Reuters) - PG&E Corp was unable to reach a deal with NextEra Energy Inc and other companies with which it has billions of dollars in power contracts in a jurisdictional dispute over the bankrupt utility’s ability to walk away from or amend those agreements, according to court documents.     The matter will now be decided by the judge overseeing PG&E’s bankruptcy “in the coming weeks,” according to the documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday.     At issue is whether the bankruptcy court or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has jurisdiction over the power purchase contracts, which are worth up to $42 billion.     San Francisco-based PG&E wants the matter resolved in bankruptcy court, while NextEra and others want FERC involved. FERC has said it has “concurrent jurisdiction” with the bankruptcy court in such matters.     The contracts have emerged as one of the most contentious issues in PG&E’s bankruptcy, which the company launched in January in the face of tens of billions of dollars in potential liability stemming from wildfires in California in recent years that may be traced to its equipment.     The question of what will happen to the power contracts is critical for California’s goal to source 60% of its power from sources of renewable energy by 2030. Most of the power contracts in question are for solar or wind resources to fulfill the state mandate. “PG&E recognizes its important role in supporting the state’s commitment to clean energy initiatives and remains committed to continuing to help California achieve its bold clean energy goals,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We appreciate the concerns from stakeholders across the state concerning the impact that Chapter 11 filing could have on the state’s clean energy progress. PG&E has made no decisions as to whether to assume or reject contracts as part of filing for Chapter 11.” Officials from NextEra were not immediately available for comment.Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali urged the companies and PG&E to try to reach an agreement by a May 3 deadline. In the court papers made public on Friday, they said they were unable to reach an agreement.

50,Senate upholds veto of Yemen resolution in victory for Trump Saudi policy - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  6:11 PM / in 2 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday sustained President Donald Trump’s veto of a resolution demanding an end to military support for the Saudi-led coalition waging war in Yemen, in a victory for the White House’s policy of continued backing for the kingdom. The vote was 53 to 45, falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto, despite a handful of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats in backing the war powers resolution. It was only the second veto of Trump’s presidency, both this year. Neither has garnered the two-thirds support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives needed to override. The resolution’s passage earlier this year marked the first time both the Senate and House supported the provision of the War Powers Act limiting the president’s ability to send troops into action without congressional authorization. Backers of the resolution said they wanted to reassert Congress’ constitutional power to declare war, and send a strong message to Saudi Arabia about the devastating civilian toll of the four-year-long civil war in Yemen. “We’ve been materially assisting a foreign power in its efforts to bomb its adversaries. And sometimes helping that foreign power to bomb innocent civilians on the ground in the process,” Republican Senator Mike Lee, a co-sponsor of the resolution, said before the vote. The war in Yemen, which pits Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Houthi rebels backed by Iran, has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world’s most dire humanitarian crisis, with the country on the brink of famine. Many members of Congress have also become increasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia over its human rights record, anger fueled by the murder at a Saudi consulate in Turkey last year of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and columnist for the Washington Post. Saudi officials have rejected accusations that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing. Resolution opponents argued that support for the Saudi-led coalition was not an appropriate use of the War Powers Act, because the military provides supports such as targeting assistance, not troops. “The premise of this resolution is fundamentally flawed and I believe a misrepresentation of what is happening on the ground in Yemen,” Republican Senator Jim Risch said before the vote. Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is writing legislation to address the situation with Saudi Arabia. He declined to discuss possible specific provisions of the measure, but said he hoped to introduce it in May with the goal of finding something that could pass both the Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-controlled House and be signed, not vetoed, by Trump. Amid U.S. and international anger over the civilian toll of the Yemen conflict, the Trump administration last year stopped providing refueling support for Saudi aircraft in Yemen.

51,"White House letter blasts Mueller report, says Trump has right to instruct advisers not to testify - Reuters","May 2, 2019 /  5:03 PM / 2 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has the right to instruct advisers not to testify before congressional oversight probes related to the Russia investigation, the White House said in a letter that blasts Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report as deeply flawed. The April 19 letter from White House legal counsel Emmet Flood to Attorney General William Barr, obtained by Reuters on Thursday, was in line with Trump’s confrontational approach to dealing with a Democratic effort to use the Mueller report as a springboard into more investigations. Flood said Trump’s decision to let advisers cooperate with the Mueller probe does not extend to congressional oversight investigations. Democrats have argued Trump waived the right to assert executive privilege by allowing advisers to cooperate extensively with Mueller.  The White House conclusion was an indication that Trump would, if necessary, declare executive privilege to prevent former lawyer Don McGahn and other advisers from testifying to Congress, which would likely trigger a court battle. “It is one thing for a president to encourage complete cooperation and transparency in a criminal investigation conducted largely within the Executive Branch. It is something else entirely to allow his advisers to appear before Congress...” the letter said. Tensions have flared between the White House and congressional Democrats since the Mueller report was released. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, threatened to hold Barr in contempt for resisting demands for Mueller’s full, unredacted report, and accused Trump of “a growing attack” on democracy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, accused Barr of committing a crime, saying he lied to lawmakers about his interactions with Mueller. The White House letter was transmitted to Barr a day after the release of the Mueller report, in which the special counsel determined that Trump did not collude with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign but pointedly did not say whether the president committed obstruction of justice. Flood’s letter said the Mueller report itself suffers from “an extraordinary legal defect.” According to relevant law, the letter said, Mueller should have rendered a judgment on whether to prosecute or not to prosecute. Instead, Mueller produced “a prosecutorial curiosity - part ‘truth commission’ report and part law school exam paper,” the letter said. “What prosecutors are supposed to do is complete an investigation and then either ask the grand jury to return an indictment or decline to charge the case,” Flood wrote in his the five-page letter to Barr. “The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” he said.  Flood’s letter addressed whether Mueller had given Congress a “roadmap” for its own inquiry with his report. If that is the case, the letter said, “it too serves as additional evidence of the SCO’s (Special Counsel’s Office) refusal to follow applicable law.” The letter also provided a potential justification for a probe that Trump wants into those who began investigating his possible ties to Russia in 2016, when he was still a candidate. Of concern in particular were leaks about conversations that former Trump foreign policy adviser Michael Flynn had with Sergey Kislyak, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, in 2016. “Government officials, with access to classified information derived from a counterintelligence investigation and from classified intelligence intercepts, engaged in a campaign of illegal leaks against the president,” the letter said.

52,House backs Paris agreement in first climate bill in a decade - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  4:48 PM / 3 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed its first climate-change bill in a decade, voting 231-190 to require that Trump administration keep the United States as a party to the Paris Climate Agreement. The Climate Action Now Act would require President Donald Trump to develop a plan for the United States to meet the goals it committed to in the Paris agreement to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and block federal funds from being used to advance the formal U.S. withdrawal from the pact.  Trump has stood by his 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the 2015 climate accord and has been dismissive of regulations aimed at slashing greenhouse gas emissions. The bill, which passed along party lines, as expected, with three Republicans backing the measure, was meant to signal to the international community that many Americans support the Paris agreement regardless of Trump’s decision to abandon it. “Today we sent a message to the president, to the American people and to the world that we recognize the seriousness of the climate crisis, and that we intend to do our part to address it. Today we sent the message: We are still in,” said Representative Frank Pallone, chairman of the House energy committee. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would not take up the legislation, dismissing the bill as “political theater” by Democrats. Democrats have put climate change back on the agenda in Congress after re-gaining the majority in the House earlier this year, holding dozens of hearings on the issue. Many of the Democratic candidates hoping to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election have made climate change a top-tier issue of their campaigns. All have backed re-entering the United States into the Paris Climate Agreement. A few candidates, including most recently former Texas Representative Beto O’Rourke, have also supported setting a goal for the United States to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 - one of the goals of the Paris agreement.

53,Fed 'insurance' rate cut not likely soon as economy hums along - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:29 PM / a day ago","6 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was criticized by analysts and investors this week when he seemed to set aside concerns about weak U.S. inflation, repeatedly describing its recent decline as temporary and dimming market expectations of an interest rate cut. But in a series of statements and speeches since last fall, Powell, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida and others have been consistent: The idea of preemptive “insurance” rate moves in either direction appear off the table for now, absent some unexpected event that raises new risks or shocks the economy into a higher or lower gear. Just as they no longer feel the need to get “ahead of the curve,” and raise rates in plenty of time to prevent inflation from rising too fast in the future, neither do they feel the current U.S. economy, with a 3.6 percent unemployment rate and growth above its long-term trend, needs an extra push and lower borrowing costs from the U.S. central bank.   Even after recent data showed core inflation, which excludes the impact of food and energy, at just 1.6 percent, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target, Clarida said on Friday the central bank remains “at or close to” its mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. More important, he regarded expectations about future inflation as “stable,” a sign he thinks inflation is less likely to slip further. “With the economy operating at or close to the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives ... we can, I believe, afford to be data-dependent” and watch the flow of information for signs of change or developing risks, Clarida said in a speech at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Clarida’s remarks are one side of a sharp debate within the Fed about how to respond to an economy that is, on many levels, doing well, but also not behaving as expected. In particular, the current rate of unemployment, at a 50-year low, would be expected to lead to higher inflation as businesses bid up the price of labor, and workers bid up the price of goods.  It is an issue deeper than can be settled with a single rate cut. Indeed, the Fed’s view is that inflation is shaped largely by public and market psychology - with tight labor markets and resource constraints, and an array of those “transitory” factors cited by Powell pushing it narrowly around that underlying level. Rising productivity and other forces may be holding inflation back in a systematic way, allowing for even more growth without price pressures. That’s the argument White House officials have used to justify their demand for Fed rate cuts, and the idea has some traction at the central bank as well. But with the economy on an even keel and rates still relatively low, top officials like Clarida and Powell feel it better to wait for more compelling evidence - if only as a way to manage the risks of getting it wrong. Inflation is difficult to measure, with changes in statistical methods or one-off price swings in certain goods sometimes distorting the headline number in ways the Fed tries to look through. In similar language to Powell, former Fed chief Janet Yellen and her colleagues delayed expected rate increases for a year in 2016 as wobbling oil prices and other issues created their own set of “transitory” concerns.    In his press conference after the end of a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, Powell referred to the weak inflation as transitory no fewer than nine times. That led some in the market to question the Fed chief’s assessment. Primed for a signal about rate cuts last week, stock and bond investors jumped in the opposite direction as Powell, in effect, restated that not much had changed since his last press conference in March. On Friday, Clarida cautioned against relying too heavily on the actions of “noisy” financial markets. He has previously warned about the risks of using economic models to try to look too far into the future, particularly at times like this when the Fed is near its targets, the economy is growing, and the costs of a mistake in either direction are higher.  There are arguments in the other direction. Echoing comments he has previously made, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Friday the central bank’s credibility and commitment to its inflation target may be at risk if it doesn’t respond at some point. Lost credibility may make monetary policy harder to conduct as time passes, he said. But even officials worried about low inflation, as well as the direction of bond and other financial markets, seem ready to wait for now. With nothing bad in the offing, there’s no need yet to buy “insurance,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday in an interview with Reuters. He added that the Fed’s decision in January to halt further rate increases was a “huge” change that might still lead to higher inflation as the economy adjusts to it. The Fed hiked rates four times in 2018 and had, as late as December, anticipated more rises in borrowing costs this year.  Bullard said he would be ready to wait through the summer before considering a rate cut.   “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up, then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard said.

The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. Average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. The data supports the Federal Reserve’s patient stance toward raising interest rates, which is a positive for stocks. “We continue to have stronger and stronger job growth, and it seems like there’s less and less inflation, which is really odd. You typically don’t see that, and basically what that signals to the market is that the Fed is on hold,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. “As long as inflation is below trend, that’s good. So if you have the Fed in a box, you have strong labor force gains, that could portend for better earnings in the future for companies,” he said. Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of the internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.5%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 202.6 points, or 0.77%, to 26,510.39, the S&P 500 gained 26.62 points, or 0.91%, to 2,944.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 112.10 points, or 1.39%, to 8,148.87. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies reporting so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around the earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise compared with a 2% decline projected at the start of April. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue, while Activision Blizzard Inc fell after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.73-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 28 new lows.

55,"Oil edges up after strong economic data, but ends week lower - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  1:46 AM / in a day","3 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Friday as strong U.S. economic data boosted demand sentiment and as production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela tightened the market. Still, oil futures recorded weekly declines after a jump in U.S. crude inventories reported this week. Brent crude oil futures settled at $70.85 a barrel, rising 10 cents. The global benchmark shed 2.6% for the week, breaking a five-week winning streak.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures closed at $61.94 a barrel, up 13 cents, while losing about 3% percent during the week, its second straight weekly decline. A U.S. jobs report that showed growth surging in April and the unemployment rate dropping to a more than 49-year low of 3.6% increased expectations that crude demand would stay strong. “If more people are going to work, they’re going to have to drive or take transportation to get there,” Phil Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “It’s a good indication we could expect to see gasoline demand, oil demand picking up into the summer.” Equities rallied and the U.S. dollar weakened following the report, which also supported oil futures, Streible said. Oil prices tend to follow moves in equities, and demand for the U.S. dollar-linked commodity often increases when the greenback slips.  Gains in the oil market, however, were capped by Wednesday’s report that showed U.S. crude inventories jumping to their highest since September 2017 and production hitting a record 12.3 million barrels per day last week.. Exports of U.S. crude broke through 3 million bpd in November for the first time and peaked at 3.6 million bpd earlier this year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.     This week’s U.S. rig count, an indicator of future output, showed energy firms adding crude drilling rigs for the first time in three weeks, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production link: tmsnrt.rs/2VFPX81). U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, helped to tighten the market and support prices. Russia, part of OPEC+, is cutting oil output by as much as 10 percent for several days as its exports suffered from disruptions due to contamination of crude in a major pipeline to Europe and at a key port for shipments, industry sources said. Production from Saudi Arabia could edge higher in June to meet domestic demand for power generation, though output will remain within its quota in the supply pact, sources familiar with the kingdom’s policy said. The world’s top crude exporter is expected to produce about 10 million bpd in May, slightly higher than in April but still below its 10.3 million bpd quota under the OPEC-led deal, industry sources said.

57,RPT-Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  7:03 PM / a day ago","2 Min Read(Repeats to attach to corrected alert, no change to content of story) By Ann Saphir SAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview. “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the US economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said, adding that he would not view such a rate cut as taking out insurance against a possible bad outcome, as some analysts have suggested the Fed might do. Instead, he said, it would be a move that would build credibility and help the Fed fight future downturns. “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, despite an unemployment rate that has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent.

58,PRECIOUS-Gold eyes biggest daily gain in two months as dollar retreats - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:12 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read* Gold down 0.5 pct so far this week * Platinum set for worst week in eight * SPDR gold holdings fall to lowest in nearly 7 months (Updates prices, adds fresh comments) By Brijesh Patel May 3 (Reuters) - Gold was headed for its biggest daily rise in two months on Friday, clawing away from a four-month low hit in the previous session, helped by a pullback in the dollar and as some investors covered their short positions. Spot gold rose 0.7% to $1,279.47 per ounce as of 2:22 p.m. EDT (1822 GMT), and was set for its biggest percentage gain since March 8. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% higher at $1,281.30 an ounce. The metal on Thursday dipped to $1,265.85, its lowest since the end of December. “We are seeing a short-covering rally after a sell-off during the week. We also saw some good physical demand at price levels below $1,270,” said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. “The dollar is weak, which is also helping gold,” he added. Despite a strong U.S. jobs report, the dollar was down 0.3%, as traders focused on the weaker aspects in the report. The U.S. wage gains did not accelerate as expected last month, holding at a reading that is consistent with moderate inflation. A moderate pace of wage growth indicated that there would not be a rate hike anytime soon, in turn boosting appeal for the non-interest bearing metal, said an analyst based in New York. Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the bullion. Despite the gains, gold is still on track to post a weekly decline of about 0.5% after U.S. Federal Reserve signaled little appetite to adjust interest rates in the near term. However, two Fed officials said on Friday they were increasingly worried about weak inflation, an indication that some U.S. central bankers see a growing case for a future interest rate cut even as others push for continued patience. Market participants were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a resolution to the year long tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the U.S.-China trade negotiations are going pretty well. Reflecting investor sentiment toward bullion, holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust, fell about 0.2% to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. Among other metals, silver rose 2.2% to $14.94 per ounce, after falling to a more than four-month low of $14.52 in the previous session. Platinum gained 2.6% to $869.75 per ounce, but has lost 3.3% for the week so far, its biggest weekly decline in eight. Palladium climbed 0.8% to $1,365.01 an ounce. (Reporting by Brijesh Patel and K.

59,MONEY MARKETS-U.S. fed funds rate slips after Fed's tweak on reserves - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:43 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read* Fed funds rate falls to lowest since mid-April * Fed funds/IOER, however, hit a record 6 bps on Thursday * Repo facility seen best to control fed funds rate - BAML (Adds background, quotes, graphic) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - The rate U.S. banks charge each other to borrow reserves overnight fell on Thursday a day after the Federal Reserve adjusted what it pays banks on reserves they leave with the U.S. central bank, New York Federal Reserve data released on Friday showed. The average or effective federal funds rate fell to 2.41%, the lowest since April 16, from 2.45% on Wednesday. The fed funds rate’s premium above the Fed’s interest on excess reserves (IOER), however, grew to a record-high 6 basis points from 5 basis points the day before. A number of factors have led to the stubborn upward drift in the fed funds rate, including reduced bank reserves linked to the Fed’s balance sheet normalization, increased government borrowing, and less willingness by big banks to lend reserves due to tougher capital standards in response to the global credit crisis. On Wednesday, the Fed shrank the gap between the IOER and the bottom end of its target rate on interest rates for a third time since last June in a bid to prevent the fed funds rate reaching the top of the range. It trimmed IOER by 5 basis points to 2.35%, while holding its target range at 2.25-2.50%. “The Fed got its intended results,” said John Bellows, portfolio manager at Western Asset Management Co. in Pasadena, California. “The IOER cuts are technical in nature.” Still the Fed’s control of the fed funds rate is critical to bolster investors’ confidence in its effectiveness to conduct monetary policy. Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists Mark Cabana and Olivia Lima said on Friday the latest IOER move “is only a Band-Aid” to keep a lid on upward pressure on the fed funds rate. They suggested the central bank should introduce a standing repo program that would allow banks to exchange their Treasury holdings for short-term cash as the best means to control the fed funds rate.

60,GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb after U.S. payrolls data tops views; dollar falls with inflation comments - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  6:28 PM / in 2 days","4 Min Read* U.S. jobless rate falls to 49-year low * Global shares on track for sixth straight weekly gain * Dollar weakens after comments from Fed officials (Updates with close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rallied on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that blew past expectations, while the dollar weakened after several Federal Reserve officials voiced concerns about low inflation. U.S. job growth surged in April, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus recedes. Wall Street stocks rallied, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, putting both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq on track for weekly gains. The strong jobs report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday, when the Fed reiterated that it would remain patient on any changes in interest rates and indicated that no rate cuts were on tap for later this year, disappointing the expectations of some investors. “There was probably something in the report for everybody but to the extent the Fed wants to stay patient, they will focus most on that wage number,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “There is just not a lot of inflationary pressures that are out there.” U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 209.15 points, or 0.8%, to 26,516.94, the S&P 500 gained 27.94 points, or 0.96%, to 2,945.46, and the Nasdaq Composite added 117.69 points, or 1.46%, to 8,154.46. European shares closed higher, helped by gains in Adidas and HSBC after strong quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.39% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.75%. The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects of the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, and following softer-than-expected data from an industry group on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, the president of the Chicago Fed, Charles Evans, said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low. New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that “raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates ‘lower for longer’ after periods of low inflation” can keep people’s expectations for prices at the right levels. The dollar index fell 0.31%, with the euro up 0.13% to $1.1191. Oil prices advanced but were still on pace for a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude rose 0.31% to $62.00 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.02, up 0.38% on the day. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.5305%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2-week high. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Dan Grebler and

63,Florida teachers can arm themselves under new gun bill - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  5:57 PM / in 3 days","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Florida’s legislature on Wednesday passed a bill allowing teachers to carry guns in the classroom, expanding a program launched after the deadly high school shooting in Parkland with the aim of preventing another such massacre. Florida’s House of Representatives voted 65 to 47 to pass the bill after hours of debate over two days in which the Republican majority thwarted Democratic efforts to amend, stall or kill the measure. Florida’s Senate approved it 22 to 17 last week. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to sign the bill into law, enabling school districts wishing to take part in the voluntary Guardian program to arm those teachers who pass a 144-hour training course. On Feb. 14, 2018, a former student armed with a semiautomatic rifle opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and wounding 17 others. President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association have argued an armed teacher could provide the best defense against a shooter bent on mass murder. Opponents questioned whether the solution to gun violence should be the presence of even more guns and warned of the danger of a teacher misfiring during a crisis or police mistaking an armed teacher for the assailant. Passage marks a victory for gun-rights advocates, who were on the defensive a year ago when Parkland students inspired nationwide protests in favor of gun control. After the Parkland shooting, Florida lawmakers rushed through legislation that required schools to place at least one armed staff member or law-enforcement officer at each campus. The law also imposed a three-day waiting period for gun purchases and raised the age limit for buying rifles from 18 to 21 - remarkable measures in a gun-friendly state. Although last year’s law allowed some school personnel to carry weapons, guns were still banned from the classroom.  Backers of arming classroom teachers revived the issue this year, arguing that school shootings often erupt too quickly for law enforcement to respond. In anticipation of passage, school employees in 40 of Florida’s 67 counties already enrolled in or planned to take the 144-hour course, a spokesman for the Speaker of the House said. Some counties have resolved not to participate in the Guardian program. Florida’s gun-control advocates had made stopping the proposal a top priority, among them Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense, which is funded by billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

64,Democratic Senator Bennet of Colorado joins crowded 2020 field - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  12:28 PM / in 3 days","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, whose political career has centered on improving the American education system, on Thursday became the latest Democrat to join the sprawling field of candidates seeking the party’s 2020 presidential nomination. Bennet, 54, is serving his second full six-year term in the Senate. He previously ran Denver’s public schools.  “If we continue to go down the path we’re going - and this isn’t just about President Trump, it’s about the politics that existed before he got there ... we’re going to be the first generation of Americans to leave less opportunity, not more, to the next generation, and I just need to do everything I can do to make sure that we don’t do that,” Bennet said in an interview with “CBS This Morning.” He joins a field of more than a dozen candidates, with others such as former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Montana Governor Steve Bullock still deciding whether to run.  Bennet is the second Coloradan to enter the 2020 race after John Hickenlooper, a former governor, announced his candidacy on March 4. Hickenlooper’s presence complicates Bennet’s bid. Both are white male moderates running in a party where much of the energy lies with the diverse, activist left.  Bennet is not well known nationally. However, his stint in 2014 as chairman of the Democratic Party’s Senate campaign arm linked him with a network of political operatives and donors across the country.  The normally congenial Bennet also drew notice during the partial U.S. government shutdown in January, when he blasted Republican Ted Cruz on the Senate floor for leading a similar shutdown in 2013 that stopped the flow of emergency funds to Colorado. Democratic nominating contests begin in February 2020 in the traditional starting point of Iowa. The candidate who amasses the majority of the delegates will be nominated at the party’s convention in the summer and will likely face President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. Since losing the White House in 2016, Democrats have grappled with how to best take on Trump in 2020. Some in the party believe an establishment figure who can appeal to centrist voters is the way to victory. Others argue a fresh face - and particularly a diverse one - is needed to energize the party’s increasingly left-leaning base.  As a presidential candidate, Bennet may have to fight the perception that he is a product of the party’s establishment at a time when progressives and political newcomers are favored by the base. He grew up in Washington the son of a former State Department official, and his grandfather advised President Franklin Roosevelt. A graduate of Wesleyan University and Yale Law School, he served in the Clinton Justice Department before moving West. When Hickenlooper served as mayor of Denver, Bennet worked as his chief of staff and then took over the city’s schools, gaining national recognition for his reform efforts.  In 2009, after Democratic then-President Barack Obama named U.S. Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado as his interior secretary, Hickenlooper and Bennet vied to be appointed to replace him. Bennet, surprisingly, got the nod. He narrowly won his first full term a year later.  Bennet’s popularity has grown in Colorado as the state has become more liberal. In 2016, he was re-elected to the Senate by more than 5 percentage points, polling particularly well with Hispanic voters.  Bennet told CBS he was focused on economic mobility and integrity in government. In a campaign video, Bennet also highlighted goals that included improving the healthcare system and investing in education and job training. “The Democratic party doesn’t stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the American people think,” Bennet said. “A process like this is long overdue in the Democratic party.”   He also acknowledged his bout of prostate cancer, saying it was very “clarifying” in solidifying his plans for the future and that he now had a clean bill of health. The diagnosis also made him more sensitive to the need for Americans to have health insurance, he said.

65,"Barr cancels second day of testimony, escalating battle with U.S. Congress - Reuters","May 1, 2019 /  10:04 AM / in 3 days","7 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday canceled plans to testify before the House of Representatives about his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, further inflaming tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress. Barr was due to face the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, but pulled out after the two sides were unable to agree on the format for the hearing. “It’s simply part of the administration’s complete stonewalling of Congress,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told reporters.  Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Nadler’s proposal to have committee lawyers question Barr was “unprecedented and unnecessary,” saying questions should come from lawmakers.     The Justice Department also said on Wednesday it would not comply with a Nadler-issued subpoena seeking an unredacted version of Mueller’s report and underlying investigative files from the probe. Earlier on Wednesday, Barr spent more than four hours before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee where he fended off Democratic criticism of his decision to clear Trump of criminal obstruction of justice and faulted Special Counsel Robert Mueller for not reaching a conclusion of his own on the issue. In his first congressional testimony since releasing a redacted version of Mueller’s report on April 18, Barr also dismissed Mueller’s complaints that he initially disclosed the special counsel’s conclusions on March 24 in an incomplete way that caused public confusion. Illustrating tensions between the two men, Barr described as “a bit snitty” a March 27 letter from Mueller in which the special counsel urged him to release broader summaries of his findings - a step Barr rejected. Trump seized on Barr’s March 24 letter to declare that he had been fully exonerated. Several Democrats on the Senate committee called for Barr’s resignation. Democrats have accused Barr of trying to protect the Republican president, who is seeking re-election next year. They pressed Barr on why he decided two days after receiving the 448-page document from Mueller in March to conclude that Trump had not unlawfully sought to obstruct the 22-month investigation. “I don’t think the government had a prosecutable case,” Barr said. The report detailed extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign’s expectation that it would benefit from Russia’s actions, which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The report also detailed a series of actions Trump took to try to impede the investigation. Mueller, a former FBI director, concluded there was insufficient evidence to show a criminal conspiracy and opted not to make a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice, but pointedly did not exonerate him. Barr has said he and Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department’s No. 2 official, then determined there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction.  Barr often appeared to excuse or rationalize Trump’s conduct, asserting that the president may not necessarily have been trying to derail Mueller’s investigation. Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono told Barr that he had sacrificed a “once-decent reputation for the grifter and liar that sits in the Oval Office.”  Senator Lindsey Graham, the committee’s Republican chairman, rushed to Barr’s defense, telling Hirono: “You’ve slandered this man.” Trump had been unfairly smeared, Barr said, by suspicions he had collaborated with Russia in the election. “Two years of his administration have been dominated by the allegations that have now been proven false. To listen to some of the rhetoric, you would think that the Mueller report had found the opposite,” Barr said. Barr was critical of Mueller for not reaching a conclusion himself on whether Trump obstructed the probe. “I think that if he felt that he shouldn’t go down the path of making a traditional prosecutorial decision, then he shouldn’t have investigated,” Barr said. Barr was asked about the report’s finding that Trump directed then-White House counsel Don McGahn in June 2017 to tell Rosenstein that Mueller had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the order. Rosenstein had appointed Mueller the prior month. Barr, appointed by Trump after the president fired his predecessor, Jeff Sessions, seemed to minimize the incident and said Trump believed “he never outright directed the firing of Mueller.” Trump could have presumably appointed someone else to do the job after Mueller was fired, he said. “We did not think in this case that the government could show corrupt intent,” Barr said.  Democrats on the panel were unconvinced. “I think the president’s intention was very clear. He wanted this to end,” Senator Dick Durbin said. Under questioning by Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, a 2020 presidential candidate, Barr acknowledged he did not review the investigation’s underlying evidence before deciding to clear Trump of obstruction. Barr disputed the view that Mueller was handing the baton to Congress for possible impeachment proceedings. “That would be very inappropriate,” Barr said. “That’s not what the Justice Department does.” The Democratic-controlled House would start any such impeachment effort, but Trump could not be removed from office without approval by a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled Senate.  Democrats also accused Barr of misleading Congress, by saying in April that he did not know whether Mueller agreed with his characterization of the report - failing to mention Mueller’s March 27 letter that Barr’s initial summary did not “fully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office’s work.”  Barr testified that Mueller was unhappy with the way the conclusions were being characterized in the media, not his account of the conclusions, although Mueller’s letter did not mention media coverage. “The letter is a bit snitty,” Barr said, using a word meaning disagreeably ill-tempered, “and I think it was probably written by a member of his staff.” Several Democrats demanded that Mueller testify before the committee, but Graham ruled that out.  Committee Republicans did not focus on Trump’s conduct but rather on what they saw as the FBI’s improper surveillance during the 2016 race of Trump aides they suspected of being Russian agents, as well as on the Kremlin’s election meddling. Barr indicated that to him, the matter was closed. “The report is now in the hands of the American people,” he said. “We’re out of it. We have to stop using the criminal justice system as a political weapon.” Reporting by Andy Sullivan, Sarah N.

The Labor Department said employers added 263,000 jobs in April, which blew past expectations, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, indicating muted inflationary pressure. “The labor market appears to be very strong and there is no inflation. It’s a great number for risk assets,” said John Brady, managing director at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “In terms of Fed policymakers, they don’t have to do much at all.” Falling unemployment is expected to put an upward pressure on inflation and supported the Federal Reserve’s decision to be patient with interest rate hikes. However, St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard, who voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, said the central bank may need to cut rates if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter. Boosting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, Amazon.com Inc rose 3.2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.43%, leading a rally among the 11 major S&P sectors. At 13:09 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 188.79 points, or 0.72%, at 26,496.58. The S&P 500 was up 25.68 points, or 0.88%, at 2,943.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 103.99 points, or 1.29%, at 8,140.76. With nearly 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise compared with a 2% decline at the start of April. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 11.4% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc tumbled 13.8%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.2% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.77-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.19-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 30 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 26 new lows.

67,Some U.S. Fed officials are more worried by weak inflation - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:28 PM / 2 days ago","4 Min ReadSTOCKHOLM/STANFORD, Calif. (Reuters) - Two Federal Reserve policymakers on Friday said they were increasingly worried about weak inflation, an indication that some U.S. central bankers see a growing case for a future interest rate cut even as others push for continued patience.  Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, speaking at a conference in Stockholm, said this year’s drop in inflation excluding the impact of food and energy was worrisome. He said he was also concerned the economy might underperform. “Then policy may have to be left on hold - or perhaps even loosened,” Evans said in his speech. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard was even more emphatic about his concern about the softness in so-called core inflation, which rose only 1.6 percent in the 12 months through March, well below the Fed’s 2 percent target. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview.  “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this, but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the U.S. economy. It would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2 percent target,” Bullard said. The remarks by Evans and Bullard, who both have a vote on Fed policy this year, contrasted with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments to reporters after the release of the central bank’s latest policy statement on Wednesday. Powell repeatedly answered questions about the prospect of a rate cut by saying there was no strong case for moving rates in either direction. That sentiment was echoed on Friday by another senior policymaker, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida. He said the U.S. economy was in a “very good place,” with inflation expectations seemingly “stable,” and that the central bank had time to look at incoming data before deciding on any further interest rate changes. Data pointing to economic strength, highlighted by a jobs report on Friday that showed the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in nearly 50 years in April, and inflation that may be signaling underlying weakness is a conundrum for the Fed.  “Underlying inflation trends may be mired below 2 percent,” said Evans in Stockholm, noting that the Fed could some of the credibility that would be needed to fight future recessions if it can’t hit its inflation target. But he added that it was also possible inflation could surge and require rate hikes “over time.”  Bullard, in an earlier interview with CNBC, said the current level of inflation was making him a little nervous and that the Fed’s gradual three-year tightening cycle, which ended in December, might be constraining the economy despite signs of robust growth. “We’re a little tight,” Bullard said, referring to the federal funds rate, which the central bank uses to control borrowing costs. It is currently set in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.  The Fed is increasingly under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to ease monetary policy, a situation that has raised concerns about the central bank’s ability to maintain its independence. Trump, who has said recent rate hikes have undercut his efforts to boost economic growth, called on Tuesday for rates to be cut by a full percentage point. The top White House economic adviser on Friday said the central bank would likely move in that direction. “With these low inflation numbers, I think the Fed is actually looking at rate cuts,” White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow told Fox Business Network. “Our views right now intellectually are not really far apart from the Federal Reserve.” Kudlow has said the Fed is free to set policy as it sees fit, while Powell and other U.S. central bankers have insisted they operate independently from political pressure.

68,US middle market loan yields fall amid low dealflow - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  5:12 PM / 2 days ago","6 Min ReadNEW YORK, May 3 (LPC) - Middle market institutional term loan yields fell in the second quarter of 2019, reversing six consecutive quarters of upward momentum, as investor demand continues to exceed a limited supply of deals. Average yields fell to 7.57% in the second quarter, from 8.06% in the first three months of the year, but are still higher than 6.66% in the second quarter of 2018, according to LPC data. The US middle market is seeing unprecedented demand as cash continues to flood into the sector from alternative lenders and private debt funds, who are competing with more established banks and institutional investors for limited dealflow, which is putting pressure on pricing. “Pricing is crunching down,” a middle market lender said. “There are deals, but not at the level we all want.” Excess demand is putting downward pressure on spreads and new issue prices, which together with Libor – the benchmark rate for floating-rate loans – make up the three components of leveraged loan yields. Falling Libor rates are also contributing to the drop in yields. Rising Libor rates previously helped to boost returns and offset the effect of tighter spreads, but the benchmark rate has been falling after peaking in December. Average middle market spreads have tightened to 463bp from 483bp in the first quarter, while the average issue price is now 99.03 versus 98.64 in the first quarter, LPC data show. “At the syndicated end of the middle market, where a lot of people are looking, the premium over large corporate deals has clearly diminished, which is one reason we don’t think investing in those deals makes sense,” said Tom Newberry, global head of direct lending at CVC Credit Partners. Investors expect a premium for middle market lending as the loans are less liquid and smaller companies are more vulnerable in an economic downturn due to higher customer concentration and less diversified revenue streams. Middle market loans offer a premium over broadly syndicated loans as a result, but this has shrunk to 70bp from 102bp a year ago, which is raising concern that investors are not being sufficiently rewarded for the additional risk. Rather investors can find additional yield in the smaller and more illiquid segments of the market. “Typically if you lend into illiquid situations you can still get 200-300bp of premium. That is a bit compressed relative to a year ago, but the spreads are still decent.” Newberry said. US institutional volume is picking up again after December’s volatility put a hole in the M&A machine and loan pipeline for early 2019. Dealflow is still limited, which is forcing investors to take what they can get and helping companies to achieve competitive pricing. In April, home maintenance and repair services provider Wrench Group raised a US$420m buyout loan, backing the company’s sale to Leonard Green & Partners. The funding included a US$45m revolving credit facility, a US$225m first-lien term loan, a US$75m first-lien delayed draw term loan and a US$75m eight-year second-lien facility. Jefferies was lead left on the first-lien portion of the transaction and was joined by Macquarie and Antares Capital, while Crescent Capital was lead arranger on the second-lien term loan. The first-lien term loan was well oversubscribed, according to a middle market investor. The spread cleared at 425bp, at the tight end of guidance of 425bp-450bp over Libor. Also in April, SERVPRO, a franchisor of property damage restoration services, was in market with a US$485m credit facility backing Blackstone’s acquisition of a majority stake in the business. The company raised a US$45m five-year revolver, a US$315m seven-year first-lien term loan and a US$125m eight-year privately placed second-lien term loan. During syndication, SERVPRO cut pricing on the first-lien tranche. The spread decreased to 350bp with a 0% floor, tight of guidance in the 375bp-400bp range. The discount also tightened to 99.75 from the 99.5 offered at launch. Pricing will step down by 25bp if the company issues an initial public offering. Jefferies, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank arranged the deal. Pricing pressure is to be expected in the current environment, where deals remain thin on the ground despite improving market technicals, market participants said. Although pricing is moving lower, loan spreads and all-in yields are still higher than a year ago, and look robust compared to red-hot conditions in 2017 and 2018, when repricing drove robust dealflow. Although cash continues to flow into the US middle market from direct lenders and private credit funds, 24 weeks of outflows from retail loan funds totaling US$26.2bn is tempering demand, as relative value investors see better opportunities elsewhere while further US interest rate rises remain on hold. If the situation reverses and US rates start to rise again, middle market pricing could come under renewed pressure as investors that buy loans for bigger companies chase yield in smaller middle market deals. This could be exacerbated by the return of opportunistic refinancing and repricing loans, after the recent reappearance of aggressive dividend recapitalisation loans, which allow private equity firms to extract money by releveraging portfolio companies with new debt.

69,Fed's Williams makes case for 'lower for longer' rates - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  5:03 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve policymaker is making the case for changing how the Fed responds to periods of tepid inflation by keeping interest rates “lower for longer.” New York Fed President John Williams said in a research paper here he co-authored and distributed on Friday that policies that ""raise inflation expectations by keeping interest rates 'lower for longer' after periods of low inflation"" can keep people's expectations for prices at the right levels and reduce the negative effects of near-zero interest rates on the economy.  The research, which Williams will present at a conference at Stanford University in California on Friday, is geared toward a broad Fed policy review of how to get inflation to rise to and remain at its 2% target. That review may take many more months to complete. At the same time, Fed officials are discussing the more immediate issue of whether a rate cut might eventually be needed to keep prices rising at levels policymakers support. The White House has publicly called for the Fed to cut rates to support growth, with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence renewing those calls on Friday. “There’s no inflation; the economy is roaring,” Pence said in an interview with CNBC. “This is exactly the time, not only to not raise interest rates, but we ought to consider cutting them.” The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the “core” personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components, slowed to an annual rate of 1.6% in March. Some policymakers and analysts think the Fed is better equipped to respond to upward spikes in prices than to persistently low readings. That is because rate cuts lose their potency as borrowing costs approach zero. Any alternatives to the Fed’s current approach could be controversial. Williams’ paper develops an argument he has made before that people can start to expect central banks to miss their inflation target in periods where rates near zero, potentially hurting economic growth over time. But by aiming for inflation above the target during good times, policymakers eliminate weak inflation expectations and reduce the harm to the economy. Williams is vice-chairman and a permanent voting member of the Fed’s policy-setting committee. The issue is not strictly academic. The Fed now targets short-term rates from 2.25-2.50% and they could easily cut to near-zero again in response to the next recession.

70,CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Oil prices headed for weekly decline as U.S. output grows - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:42 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Corrects U.S. crude export data in paragraph 6) * Saudi Arabia could increase oil output * Russia resumes supply through Druzhba pipeline * U.S. oil output surges: tmsnrt.rs/2VBjcZX By Ahmad Ghaddar LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices were on track Friday for weekly declines as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. Brent crude oil futures were at $70.71 a barrel at 1344 GMT, down 4 cents and set for their first weekly loss after five weeks of gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 2 cents at $61.83, poised for a second straight weekly decline. “Even with deep losses in supply from Iran and Venezuela, as well as a few other countries around the world, OPEC+ will still need to hold back production to balance the market,” SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said in a note. The supply reflected output growth in the United States, he said. U.S. crude oil production reached a record 12.3 million barrels per day last week C-OUT-T-EIA, rising by about 2 million bpd over the past year. Exports of U.S. crude broke through 3 million bpd in November for the first time and hit a record 3.6 million bpd earlier this year, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Rising U.S. oil production has helped to offset some of the disruption caused by U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+. Production from Saudi Arabia could edge higher in June to meet domestic demand for power generation, though output will remain within its quota in the supply pact, sources familiar with the kingdom’s policy said. The world’s top crude exporter is expected to produce about 10 million bpd in May, slightly higher than in April but still below its 10.3 million bpd quota under the OPEC-led deal, industry sources said. Traders said that prices were also put under pressure by Russia’s pumping clean oil through the Druzhba pipeline towards western Europe again, after several countries halted imports last week because of contamination. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are offering their domestic refiners about 8 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves after supplies from the Druzhba pipeline were halted, industry sources said on Friday. In the United States, analysts say supply will rise further as its export infrastructure is improved. “One of the things that we can see in the near future is the de-bottlenecking of the Permian basin in the U.S. through new pipelines and export capacity,” said Will Hobbs, chief investment officer for Barclays Investment Solutions. “This will connect the world’s largest shale basin to the global oil market.” Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore,

71,METALS-Copper jumps on weaker dollar but logs weekly loss - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  11:37 AM / in 2 days","3 Min Read* GRAPHIC-2019 asset returns: tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl * LME copper stocks have surged since Feb. (Updates with dollar decline, closing prices) By Zandi Shabalala LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Copper rose on Friday on a weaker dollar and expectations for progress in U.S.-China trade talks, but the move higher was not enough to rescue prices from their worst week since November. A slide in the dollar boosted the appeal of most base metals which are priced in the U.S. currency, making them cheaper for holders of other currencies. “The (softer) dollar definitely seems to have improved sentiment in the commodities market,” said Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain. Investors also remained upbeat before U.S.-China trade talks next week that are widely expected to progress well following meetings in Beijing this week, analysts said. “The market would be very surprised if something doesn’t come out of trade talks over the next 2-4 weeks,” Bain said, adding that “if something didn’t happen I think you could see quite a sharp fall.” The tit-for-tat tariff dispute between the world’s top economies has cost both sides billions of dollars in exports, disrupted supply chains and roiled financial markets. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange ended 1.1 percent higher at $6,236 per tonne, rebounding from a two-and-a-half-month low touched the previous session. The metal used in the power industry and construction was down over 2.5 percent on the week, its biggest weekly loss since early November after computer-driven funds sold following an options expiry. DOLLAR: Traders focused on weaker spots in the U.S. jobs report, ignoring a jump in jobs growth and a 49-year-low in unemployment. At the same time, comments from two regional Federal Reserve chiefs supported bets the U.S. central bank might lower key lending rates by the end of the year. INVENTORIES: Copper stocks available to the market in LME-approved warehouses — on warrant stocks — dropped 5,750 tonnes to 164,375 tonnes MCUSTX-TOTAL. This is up from 21,600 tonnes at the end of February. TRADE TALKS: U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday that President Donald Trump was optimistic the United States could reach a deal on trade with China. ALUMINIUM: On warrant stocks of LME aluminium have jumped 36 percent over the last week and inched up a further 1,050 tonnes to 874,050 tonnes, LME data showed on Friday. MALSTX-TOTAL PRICES: Aluminium dipped 1.1 percent to $1,795.50 per tonne, zinc rose 1.5 percent to $2,772 after falling to a seven-week low in the previous session, lead gained 1.3 percent to $1,900, tin gained 0.3 percent to $19,325 while nickel was bid up 1.2 percent at $12,190.

72,Icahn discloses U.S. probe into sale of Manitowoc shares: filing - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  4:38 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min ReadBOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s company for information about trades in crane maker Manitowoc, Icahn Enterprises disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, in its first acknowledgement of such a probe. Icahn Enterprises said it received a subpoena after critics questioned the timing of Manitowoc stock sales Icahn, who briefly served as an unpaid adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, made before his administration announced steep steel tariffs in March 2018. Questions had swirled about whether the sales were prompted by inside information about Trump’s plans. The stocks of many U.S. industrial companies, major consumers of steel, fell that day after the announcement, with Manitowoc losing more than 6%. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York contacted Icahn Enterprises in June 2018, the company said in the filing. “We cooperated with the request and provided documents in response to the subpoena.” The U.S. Attorney’s office and Icahn’s office had no immediate comment. Manitowoc did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prosecutors in Manhattan have a history of pursuing major cases over insider trading on Wall Street, famously securing the trial conviction of hedge manager Raj Rajaratnam and a guilty plea from the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Icahn sold roughly one-third of his stake in Manitowoc, which uses steel to make its equipment, between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, 2018. Trump said on March 1 that he would impose 15% tariffs on steel imports and 10% on imported aluminum to make domestic production more attractive. In response to news reports about his stock sales, Icahn said he cut his position in Manitowoc for “legitimate investment reasons” and dismissed any speculation that his sale of shares was prompted by knowledge about Trump’s plans. Icahn, who has been friendly with Trump for decades, has been a sounding board for Trump and was instrumental in vetting people for key positions before Trump was inaugurated in 2017. He stepped down as an unpaid special adviser to Trump in August 2017. Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Nate Raymond; Editing by Richard ChangAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

73,"European shares rise on strong results, upbeat U.S. jobs data - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  7:57 AM / 2 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, recovering from their worst day in six weeks with support from robust jobs data from the United States and strong results from Adidas and HSBC.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 0.4 percent, rising up to 0.6 percent after strong U.S. jobs data, before trading back at mid-day levels. On the week, the index fell 0.2 percent after two week of gains.   Data on Friday showed that U.S. job growth surged in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity.[MKTS/GLOB] “The April (jobs) report allows the U.S. Federal Reserve to remain comfortably on hold for the next few meetings as it awaits more data, particularly on global risks and the inflation outlook,” said analysts at TD Securities in a note. Investors tend to dump stocks in a rising interest rate environment due to higher cost of capital and better appeal for bonds.  Shares around the globe had fallen on Thursday after the Fed signaled little appetite to adjust interest rates anytime soon, dampening hopes of a rate cut among market participants.  Gains of nearly 2 percent by London-listed shares of HSBC Holdings after the lender beat quarterly profit estimates, was the biggest boost to the pan-region index. French lender Societe Generale also rose as its capital buffer was stronger than expected, helping investors shrug off a decline in quarterly net profit. The personal and household goods sector rose 1.2 percent. Adidas jumped almost 10 percent to hit a record high after the sportswear maker’s quarterly net profit rose. “Not many European stocks are racking up all-time highs, and that underlines the bullish sentiment,” said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets, London. Basic resources stocks gained 1.4 percent as copper prices rebounded.  Fiat Chrysler jumped 4.6 percent after the carmaker said new U.S. pickup truck models would help the automaker achieve its 2019 profit targets and offset a weak first quarter. Meanwhile, Air France-KLM tumbled 5.5 percent as the Franco-Dutch group blamed higher fuel costs and tough price competition for its first-quarter loss. Reinsurer Swiss Re AG slid 3 percent to be one of the biggest drags on STOXX 600 on an unexpected fall in quarterly net profit. A more than 7 percent fall by German telecoms group Freenet was the worst on the broader index after UBS downgraded the stock’s rating to ‘sell’.

74,Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:44 PM / in 2 days","3 Min ReadPALO ALTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday.  “I certainly would be open to a cut,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a monetary policy conference at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year.  “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview.  “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the U.S. economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said.  In his view, he said, such a rate cut would not be insurance against a possible bad outcome, but rather a bid to boost Fed credibility along with inflation, and position the Fed to better fight future downturns.  “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said.  Still, he said, though the Fed’s policy stance is currently a “little bit tight,” cutting rates now would risk overdoing it on policy easing. The Fed’s January shift has helped push down Treasury yields, he said. And though it has not yet had an obvious effect on inflation, which by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, it might.   “You won’t know that until the July, August timeframe,” he said. Meanwhile unemployment has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent, a strong showing for the labor market that economists would normally expect to put upward pressure on inflation.

The Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings came in just shy of expectations, pointing to muted inflationary pressure. “The economy is looking fairly strong and inflation pressures are subdued, which is bullish for the stock market,” said Rahul Shah, chief executive at Ideal Asset Management in New York. “Risk sentiment is likely to be on because the Fed is likely to remain on hold because you would need to see a string of higher job numbers at this level for the Fed to consider raising rates.” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on Wednesday that decline in inflation was likely due to transient factors dampened hopes of an interest rate cut this year, pushing the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq off their record highs. All three major indexes were set to end the week lower, with the Nasdaq on course for its first weekly decline in five. At 11:31 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 122.47 points, or 0.47%, at 26,430.26, the S&P 500 was up 19.93 points, or 0.68%, at 2,937.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 90.98 points, or 1.13%, at 8,127.75. Also helping gains was a largely positive earnings season. Of the nearly 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The upbeat reports have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise from a 2% decline at the start of April. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with a 1.23% rise in consumer discretionary stocks powering the gains. Amazon.com Inc rose 2.9%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 10.6% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc plunged 15%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after it forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 6.4% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.24-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 24 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 61 new highs and 23 new lows.

76,U.S. military not given orders to prepare for war in Venezuela - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  3:00 PM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Wednesday appeared to downplay any active preparations to directly intervene in Venezuela to topple President Nicolas Maduro, but acknowledged detailed contingency planning as political turmoil in the oil-rich nation deepens. Hours after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was prepared to take military action, if necessary, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said the United States had carried out “exhaustive planning” on Venezuela. But he and other officials continued to emphasize diplomatic and economic pressure as a way to help oust Maduro, as opposed to a U.S.-military led regime change. Asked at one point whether the U.S. military had been given instructions to prepare for a conflict in Venezuela, perhaps by prepositioning U.S. troops, Kathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, said: “We, of course, always review available options and plan for contingencies. “But in this case we have not been given (the) sort of orders that you’re discussing, no,” Wheelbarger told the House Armed Services Committee. So far, the U.S. military has been largely a spectator amid  the unfolding U.S. foreign policy decisions on Venezuela, although it offered small contributions, like helping shuttle humanitarian aid to Colombia for further transport to Venezuela. It has also ramped up its intelligence collection and intelligence sharing with allies, like Colombia, while planning for a possible non-combatant evacuation of Americans from Venezuela, should the need arise.  Such planning is standard in any crisis of Venezuela’s magnitude. The top uniformed U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, said he was focused on intelligence gathering and being prepared to respond, if Trump sought greater involvement by the Pentagon. But he stressed that the military should act in a way that deepens its partnerships in Latin America — where the prospect of U.S. military intervention is deeply unpopular. “I think it really is very, very important that we work with others in the region to solve this problem,” Dunford said. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela’s president by some 50 countries including the United States, has so far failed to enlist Venezuela’s military leaders in his bid to remove Maduro from power. He faced a high-profile test of support on Wednesday after calling for the “largest march” in Venezuela’s history. U.S. Navy Admiral Craig Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Latin America, said a big focus for the United States and its partners in the region would be helping to restore vital Venezuelan economic infrastructure after Maduro’s exit — something he called “Day Now” planning. “We call it ‘Day Now’ because there is going to be a day when the legitimate government takes over, and it’s going to come when we least expect it — and it could be right now,” Faller said. When asked if he saw a role for the U.S. military in actually overthrowing Maduro’s government, Faller said: “Our leadership’s been clear: It has to be, should be, primarily a democratic transition.” Still, he said Southern Command was ready to act if called upon for any scenario. “We’re on the balls of our feet,” he said. In a sign the crisis was grabbing the full attention of Trump’s national security leaders, Shanahan canceled a planned trip to Europe on Wednesday, in part to help coordinate with the White House National Security Council and State Department on Venezuela. The National Security Council scheduled a meeting for Wednesday afternoon to discuss next steps.

79,"UPDATE 1-Revamped Euribor, Eonia set to win regulatory approval by year-end - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  3:59 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(Adds detail, background) By Marc Jones and Huw Jones LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Revamped versions of the Euribor and Eonia interest rate benchmarks are set to get the regulatory green light by the end of the year, helping the euro zone catch up with reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the global rate-rigging scandals. Jean-Louis Schirmann, the Secretary General of the Brussels-based administrator of Euribor and Eonia, told Reuters it had applied for approval with the Belgian financial markets regulator FSMA and hoped for clearance in the coming months. “We can confirm that this is EMMI’s (European Money Markets Institute) intention,” Schirmann said on Friday. FSMA confirmed the application, telling Reuters it expects to be able to grant EMMI approval for Euribor this summer, with both “compliant” with new EU benchmark rules by the end of the year. Eonia and Euribor are two of the main euro-denominated measures of money market lending rates and are widely used as a reference for pricing home loans, credit cards and other products. Banks in Europe and the United States were fined billions of dollars over the last decade for trying to rig Euribor and its larger cousin, the London Interbank Overnight Rate or Libor. EMMI’s application comes despite a recent decision by the European Commission to give ‘critical’ benchmarks like Euribor and Eonia an two extra years to end of 2021 to comply with new rules. Central banks are publishing their own “risk-free” rates as an alternative to Libor and its variants. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are already publishing their rates, but the European Central Bank is not due to start publishing its “Ester” rate until later this year. “The euro area is lagging, with the ECB launch of risk-free benchmark rate Ester slated for October 2019, while Euribor will likely be alive longer than other Libor rates,” JPMorgan said. This means the euro area will likely have a “hybrid” system for a while, meaning reformed rates and the new “risk-free” rate will sit side-by-side. This contrasts with Britain, where regulators want the BoE’s rate to replace Libor by the end of 2021. Formal approval for a revamped Euribor would also take pressure off industry to come up with a “fallback” for use if it was being discontinued.

80,UPDATE 2-Spain/German yield gap at tightest in nine months as periphery shines - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:37 AM / in 2 days","3 Min Read* Italy set for biggest weekly fall in yields in 6 wks * Spain 10-year bond yield close to lowest since 2016 * EZ flash CPI, US NFP due out * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Spain’s 10-year bond yield gap over safer Germany was at its tightest in almost nine months on Friday, while Italian borrowing costs were set for their biggest weekly fall in six weeks in a sign of improved sentiment towards the periphery. Bond yields in the likes of Germany, France and the Netherlands edged higher as data showed a rise in euro area inflation and Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann expressed scepticism about a proposal to grant banks some relief from negative central bank interest rates. But as the week draws to a close, it was the move in southern European bonds that stood out. Relief that S&P Global kept Italy’s ratings unchanged last Friday and Sunday’s election in Spain passed without any major upsets, sparked a fall in bonds yields and rise in prices at the start of the week. That move gathered pace as data lifted hopes of a recovery for regional economies: the Spanish manufacturing sector for instance expanded in April at its fastest rate since January, data showed on Thursday. “Near-term, this dynamic (in the periphery) looks set to extend,” said Christoph Rieger, head of rates at Commerzbank. “This week’s GDP data was better than expected and PMIs show improvements in the periphery while Germany has faltered.” Spain’s 10-year bond yield hovered near its lowest since late 2016, a level hit on Thursday at around 0.97 percent . As benchmark German bond yields inched up to 0.04 percent , the Spanish/German 10-year bond yield narrowed to around 94 bps - its tightest in almost nine months , before closing the day at around 99 bps. Italy’s 10-year bond yield was marginally higher at 2.56 percent, near over two-week lows hit the previous day. James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, said he was bullish on Spain long-term and started selling German Bunds last week. “In Europe, we’re long Spain versus Germany and France,” he said. “With that you get the best-performing economy of the majors in the euro zone and we’re past the event risk of the election.” Other analysts noted big flows into peripheral bonds this week, which they suspected was cross-asset investors shifting funds from equity to fixed income markets. Data showed euro zone inflation accelerated to 1.7 percent in April from 1.4 percent a month ago, beating expectations. German bond yields rose ahead of the data, with an inflation rise anticipated after strong German numbers earlier this week, before easing back slightly. “I wouldn’t get too excited about the inflation numbers as they reflect the timing of Easter and they should slip back,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.

81,Sterling surges to a 1-month high on Brexit deal hopes - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  8:13 AM / in 2 days","3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Sterling surged past $1.3150 on Friday after the leader of Britain’s opposition party said parliament must break the deadlock over Brexit and “get a deal done” to exit the European Union. It also rallied to a one-month high against the euro as broad dollar weakness prompted investors to cut short positions heading into a long weekend with Britain shut for a local holiday on Monday. Lee Hardman, MUFG’s currency analyst based in London said “optimism” over a “cross-party deal to break the impasse” had extended the move higher in sterling.  Traders heading into a three-day weekend in London may also be trimming any short positions in the pound in case they are caught out by positive news in the Brexit talks when markets are closed. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, said on Friday that the results of local elections held around the country the previous day should spur lawmakers to find a way to “get a deal done” to leave the EU. He was quoted by ITV as saying there was now a “huge impetus” on every lawmaker to deliver a deal. Against the dollar, the pound surged more than a percent to $1.3175, a one-month high.  Against the euro, the pound surged 0.9 percent to 84.98 pence, a new one-month high. Investors have been broadly impervious to tepid economic data this week and relatively hawkish comments from the Bank of England at a policy meeting on Thursday. The BoE said on Thursday that markets should expect interest rates to rise more in the next few years than they currently assume, if the economy grows as policymakers expect and inflation is brought back to target. Trading in the pound has become far less volatile as investors sit on the sidelines while British politicians try to find a way out of a deadlock over Brexit. Britain will not leave the EU until possibly the end of October after London and Brussels agreed a delay. But Friday’s moves underscored how sensitive markets remain to the prospect of any deal.  “Hopefully, both the political parties draw their conclusions after yesterday,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale in London, referring to the local elections. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives and the Labour Party were both punished by voters, who blame them for the deadlock over Brexit, partial results showed.

82,Fed's Bullard says he is open to rate cut if inflation stays low - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:42 PM / 2 days ago","2 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO, May 3 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates to boost inflation and regain credibility if inflation remains sluggish beyond the second quarter, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Friday. Bullard voted with the rest of the Fed’s policymakers on Wednesday to keep rates on hold, a move he said was justified because the Fed already made a “huge” policy shift in January by taking off the table the expectation it would raise interest rates this year. “If we go through the summer here and inflation expectations are still too low and actual inflation doesn’t seem to be picking up then I think the level of my concern would get more intense,” Bullard told Reuters in an interview. “I am open to a rate cut to try to combat this – but it would be a rate cut not because of bad data on the US economy – it would be a rate cut because we want to make sure that inflation expectations and eventually actual inflation is more consistent with our 2-percent target,” Bullard said, adding that he would not view such a rate cut as taking out insurance against a possible bad outcome, as some analysts have suggested the Fed might do. Instead, he said, it would be a move that would build credibility and help the Fed fight future downturns. “If you cut rates during boom times that would send a signal you are serious that you are trying to get inflation at 2 (percent) or above our target” of 2 percent. Cutting rates at a time that job growth is weak would be “less successful” at building such credibility, he said. Inflation by the Fed’s preferred gauge recently came in at 1.6 percent, despite an unemployment rate that has sunk to a 50-year-low of 3.6 percent.

84,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks climb, dollar dips in wake of U.S. payrolls report - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  3:27 PM / 2 days ago","4 Min Read* U.S. payrolls surge past expectations * Global shares on track for first weekly fall in six * Dollar weakens after comments from Fed officials (Updates with open of U.S. markets, changes byline, dateline; previous LONDON) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Global equity markets climbed on Friday, buoyed by a U.S. payrolls report that blew past expectations, while the dollar weakened after comments on inflation from some Federal Reserve officials. U.S. job growth surged in April, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 263,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6 percent, pointing to sustained strength in economic activity even as last year’s massive fiscal stimulus fades. The payrolls report lifted stocks on Wall Street, with each of the major indexes firmly in positive territory, although each was still poised to post a weekly decline. The strong report came in the wake of a Fed policy announcement on Wednesday in which some investors were anticipating the central bank to ease interest rates and recent calls from the Trump administration for a rate cut. “Hard to find fault. From the economy point of view, this is very, very solid,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “It supports a little bit of what Powell said that those who were hoping for him to talk about a rate cut, employment is certainly continuing at an amazing pace.” U.S. interest rate futures briefly added to losses on Friday after the jobs report as traders trimmed their bets the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 117.34 points, or 0.45%, to 26,425.13, the S&P 500 gained 20.42 points, or 0.70%, to 2,937.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 95.61 points, or 1.19%, to 8,132.39. European shares advanced, lifted in part by gains in Adidas after its quarterly results. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.44% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.60%. Despite the strong jobs data, the dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies as traders focused on the weaker aspects in the April U.S. payrolls report such as wage growth, following a softer-than-expected report on the services sector and comments from two Fed officials on inflation. The Federal Reserve may need to cut interest rates if the U.S. economy softens, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in remarks that focused on his concern over persistently weak inflation, while St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the Fed’s policy rate is “a little tight” and that current readings of inflation are uncomfortably low. The dollar index fell 0.33%, with the euro up 0.18% to $1.1196. Oil prices advanced but were still on pace for a weekly drop as surging U.S. output countered production losses in sanctions-hit Iran and Venezuela. U.S. crude rose 0.97% to $62.41 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.35, up 0.85% on the day. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.5214%, from 2.552% late on Thursday, falling from a 1-1/2 week high.

85,Indonesian 'Belt and Road' high-speed rail link expects $18 billion from satellite towns - Reuters,"May 2, 2019 /  5:02 AM / in 2 days","3 Min Read (The April 30 story corrects Economic to Economist in paragraph 8 and Yusuf to Jusuf in paragraph 12) By Cindy Silviana and Fanny Potkin JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Indonesian-Chinese consortium building a high-speed rail link between the capital Jakarta and the textiles hub of Bandung expects to earn $18 billion developing satellite towns and industrial centers along the line, a company official said. The rail project, part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond was described last month by China’s ambassador to Indonesia, Xiao Qian, as “the first high-speed rail of Southeast Asia”.  After nearly three years of delays over land ownership disputes, construction on the rail line, which is financed principally by a $4.5 billion loan from China’s Development Bank, finally kicked into gear in 2018..  The chief executive of Wijaya Karya (WIKA), which heads the Indonesian side of what is the most high-profile of several Belt and Road projects in Indonesia, said that the state-owned construction firm expects to book 266 trillion rupiah ($18.7 billion) from four transit-related developments by 2070. The Indonesian side, which also includes state rail company KAI, owns 60 percent while the Chinese, led by the China Railway Engineering Corporation, holds the rest.  WIKA CEO Tumiyana - who uses only one name -  said that 15 percent of the line has been completed, with 60 percent to be finished by the end of 2019.  Analysts say the plan to develop four new towns and industrial centers mimics China’s own approach to high-speed rail development. “This seems like it’s copying the general model of China’s urban development - if you build it, they will come,” said Nick Marro, a China analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. One of the sites previously visited by Reuters on an old tea plantation is due to be transformed into a sleek 5,000 hectare city with high-rise blocks and the campus of a new university. Indonesian and Chinese officials say the project’s success will be a gauge for future infrastructure cooperation. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously told Reuters “it’s a major project for the mutual benefit and cooperation between China and Indonesia and helps promote local economic and social development”. Indonesian vice-president Jusuf Kalla recently headed a delegation to China’s BRI forum, where it pitched to Chinese companies for up to $91 billion of infrastructure projects. Jakarta insists on a business-to-business structure for all potential BRI deals instead of China’s traditional government-to-government loan format, which has limited the amount of overall projects.

87,MOVES-Regions beefs up loan platform with focus on broadly syndicated debt - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  3:07 PM / 2 days ago","3 Min ReadNEW YORK, May 3 (LPC) - Regions is expanding its loan sales and trading platform to the broadly syndicated market, hiring Kevin Dooley as head of loan trading as trade volume in the asset class reached a near-record high in the first quarter. It is looking to add two to three salespeople in the next 12 to 18 months that have client relationships with both middle market and broadly syndicated institutional loan accounts, according to Rob Heffes, head of trading and credit distribution at Regions, who joined the bank in 2016. Dooley joined Regions from Natixis. He previously worked at BNP Paribas, RBS and UBS, according to FINRA BrokerCheck. The move expands Regions’ footprint in the institutional market, where some of the largest companies including American Airlines and Hilton Worldwide turn for financing. The bank had historically focused on so-called pro-rata loans, which include a revolving line of credit and a term loan A, which is typically sold to banks, rather than the broadly syndicated term loan B market, which is typically sold to mutual funds and Collateralized Loan Obligations. Regions had previously focused on pro-rata distribution based on the clients it lent to, but is expanding that focus, Heffes, who previously served as head of credit product sales and trading for CRT Capital and global head of high-yield trading for UBS, said in a telephone interview. “The business model is to support our corporate clients who need broader access to the capital markets, and having tools to allow them to do so,” he said. “We felt we didn’t have the depth to get into the larger rated markets in a material way and that is why we are growing the business.” There was near-record loan trade activity in the first quarter with US$224.2bn of volume, just missing the record of US$224.3bn set in the last three months of 2018 amid increased volatility, according to IHS Markit data. US leveraged loan prices dropped more than 4 percent in the fourth quarter, but have since rebounded, improving 4.1 percent this year through May 2, according to the LPC 100, a cohort of the 100 most widely held loans tracked by LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. “The message is, we have a strategic rationale for being in this business,” Heffes said. “We are going out of our way to find the right talent to bring in so that we can build something that fits Regions’ culture for both issuers and investors, and we will be patient in how we build out the business. We will build it the right way that stays true to the Regions’ mission.” (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing By Michelle Sierra and Jon Methven.)All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

88,SoftBank mulls IPO of $100 billion Vision Fund: source - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  12:01 PM / a day ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp is considering an initial public offering of its $100 billion Vision Fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The fund was set up in 2017 and has become the world’s largest technology investment fund. Its investments include ride-hailing pioneer Uber, chip designer ARM and shared workspace firm WeWork. The company has publicly stated it plans to set up a second investment fund. The senior banking source said Softbank was now talking to banks about helping it raise money, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal. Softbank has spoken to half a dozen banks over the last month about a potential listing of the Vision Fund but has yet to start a formal process, the source said, adding he was not expecting such a process in the near term. “They asked banks questions on how they could possibly do it. It is still very much in exploration mode,” the source said, adding that Softbank had been possibly given the idea by fellow tech investor Naspers, which plans to list some of its assets. “The big difference is that the biggest asset in the Naspers portfolio is Tencent, which is listed, whereas the portfolio of the Vision Fund is all private,” the source said. China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd is a social media and gaming company listed in Hong Kong. A spokesman for Softbank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. SoftBank is also in talks with Oman for an investment in the fund, which has raised nearly all of its funding so far from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, according to the WSJ report. Oman was not immediately available for a comment when contacted by Reuters, nor was there an immediate response from the Japanese conglomerate.      SoftBank is seeking to raise new funds for “informal deals” chief executive officer Masayoshi Son negotiated in China for Vision Fund, one of the people told WSJ. The fund is also planning to double its staff over the next 18 months to keep up with the pace of deal making by SoftBank, the company’s top deputies reportedly said at a conference in Los Angeles this week.

89,Democrats' suit against Trump over foreign payment can proceed: judge - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:32 AM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge ruled on Tuesday that Democrats in Congress can move forward with a lawsuit accusing President Donald Trump of violating the law by accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments through his businesses. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan denied a motion by Trump to dismiss the lawsuit filed by 198 members of Congress. The lawmakers charge the president violated the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which prevents federal officeholders from accepting payments from foreign governments without the “consent” of Congress. The constitutional provision is designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence. Sullivan said in his 48-page decision that he found Trump’s attempt to narrowly define the emoluments clause to be “unpersuasive and inconsistent.” He said he agreed with congressional Democrats who brought the case that the clause should be read more broadly as barring an official from taking any payment of any kind whatsoever from a foreign state without congressional approval. Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said: “As we argued, we believe this case should be dismissed, and we will continue to defend the President in court.” Democratic U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler called the ruling “an important milestone in seeking to hold the President accountable for his ongoing violations” of the emoluments clause. Trump, a wealthy real estate developer who as president regularly visits his own hotels, resorts and golf clubs, maintains ownership of his businesses but has ceded day-to-day control to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. The lawsuit by congressional Democrats is one of two cases against Trump involving the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In the other case, Democratic attorneys general in Maryland and the District of Columbia argued that Trump’s failure to disentangle himself from his hotels and other businesses made him vulnerable to inducements by foreign officials seeking to curry favor. The case was later narrowed to focus specifically on Trump’s hotel in Washington. Since his election, the hotel has become a favored lodging and event space for some foreign and state officials visiting the U.S. capital. A federal judge in that case also rejected Trump’s narrow view that emoluments were limited essentially to outright bribes. But an appeals court is reviewing the case and has temporarily frozen evidence-gathering that could force disclosure of Trump’s financial records.

90,Trump to meet with Republican senators on U.S. shipping rules - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  8:11 PM / 4 days ago","3 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is set to meet with Republican senators on Wednesday over a proposal to waive rules that only U.S.-flagged ships can move natural gas from American ports to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Northeast. The nearly 100-year-old Jones Act mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport merchandise between U.S. coasts. Bloomberg News reported last week the administration was seriously considering waiving the requirements for some energy shipments and that Trump was leaning in favor of some kind of waiver. “I am going to go to the White House tomorrow to try to talk to the president out of doing something foolish and that is trying to curtain the Jones Act protections,” Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, told Reuters on Tuesday. “If that is his inclination, then (Trump) has been receiving some bad advice.” The White House declined to comment. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security waived the requirement for one week to allow oil and gas operators to use often cheaper, tax-free, or more readily available foreign-flagged vessels to ensure enough fuel reached emergency responders during Hurricane Irma and following Hurricane Harvey. A person briefed on the matter confirmed that administration officials were divided on the issue. Republican Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who chairs the Commerce Committee, and a number of other Republicans are set to attend the meeting that had not previously been made public, he said. “There is massive support in the Congress for keeping the Jones Act as it is. We don’t need to tinker with it,” Wicker said on Tuesday, saying it had strong “across-the-board” bipartisan support. At the White House meeting, Wicker said: “We’ll be talking policy and politics.” Any changes would not go over well in Congress “at all, in either party,” he said.  In February, leaders of the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure wrote DHS to oppose a request from Puerto Rico to waive the Jones Act for 10 years to allow foreign tankers to move liquid natural gas to the U.S. island territory. Puerto Rico is still recovering from devastating Hurricane Maria in 2017. Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the committee, and Sam Graves, the panel’s top Republican, said in the letter the Jones Act “has promoted economic growth and national security, and created hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs in our domestic maritime trades and shipbuilding industries.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Peter CooneyAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

91,Mueller complained to Barr about his summary of Russia probe: Washington Post - Reuters,"May 1, 2019 /  12:04 AM / 4 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller complained in a letter to Attorney General William Barr that his four-page summary of Mueller’s Russia report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the investigation’s conclusions, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. The Post said it reviewed a copy of Mueller’s letter, which was written in late March after Barr released a summary on March 24 that said Mueller did not establish that members of President Donald Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia during the 2016 election. Barr also said in the summary that Mueller had not reached a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had found the evidence insufficient to support such a charge. Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec, in a statement, confirmed that Mueller wrote to Barr after the summary was released to express frustration over “the lack of context and the resulting media coverage,” particularly about Mueller’s conclusions on obstruction of justice. Democrats have accused Barr of trying to spin the report’s conclusions to protect Trump. In a statement in response to the Post report, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Barr “should not have taken it upon himself to describe the Special Counsel’s findings in a light more favorable to the President.” The Democratic lawmaker demanded the Justice Department release a copy of Mueller’s letter by Wednesday morning. Barr’s four-page summary was released more than three weeks before a redacted version of Mueller’s 448-page report was released to the public on April 18. “The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” Mueller wrote, according to the Post. “There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations,” the Post quoted Mueller as writing. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment to Reuters. Mueller asked Barr to release the report’s introductions and executive summaries quickly, without waiting for the full report to go through the redaction process. “Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation,” Mueller wrote, according to the Post. Kupec said after receiving Mueller’s letter, Barr called the special counsel and they had a “cordial and professional conversation.” Kupec said “the Special Counsel emphasized nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading.” She said Barr declined Mueller’s request to release part of the report early, deciding “it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion.” Mueller’s letter is likely to be brought up when Barr testifies on Wednesday about the Russia investigation before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It will be the attorney general’s first appearance on Capitol Hill since the report’s release.

92,Germany's RWE to review climate lobbying as investor pressure rises - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:47 PM / in 2 days","2 Min ReadFRANKFURT, May 3 (Reuters) - German utility RWE, under investor pressure as one of Europe’s biggest carbon polluters, said on Friday it would review its lobbying activities to see if they are in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz made the commitment in response to an AGM question from Thomas Deser, a portfolio manager representing Union Investment, which is part of Germany’s cooperative financial services network. Deser had asked whether RWE’s climate strategy was compatible with its lobbying and whether management could demonstrate that those activities did not run counter to its claims of moving towards more sustainable forms of energy. Institutional investors have stepped up pressure on energy firms to take responsibility for their contribution to the greenhouse gases causing climate change and Union Investment is part of a group that has pledged to push for bolder action. Schmitz told shareholders in Essen that RWE would scrutinise the positions adopted by industry associations of which it was a member to see whether they were aligned with the Paris accord. The CEO said RWE, whose huge legacy coal-fired generation capacity in its core markets places it among the biggest carbon polluters in Europe, would publish results in a sustainability report in a year’s time. RWE is committed to spend billions of euros on its planned green energy expansion that will follow an asset swap with rival E.ON later this year.

94,EU leaders set to meet after election: officials - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  9:33 AM / in 2 days","4 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders are expected to meet just after this month’s elections to the European Parliament, officials said on Friday, as national governments brace for a possible clash with lawmakers over who will run the Brussels executive. Summit chair Donald Tusk is likely to invite leaders to a summit on May 28, two days after the last legislative voting, EU officials told Reuters. He would aim to get a clear mandate from the European Council to negotiate with Parliament on who will succeed European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. It could also be the occasion to review whether the results of the May 23 EU ballot in Britain, following the postponement of Brexit, offer any indication on whether British withdrawal from the European Union is likely to proceed as planned. Aides to Council President Tusk declined official comment.  The EU sources said Tusk, who would represent the 28 member state governments in talks with Parliament over key executive appointments, was likely to confirm the proposed meeting when he chairs another summit next Thursday, in Sibiu, Romania. It is “likely but not confirmed yet”, one official said. Leaders also met two days after the last EU election, in May 2014, to debate whom to nominate to head the Commission. Then, Juncker was clear favorite. The former Luxembourg premier led the center-right list which had come top in the parliamentary vote and was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the face of isolated resistance from then British prime minister David Cameron. This time there may be less clarity, even after the election, and officials are bracing for a showdown between the Council and Parliament that could delay putting a new Commission in place before Juncker’s term ends on Oct. 31. The outgoing Parliament resolved that it would not endorse a Commission nominee from the Council who had not been a leader, or ‘Spitzenkandidat’, from a winning party. But national leaders, notably French President Emmanuel Macron, have insisted  they will not be limited in their choice by a legislature whose legitimacy is hampered by chronic low turnouts. As in 2014, the center-right European People’s Party is set to top the poll, putting its lead candidate, German EU lawmaker Manfred Weber, in a position to seek the Commission presidency. His nearest rival would be Juncker’s Dutch deputy, Frans Timmermans, who is the Spitzenkandidat for the center-left. However, neither appears assured of backing by national leaders, for whom the appointment is part of a web of bargains for top jobs that seeks to balance the interests of different countries, types of country, regions and political parties. Other potential - though undeclared - contenders cited by EU officials include Frenchman Michel Barnier, who is Juncker’s  Brexit negotiator, and Danish antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager. The Council should nominate a Commission president at a June 20-21 summit. Parliament, which convenes on July 2, would then debate the appointment. If it withholds its endorsement beyond July, however, the typical timetable would be in jeopardy.  Only once the Commission president is in place can that person then appoint fellow commissioners for policy areas, drawn from the nominees put forward by each member state.

97,A few choice words could lead to better central bank forecasts - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  2:34 PM / 2 days ago","4 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Central bankers didn’t see the Great Recession coming and they could miss the next downturn too, but new research out of the United States points to a possible way to make their predictions a little more accurate. Economists and investors are increasingly training computers to read central bank reports to better understand policymaking or to make bets in financial markets. A group of researchers at George Washington University has created an index for British economic growth based on the words used in a key section of the Bank of England’s quarterly inflation reports. They found that over the last two decades, the index was a pretty good predictor of how quickly the British economy would grow in the quarter after the release of each report. Their algorithm looks at the frequency of words such as “robust,” “brisk” or “soft” in the summary section of the BoE’s quarterly report. While the central bank’s official forecasts were better at predicting growth, the researchers were surprised to discover the text-based score generally moved up or down in a way that would have improved the accuracy of official forecasts. “The forecasts don’t appear to capture all the information the central bank has about the outlook,” said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and a co-author of a working paper that describes the new research.  Graphic: BOE text scoring - tmsnrt.rs/2Wkku8w Sinclair and her fellow researchers based their approach on a technique, have previously applied to the minutes of Fed policy meetings and the forecasts of Fed staff economists. Like all methods of trying to peer into the future, the text score is not 100 percent reliable – it appeared to overestimate the risks of a British recession in 2001. In early 2008, neither the central bank’s forecasts nor the text recognized that a recession was approaching. However, the text score appeared to predict economic deterioration slightly more quickly that year than did the BoE’s growth forecasts. The text scores have been persistently more dour than the central bank’s official forecasts since the June 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to leave the European Union. In the latest quarterly report released on Thursday, the index remained just below zero, suggesting Britain’s year-over-year growth rate might be slightly slower in the third quarter than the 1.17 percent gain the BoE predicts will be announced in November, Sinclair said. It’s possible the BoE has taken to communicating economic risks over a longer-term horizon during the period following the Brexit referendum, making the word-based index less relevant for the short-term outlook. The text score for Thursday’s report was held back by negative words like “falling,” which the central bank used to describe business investment. Business investment in Britain has been weakening for over a year as companies worry about the country’s still undefined future relationship with the EU, something that could change quickly once the Brexit uncertainty lifts. Researchers have found central bankers often outperform private bankers at forecasting. Indeed, BoE Governor Mark Carney on Thursday pointed out to reporters that the central bank’s forecasts over the last year had been very accurate. “Overall GDP growth appears bang in line with our forecast,” he said, while conceding the BoE had not gotten the drivers of the economy right as consumer spending was stronger than forecast while a bounce-back in business investment and exports had failed to materialize.

The Labor Department’s monthly employment report showed jobs increased by 263,000 last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 185,000 rise. The unemployment rate dropped to a more than 49-year low of 3.6%. However, average hourly earnings rose 0.2% in April after rising by the same margin in March and below the anticipated 0.3% rise. “The volatility in equities is somewhat reasonable given the headline numbers were pretty surprising and very positive in this environment,” said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. “It really reiterates Powell’s message on Wednesday, that the economy is in really good shape and inflation is low and that there isn’t any need to make changes to policy right now.” U.S. stocks eased from their record highs in the past two sessions after the Fed dashed hopes of interest rate cuts this year and oil prices fell. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments on weak inflation as mostly “transient” on Wednesday drove down trader bets of a rate cut this year. At 9:45 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128.14 points, or 0.49%, at 26,435.93. The S&P 500 was up 14.31 points, or 0.49%, at 2,931.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.01 points, or 0.63%, at 8,087.79. Nearly 400 S&P 500 companies have reported so far and three-quarters have topped profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. The better-than-expected results have turned around earnings estimate for the first quarter to an almost 1% rise from a 2% decline at the start of April. All the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with a 0.82% rise in consumer discretionary stocks powering the gains. Amazon.com Inc rose 2%, after CNBC reported Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc has bought shares of internet retailing giant for the first time, though he has not been the one doing the buying. Newell Brand Inc shares jumped 8.2% after the consumer goods maker exceeded Wall Street expectations for quarterly adjusted profit as it benefited from cost savings and higher pricing. Cisco Systems Inc dipped 0.3%, after fellow network gear-maker Arista Networks Inc forecast weak current-quarter revenue. Shares of Arista plunged 15.1%, the most among S&P 500 companies. Activision Blizzard Inc fell 4.8% after the videogame maker forecast current-quarter profit below expectations as it puts more money into its franchises to battle competition. Shares of Electronic Arts Inc also declined 3.5% after brokerage MKM Partners downgraded the company’s stock to “neutral” from “buy.” Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.50-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.60-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 16 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 38 new highs and 10 new lows.

100,UPDATE 2-Hudbay Minerals settles board battle with shareholder Waterton - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  1:57 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(Adds shares in third paragraph, details throughout) By Nichola Saminather and Shradha Singh May 3 (Reuters) - Hudbay Minerals Inc said on Friday it had agreed with Waterton Global Resource Management Inc, its second largest shareholder, to seek election of a slate of 11 board members that includes nominees proposed by both parties. The agreement settles a proxy contest with the private equity firm, which nominated five directors to the Canadian miner’s board, two of whom the company accepted before one dropped out. Hudbay shares rose 2.1 percent to C$8.78 in early trading in Toronto, compared with the Toronto stock benchmark’s 0.25 percent gain. “We are not overly surprised as we had assumed that the Board would see only a minor change as a result of Waterton’s efforts,” Mark Llanes, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note. “Overall, we view this settlement positively.” The 11 directors include Chair Alan Hibben and current director Igor Gonzales, whom Waterton had sought to replace, and Waterton nominees Peter Kukielski and Daniel Muniz Quintanilla. The rest, including Chief Executive Alan Hair and David Smith, a Waterton nominee whom Hudbay had already accepted, had not been in dispute. Only votes on the agreed-upon nominees will be considered at Hudbay’s annual shareholder meeting on May 7, the company said. Both companies have also agreed to look for a successor as chair to Hibben following the meeting. After Hibben steps down as chair, he will remain on the board until the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. Waterton, which owns a 12.1 percent stake in Hudbay Minerals, last month sued Hudbay to stop it from soliciting proxies for its annual shareholder meeting, alleging material omissions related to an earlier acquisition attempt. Much of Waterton’s ire against Hudbay surrounded alleged talks the company had to acquire Chile’s Mantos Copper for about $780 million last year, which Bloomberg reported in October.

102,"With Biden in, crowded 2020 Democratic field starts to get feisty - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  7:53 PM / 4 days ago","5 Min ReadWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 2020 Democratic White House race, until now a cordial affair with no personal attacks and few policy disputes, is starting to get scrappy. Since former Vice President Joe Biden entered last week as the front-runner to win the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has taken a swing at Biden’s support for global trade deals and his 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war. Former Congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas questioned Biden’s backing from big-money outside political groups, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has noted Biden’s work “on the side of the credit card companies.” Washington Governor Jay Inslee took aim at a different rival, criticizing O’Rourke’s congressional record on climate change after O’Rourke unveiled a $5 trillion plan to invest in clean energy technology and infrastructure. With 20 Democrats vying for attention in the battle for the right to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in 2020, some in the party said it was only a matter of time before they began to turn on each other. And Biden, clearly in the lead in polls, provides an easy target for the herd now that he has formally joined the race. “It’s just the beginning,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a senior adviser to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “In a big field, there will be some early skirmishes as people position themselves.” The criticism of Biden, a centrist who spent eight years as President Barack Obama’s No. 2, is an early glimpse of the sort of attacks he is likely to face from his more liberal rivals in a race that will be heavily influenced by the party’s progressive activists. Sanders, the independent who challenged Clinton from the left during the 2016 Democratic primary, criticized Biden’s past support of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other trade deals that he says have cost Americans jobs. “When people take a look at my record versus Vice President Biden’s record — I helped lead the fight against NAFTA, he voted for NAFTA,” Sanders said on CNN on Monday night, adding that he also helped lead the fight against permanent normal trade relations with China, which Biden supported. “I strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership; he supported it. I voted against the war in Iraq; he voted for it,” Sanders said. “I like Joe Biden; Joe is a friend of mine,” he said. “I think what we need to do with all of the candidates is have an issue-oriented campaign, not personal attacks.” In a fundraising appeal on Tuesday, O’Rourke’s team noted Biden’s support from a super PAC, one of many outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money but are not affiliated with the campaign. “We’re trying to campaign the right way — the real way — by traveling across the country and listening to Americans, and by relying on the support of regular, everyday people chipping in what they can afford,” the O’Rourke fundraising appeal said.      Warren said at a campaign event after Biden’s entrance in the race last week that Biden had taken the side of credit card companies in a 2005 vote on a bill that made it harder for some people to file for bankruptcy. Biden, who spent more than three decades as the U.S. senator from Delaware, has long been criticized by liberals for his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in the state. Inslee, who has put his efforts to fight climate change at the forefront of his long-shot campaign for the White House, criticized O’Rourke and his climate change plan. “Beto O’Rourke will need to answer why he did not lead on climate change in Congress and why he voted on the side of oil companies to open up offshore drilling,” he said in a statement on Monday. Palmieri said the attacks were flying early in a Democratic race that will not have its first nominating contest until early February 2020 in Iowa, but that was to be expected in a historically crowded field. While Sanders has always been willing to confront those he disagrees with, she said, some other top contenders might hold off until later in the year on drawing contrasts with their opponents. “Right now, no one is fighting for their life,” she said. “Those who see themselves as more viable contenders can have some caution about picking a fight too early.” Editing by Kieran Murray and Jonathan OatisAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

103,Oprah 'quietly figuring out' how to wield her political clout in 2020 - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  7:23 PM / in 4 days","3 Min ReadLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Media mogul Oprah Winfrey, whose opinions can get millions of fans to try a new diet or turn a book into an international best-seller, is figuring out which Democratic candidate she will endorse in the crowded 2020 U.S. presidential race. Winfrey, who has ruled out running for the White House, told the Hollywood Reporter in an extensive interview released on Tuesday that she was “quietly figuring out where I’m going to use my voice in support.” “I’m sitting back, waiting to see. It’ll be very clear who I’m supporting,” she said of the 2020 election campaign. Winfrey campaigned heavily for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but adopted a lower profile in her support of Hillary Clinton, who lost in 2016 to current Republican President Donald Trump. Some 20 Democrats are running for president in 2020. Winfrey said among the Democrats she is researching are South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and California Senator Kamala Harris. She said she already knows New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Winfrey, a billionaire movie producer, television network  owner, magazine publisher and philanthropist, was urged by her supporters to run for the White House herself after delivering a  rousing speech at the 2018 Golden Globe awards ceremony. She has repeatedly ruled out the idea. Winfrey is also an actress who was Oscar-nominated for her supporting role in the 1985 film “The Color Purple.” She also had a major role in the 2018 film “A Wrinkle in Time,” and appeared in “Selma” and “The Butler” as well as the series “Greenleaf” on OWN TV, the Oprah Winfrey Network. But with a series of documentaries and interview shows lined up for the upcoming Apple TV+ streaming service, Winfrey said she was no longer interested in acting. “I think to be really, really good at it, you’ve got to do it a lot. You’ve got to work at it. And it’s got to be something that you have true passion about. I don’t think it’s something you can dabble in,” she said. “It doesn’t feed my soul anymore.” Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by David GregorioAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The White House said earlier that Trump was acting following a request from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief in 2013 engineered the removal of freely elected President Mohamed Mursi, a senior Brotherhood figure, and a subsequent crackdown on its supporters.  “We will remain ... steadfast in our work in accordance with our moderate and peaceful thinking and what we believe to be right, for honest and constructive cooperation to serve the communities in which we live, and humanity as a whole,” the Brotherhood said in a statement on its official website. “The Muslim Brotherhood will remain stronger - through God’s grace and power - than any decision.” Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Brotherhood came to power in the country’s first modern free election in 2012, a year after former President Hosni Mubarak was toppled in an uprising. After Mursi was himself overthrown in 2013, the Brotherhood was swiftly banned. Egyptian authorities have declared it a terrorist organization and jailing thousands of its followers and much of its leadership, including Mursi. The Brotherhood says it is a non-violent movement and denies any relationship to violent insurgencies waged by al Qaeda and Islamic State militants.

Chief Executive Candido Bracher said the bank reduced its 2019 targets for fee income and financial margins with clients after its card processor Rede decided to stop charging interest rates to advance payments for merchants who use its machines and pay them in two days instead of the usual 30-day period. Still, Bracher said new targets are unlikely to change the bank’s profit, as Itaú also reduced its estimate for operating expenses growth to a range between 3 percent and 6 percent, from between 5 percent and 8 percent. Bracher said, however, the cut in operating expenses is related to Brazil’s slower-than-expected economic recovery and will affect all Itaú’s areas. Upstart card processors such as PagSeguro Digital Ltd and StoneCo Ltd in recent years have challenged mainstream banks’s card businesses. All Brazilian card processors have fought back Rede’s move and announced new offers for small and mid-sized merchants, in a price war rarely seen in the concentrated Brazilian financial system. “We maintain our call that the aggressive pricing strategy adopted by Rede will have a negative effect on banking fees in the short term, while in the medium-to-long term it should increase the banking franchise’s cross-sell opportunities,” analysts at Banco Santander SA said in a note to clients. Itaú posted a recurring net income of 6.87 billion reais ($1.74 billion) on Thursday, up 7.1% from the year-ago period and roughly in line with a Refinitiv analysts’ consensus estimate.

112,"UPDATE 1-Brazil industrial output slumps in March, underscores weak Q1 growth - Reuters","May 3, 2019 /  1:02 PM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(Adds detail, context, quote) By Jamie McGeever BRASILIA, May 3 (Reuters) - Brazil’s industrial production fell 1.3 percent in March from the month before, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, a steeper fall than economists had expected and another indication of the economy’s sub-par performance in the first quarter. It was the biggest decline in six months, almost double the median estimate of a 0.7 percent fall in a Reuters poll of economists, and weighed heavily on the longer-term measures of industrial output. Production slumped 6.1 percent compared with the same month last year, the biggest annual decline since May last year, IBGE said, although the statistics agency noted that there were 19 working days in March this year compared with 21 last year. Output in the first quarter was down 2.2 percent compared with the January-March period last year, and over the past 12 months production is now down 0.1 percent on the previous 12 months. That’s the first cumulative decline since August 2017, IBGE said. “Today’s weak print increases the risk of a negative quarterly sequential real GDP growth figure for the first quarter of 2019,” wrote Alberto Ramos, head of the Latin American Economic Research at Goldman Sachs, in a note. Brazil’s “long underperforming” industrial sector should slowly start to recover, Ramos said, but will continue to face headwinds from weak activity in Argentina, a major market for Brazilian manufacturing exports. The weak performance was spread across most industries and sectors. Production of intermediary goods fell 1.5 percent on the month, consumer durables fell 1.3 percent and semi- and non-durable consumer goods fell 1.1 percent, IBGE said. In terms of sectors, the 4.9 percent slide in food production was the biggest single contributory factor to the overall decline, IBGE said. Auto production fell 3.2 percent, and petroleum and biofuels products output fell 2.7 percent. In March, Brazil’s central bank reduced its forecast for industrial production growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2.9 percent, a key factor behind the redaction of its overall 2019 GDP growth forecast to 2.0 percent from 2.4 percent.

113,CORRECTED-PRECIOUS-Gold eyes worst week since end-March ahead of U.S. jobs data - Reuters,"May 3, 2019 /  10:32 AM / in 2 days","3 Min Read(In fourth paragraph, corrects percentage fall to 1 percent from 10 percent) * U.S. non-farm payrolls data due at 1230 GMT * Gold about 1.2 pct down so far this week * SPDR Gold holdings fall to lowest in nearly 7 months * Platinum touches one-month low By K. Sathya Narayanan May 3 (Reuters) - Gold was steady on Friday as the market awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data but was headed for its biggest weekly decline since the end of March, as the dollar gained after the U.S. central bank doused expectations of a near-term rate cut. Spot gold was steady at $1,270.59 per ounce, as of 1144 GMT. In the previous session, the metal dropped to $1,265.85, its lowest since the end of December. U.S. gold futures were also flat at $1,271.60 an ounce. Gold has fallen more than 1 percent in the last two sessions and is down over 1 percent this week after the U.S. Federal Reserve emphasised it saw no compelling reason to consider a rate cut any time soon. “People expected the next move from the Fed to be a rate cut but it doesn’t look like there would be a rate cut anytime soon and the risk of another hike on the table increased after his statement,” Quantitative Commodity Research analyst Peter Fertig said. “(Right now) people are holding back and are waiting for the U.S. non-farm payrolls data ... the dollar is heading higher which is negative for the precious metals complex.” Better-than-expected non-farm payrolls data tends to boost the dollar, as it would reinforce the economy’s strength, and weigh on gold, analysts said. Economists polled by Reuters are expecting total non-farm employment to have increased by 185,000 jobs in April. The dollar was up about 0.2 percent against key rivals and was on track to post its third straight session of gains. Market participants were also keeping a close watch on U.S.-China trade talks, anticipating a resolution to the year long tariff war between the world’s two largest economies. A trade deal would boost investors appetite for riskier assets and dent bullion’s safe-haven appeal. Reflecting investor sentiment towards bullion, holdings in the world’s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), SPDR Gold Trust, fell about 0.2 percent to 745.52 tonnes on Thursday, its lowest since Oct. 12. “The ETF holdings in gold continue to decline and in the last few week specs on COMEX switched from net long to net short as there is a risk on approach from investors,” said ING analyst Warren Patterson. Silver was up 0.3 percent at $14.67 per ounce, holding close to a more than four-month low of $14.52 touched in the previous session. Platinum rose 0.5 percent to $851.78 an ounce, having touched a one-month low of $839 earlier in the session, while palladium dipped 0.4 percent to $1,349.30 an ounce. (Reporting by K.

115,Foxconn chairman travels to White House to discuss Wisconsin: source - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  10:35 AM / 5 days ago","2 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - The chairman of Apple supplier Foxconn will travel to the United States on Tuesday for a meeting in the White House that is believed to be related to an investment in Wisconsin, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Foxconn said this month it remains committed to its contract to build a display plant and tech research facilities in Wisconsin, days after the U.S. state’s governor said he wanted to renegotiate the deal.  In January, Reuters reported that Foxconn is reconsidering plans to make advanced liquid crystal display panels at a $10 billion Wisconsin campus, and said it intends to hire mostly engineers and researchers rather than the manufacturing workforce the project originally promised. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple Inc, has pledged to eventually create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin, but said this year it had slowed its pace of hiring. The source said it wasn’t yet clear if Gou would meet U.S. President Donald Trump. No further details were given. A spokesman for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, the formal name of Foxconn, said the firm wouldn’t comment on the chairman’s itinerary. Gou, 69, said recently that he would step back from the helm of Foxconn, which is a major supplier for a slew of electronic giants including Apple, to try for a run at becoming Taiwan’s next president in an election next January. Gou, who owns 9.4 percent of Foxconn as its top shareholder, is Taiwan’s richest person with a net worth of $7.6 billion, according to Forbes.  Last month, Foxconn reported a smaller than expected fall in quarterly profit, despite warning signs from key customers including Apple that demand for tech electronics was softening.

116,Trump sues Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block House subpoenas - Reuters,"April 30, 2019 /  4:45 AM / 5 days ago","3 Min Read(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, three of his children and seven of his companies filed a federal lawsuit Monday against Deutsche Bank and Capital One Financial Corp to block the banks from complying with federal subpoenas investigating his financial dealings. The federal lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court’s Southern District of New York, contended that demands for records by Democrat-controlled House committees have no legitimate or lawful purpose. “The subpoenas were issued to harass President Donald J. Trump, to rummage through every aspect of his personal finances, his businesses, and the private information of the President and his family,” the lawsuit said. It also complains that the Democrats are hoping “they will stumble upon something they can expose publicly and use as a political tool against the President.” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the Financial Services Commission and Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, both Democrats, called the lawsuit “meritless” in a joint statement, the New York Times and other media reported. On April 15, two U.S. House of Representatives committees issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump’s finances. Both banks have been involved in Trump’s real estate empire. “The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern. The Financial Services Committee is exploring these matters, including as they may involve the president and his associates, as thoroughly as possible,” Waters, said in a statement earlier. Schiff said previously in a statement the subpoenas issued included a “friendly subpoena to Deutsche Bank.” Trump recently has said that he intends to defy any efforts from the Democrats to dig into his affairs. Among other things, the Democrats have been looking into possible dealings Trump might have with Russia. The suit, which includes The Trump Organization Inc. and Trump’s three eldest children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, states that the court has the power to declare the subpoenas invalid. A representative of Deutsche Bank said in a statement: “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.” Attorneys and representatives for the two sides were not immediately available to Reuters late Monday.

117,"Explainer: Probes spawned by Mueller target Trump business, others - Reuters","April 30, 2019 /  10:03 AM / 5 days ago","5 Min Read(Reuters) - Numerous investigations spun out of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe are still alive and kicking, presenting potential ongoing legal and political risk for President Donald Trump, some of his former advisers and others. Even though Trump avoided a knockout blow from the April 18 Mueller report, the special counsel disclosed more than a dozen  active criminal inquiries that will play out for months to come, some possibly into the 2020 election campaign season. Details on most of these cases are unclear as they were redacted in the 448-page report. Only two were not blacked out: one case versus former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen; and one versus Greg Craig, a former White House counsel in the Obama administration. The following are some of the topics likely being examined in spun-off probes by federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere: Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating the spending and fundraising of Trump’s inaugural committee. They are also probing the Trump Organization’s role in payments made to silence two women about alleged sexual encounters with Trump before the 2016 election. Both probes emanated from the Cohen case. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to his role in the hush-money payments. Prosecutors effectively named Trump an unindicted co-conspirator in the scheme, which they say was aimed at influencing the election in violation of campaign finance laws. Trump has denied the affairs and any wrongdoing. In February public testimony, Cohen gave Congress copies of checks signed by Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, reimbursing Cohen for the payments. The Mueller report shows Cohen, slated to start a three-year prison sentence on May 6, was interviewed by federal authorities as recently as March 19 on topics ranging from negotiations during the campaign about building a Trump tower in Moscow to talks concerning a potential presidential pardon for Cohen. A Mueller probe mystery is why prosecutors in late 2018 sent right-wing author Jerome Corsi a draft plea agreement. It asked him to admit to lying to investigators about his communications with Trump adviser Roger Stone on WikiLeaks. Prosecutors never followed through on the threat to charge Corsi. Corsi, who said he rejected the plea offer and maintains his innocence, told Reuters on Friday he was confident he would not be charged. If he is not, he would avoid the fate of Stone, who was indicted by Mueller in January for allegedly lying to Congress about his pursuit of information on stolen Democratic Party emails that were made public by Russia and Wikileaks. Stone, who was not charged with conspiring with Russians or WikiLeaks, pleaded not guilty and is preparing for trial. Mueller’s report blacked out significant passages related to WikiLeaks, perhaps indicating that WikiLeaks or its founder Julian Assange are under ongoing scrutiny related to dissemination of emails during the 2016 election. Earlier this month, U.S. prosecutors unsealed charges against Assange alleging he conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 to gain access to a U.S. government network used for classified documents. The U.S. is seeking Assange’s extradition from London. Mueller’s investigation ensnared several people for failing to register with the Justice Department as foreign agents. Among them were Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, formerly Trump’s campaign chairman and deputy chairman, for their lobbying work in the United States for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. These cases reflected a new Justice Department focus on the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires people advocating on behalf of a foreign power to disclose that work. Craig’s case involves one of the Ukrainian-related projects that formed the basis of Mueller’s probe of Manafort. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also examining prominent Washington lobbyists Vin Weber and Tony Podesta for Ukrainian-related work directed by Manafort. Congressional committees probing Russia’s 2016 election meddling encouraged Mueller to look at the veracity of the past testimony of witnesses.  Mueller already charged Stone and Cohen with lying to Congress. It is possible that other potential cases have been referred elsewhere in the Justice Department. For instance, the Mueller report showed that Erik Prince, founder of the now defunct security firm Blackwater USA and a Trump supporter, may have misled Congress on details of contact he had with a Russian banker in January 2017.
